 should have known. The damage is done. I feel bad. I go back to my room where I see Aunt Naomi has rearranged all my furniture and the bedroom is now like an alcove connected with the living room. My bed is now like a slide. I crawl up to the flat platform at the top and my water bottle goes sliding down. I am very uncomfortable as I'll slide off and down if I relax at all. I see large windows and a huge space which used to be crowded with furniture. I go into the living room part and see how some of my furniture is intermixed with the living room furniture. (301 words)

I am outdoors and cooking some stew on a burner of a stove. Or my mother is and I go stir it. Clothes are laying all over the stove and I am trying to get them off the burner so they don't catch on fire. Corinne is talking about something. She says, "Communication sure is hard." I agree and say, "But it's worth working it through." Then my mother says, "Then I suppose I have to tell you (Corinne) what Sue said." I can see they are going to have a hard time working through this without getting angry at each other. I try to help out. I then look up in the sky and see my father hang gliding. He does it every day, for his health, like exercise. I lose sight of him and then find him again and wave. Then I see the sky is filled with hang gliders, hundreds of them. Some of them are landing in the huge river in front of the stove. (169 words)

I'm taking a shower with Marshall Peters. Somehow this is working with the clients together. The shower stream of water is very thin and weak. Now I'm showering with Lucy, only instead of us doing it together, we take turns. I lather up with thick globs of shampoo soap. I am dressed, so when I lift up the blouse and rub my tummy, I get the dress wet. in spots. Then I eat something. Then Marshall comes in and talks about his client, who is a mess and does everything wrong and can't keep herself or her house clean. I realize with surprise he's talking about his wife.

There is a huge warehouse room and inside are screaming, terrorized people being mass murdered by machine gun fire. One of the bad guys, a woman, comes outside, because it is so horrible she can't bear it. She fires one bullet out of her machine gun in the general direction of others like her that are doing the killing. I sense that if she gets stronger, she will be able to defend and stop the mass killing. Some blood seeps out from under the door jamb. An umbrella with a spot of blood comes out and then a young teen woman in a yellow lace and satin knee-length prom dress, wrapped in a plastic bag, comes out. She will suffocate if she can't get out of the bag. Another young woman comes by and tries to untie the knot on the bag saying, "I'll undo the pie." The feeling is one of distance. I don't see the carnage, only small spots of blood and they are in a room. But I know this distant terror is real and could become close and be felt. (184 words)

Derek and I arrive at a house. The meeting will start soon, maybe a dream group meeting. Some of the people are arriving. I can't get my car parked. The gate is locked and I'd have to get out and unlock it. I'm across the other lane of the road where the road curves downhill and a car is coming, so I move the car to a rocky spot. It won't fit. I turn around and someone gets in and I get out. They will park the car. Now I go in. Derek arrives and comes in. We greet each other with a kiss and quickly we are passionately kissing and want to find a place to be alone to make love. We go to several different rooms and find a bedroom. We make love. I hold his head in my hands. It is a small head. I can't see his face well. He is feeling only down to his chest. As we wriggle around he groans in pleasure with pain. I ask, "Am I hurting you?" He says, "Yes, but it is OK," as it also is the orgasm. We desperately want each other. (195 words)

Derek and I are going to make love. A young girl, maybe Charla, is there. I'm sending her off to her room. I need to go pee. I ask him, "My place or yours?" He says, "Your place." I go find a toilet and pee a lot. Then this bathroom connects to my bedroom. I go in just as he is opening the door to the bedroom from the hall. He is standing, wearing a tank top and some leotard-like, flesh-colored outfit, like he's naked, only he's not. His legs don't move, and in fact I don't see legs. He's sort of stiff. We make love passionately. Now I go out and see Derek in a car. There are five cop cars in a line and his car is right behind them, a perfectly safe place to be. Another man is in the backseat of Derek's car and he opens the door and invites me in. I get in, happy to be alone with Derek. I curl up with the other man who says it's OK to press back against him if it's more comfortable. Derek gets out to rearrange himself and his assistant helps him back into the car. We are going to be together and that makes me happy. [BL] (211 words)

A small "grandma" mouse is in danger. A snake is coming toward her and will swallow her whole. I am concerned and squeamish. Then the snake thinks to itself, "I'll try a different approach. I'll go slow and hypnotize her and then pounce." He moves slowly toward her, head on. She watches. I want to call out, "Run. Run." Then the snake goes inside her mouth, instead of swallowing her. She has the opportunity to save herself by biting off the snake's head. I am squeamish because I don't want to watch or hear it, but she doesn't do it. Her mouth is a huge "O" shape as the snake puts his head inside. (114 words)

Storm Kennedy and I are looking at a pile of photos and magazine pictures I've collected. We go into another room. A man is there and I park my wheelchair next to him. He is going to explain some financial matter to me. He asks if I have any popcorn and I say, "Yes, I do." I go to the counter across the room where there are many, many small drawers, like in a kitchen. I look in each drawer and discover I'm out of the microwave popcorn packages. I see a few piles of spilled popcorn seeds, but it would be too much work to pop them the old-fashioned way. In another drawer are more magazine pictures and photos. I pick up a sort of radio earphone thing, but it's not what I thought it was. It was supposed to be a " _____ticket". (145 words)

The children, maybe five or seven of them, are being noisy and interrupting and I can't do my writing. I am angry and slam the door to keep them out of my writing room. They pound on the door and yell and I am furious. All I want is some peace and quiet so I can write. I push things off my desk and grab a typewriter and begin to furiously type anything that comes to mind. A pretty good story gets done. I determinedly finish it, ignoring as best I can the unruly children. Now I go out into the living room. It's a mess, with furniture moved all around, stuff all over. I go out to the mailbox on the porch and get the mail. As I am looking at what came, I see maybe five vans or station wagons pull up. The kids are back home. One vehicle is for Dovre, one for Ellie and her family and so on. I am surprised there are so many. I see that the clothes I had ordered for Howard's Christmas present have come in the mail. Now I call to the kids to come into the house NOW. I am angry and demand they come. They saunter in, being insolent and rude. I slap some on the face repeatedly. I yell at them. I make them all sit on the couch and I rail into them. I say, "Things are going to change around here." I know 50% of this is my fault and 50% is their fault. I hear me thinking (for them) that if there are five of them and 50% is their total fault, then only ___% is each individual's share of the fault. I sneer and say, "Let's get on with the important stuff." One goes to the fridge in the kitchen. I lunge after him screaming, "Get back here NOW." Two little ones wander off the couch and I say, "Out. Get out and never come back." They finally leave. I feel a little sad, but determined to gain control and not be taken so advantaged of. "Things are going to be different from now on," I say and begin to lay down the rules. They continue to snipe and not pay attention. (379 words)

I have written a book. I am looking at it and notice that I've tried to sketch a few illustrations. As I turn the pages, I notice that the illustrations get better and better with more detail. I think, "I'd like to show this to Derek, so he'd see I tried to do art work too." Then, I see the book is larger and the illustrations are in color and they are very detailed. I wonder if I had done these; probably not, since they are so good. I can't do this well. The first pictures were pencil sketches of hands, somewhat crooked fingers, like mine many years ago. I think, "That's interesting they are like mine," and then I think, "But, of course, they are. People create art like themselves." One picture is over two pages, a skeleton in the sand on a desert island. The next page is his skull. Then there are missiles with smaller missiles coming out of them, four pictures in a vertical row showing the smaller missile coming out. "Looks phallic," I think. I examine the picture closely, thinking, "Naw, there's no way I could have done this one. Maybe I did a collage, but it is obviously not a collage." Now I close the book and look over to Howard, who is in a narrow bed. Under the bed are piles of my clothes. I see a huge ant who picked up a crumb or a maggot and is lugging it over to the clothes to eat it. I am fascinated. I look at the bed and think, "If you put a box over it, a person could set it up so you'd have everything you'd need there. A great bed for an invalid." It looked a bit like a coffin. Now a little girl comes in. I'd heard her in the bathroom throwing up. She is crying. I say, "Not feeling good, huh?" I feel a bit guilty for not having gone to help her. Then she looks distraught and I see she's having diarrhea. I say, "Oh, it looks like you've got the stomach flu. Go on into the bathroom. It's all right." She has left little piles of shit like chili con carne on the floor. I follow her in to help clean her up, only now I see the toilet is overflowing. Water is all over. She's crying. I yell down the hall to my father, "Hey the toilet is overflowing. Come help get the water cleaned up." He comes out to help. The girl is mopping up water with towels. It's a mess. (435 words)

Sparky wants to plug in a string of Christmas lights that have a short circuit in them, or rather the switch in the wall does. The lights go on and off. I suggest she try another switch or plug in. Kenneth comes in dressed in a graduation gown, a witch's hat and funky platform-heeled shoes. Sparky is a bit taken aback. I say, "He's like that," somewhat proudly. Kenneth grabs the string of lights and says, "Let's try plugging them in over here." I am pleased he has the same thoughts as I do and acts upon them. Now he's hungry and wants to eat. He grabs a hamburger from a buffet bar in the center of the room and another one for Sparky. She says she doesn't want it. So he puts it back and places two sandwiches there. A fat, bald baby is sitting there and she takes a huge bite out of the sandwich. I go to her to stop her from eating Kenneth's food. Her mouth is overflowing with mayo. She's sliding off the high chair. I have a bag in my left hand and am trying to keep her from falling off the chair and keep feeding her too. I wonder why I didn't think to put down the bag so I could use both hands. Then a man is laying on the floor. His face is pudgy and bald like the baby's. He says he's joined the Marines. I say, teasing, "They only want a few good men," and he and I say together, "but if you're not a good man, they'll make your life hell." We laugh. [BL] (274 words)

I am auditioning for a play. I am the only woman trying out for the "Alice" role. Four men are there to try out. One is skinny, one is short, one is very tall, like 7 feet, 5 inches. When he comes out on stage (I am in center stage as these men come out and they then go sit on a bench behind me), the director teases him about his height. I gently admonish the director not to make fun of people who are different. I figure this audition will be pretty easy, since I'm the only woman trying out. I'm given a fat script held together by paper clips. Now other women come out and it's not so cinchy any more. I'm told to read the part of Ana. I look for where she comes in. Three other women are on stage doing parts and I am now concerned and struggling to find the place they are at in the script so I know when to enter. The more I try to find the place, the more messed up the pages get. Now the script is in two or three major chunks. I hear them say, "Ana." I know they are waiting for me to enter. I come out and say to the director, "I can't find the right page. I think it's missing in the script." I go to the front of the stage. It is very high up from the auditorium floor. The stage is slippery and I'm in socks. I can barely keep myself from sliding right off the edge and falling. The director is very distant, way down there, and he's annoyed. He's also concerned that if my script is messed up, maybe others are too. I feel guilty because I know it's my fault I can't find the page, not that it is missing, but I don't say anything. I have to grasp the curtains (a flannel or felt material -- one yellow, the other another color, perhaps blue or green) in order to stop myself from falling off the stage. The director gives me an 800 number I can call to get another script and dismisses me. I go back to try again to find the missing page, because if I go call the number, it will take too long and I'll lose out. The director has lost interest in me. (399 words)

I live in a house. Katrina and Derek are there to visit. I give them a tour. I live in the older part, which is equivalent to a 2-bedroom small house. The back bedroom was a remodeled add-on. Derek says, "There's one bedroom that isn't being used." I say, "Not only that, but there is more to this house. I like it better. It's bigger and the rooms are more interesting." I go down the hall and pass through two kitchens, each one fully equipped. The one in the hall has two refrigerators. I open the French-doors with glass squares to the spacious living room. There are big windows on the far wall, very nice. We look in. It is fairly empty. I wonder why I don't live here, and not in the small older square room I currently live in. I go on down the hall and show a bedroom, and at the end of the hall is a double connecting door. I try it to make sure and the inner door is locked, meaning the other side of this house is occupied with other people. I remember that last year I lived for a while in this side and had a hospital bed in the bedroom. I can't remember why I moved back to the older part. Now I want to go into the spacious living room and show Derek. We go in. I notice a hilly knoll of grass that needs to be tended to on the floor. I see two fireplaces and a kerosene heater, and a small electric heater. I see bookshelves on the wall, only it is all covered with knickknacks and clocks. Derek says, "You've got some really weird stuff in here." I say, "It's not mine." I look around. Lots of the clocks have seashells on them for decoration. One clock has two small secondhand circles. The hands are going around very fast. Derek asks me if I ever go to the coast to write. I say yes, I'd been to N City. He asks if I liked it. I say yes. I keep looking around and see a lawyer's glassed bookcase with weird knickknacks and wine bottles in it. I want the case, but not what's in it. Now we go to the bedroom and look around. A woman is there. Paulina at about 5 or 6 years is there. Derek and I had left our wheelchairs in the hall. He walked with a limp and a cane. I got back into my chair so he wouldn't feel bad. Now see Derek is seated in the wicker chair at a small wicker dining table. I choose to remain in my wheelchair and bump the table several times. I know it would be more comfortable if I transferred also, but I stubbornly don't. Paulina and I are talking about last year. We're playing a card game. (I wake up for a few moments and go right back into the dream. I am aware that I've dreamt this house before.) Now Derek and I are in another room and Paulina mentions a bunny. "Oh," says Derek, "I want to see the bunnies." I sit where I am and Derek goes into another part of the store and returns with a towel. He puts it in my lap. I know by this that he's decided he wants a bunny. He goes back to pick out one. I say, after he's out of the room, "I want to help choose. Paulina had a bunny last year. I want one of the round cute fuzzy ones." He goes upstairs and comes back with a flat kind of bunny. Now I have a lap full of six baby bunnies and a mother bunny, maybe the one from last year comes in and nests with them, like a mama bird. Another white one comes in. I pet it and it meows. I am surprised it is a cat and still wants to nurture the baby bunnies. (668 words)

A deaf female teacher/star is being sued by her husband over the lyrics of her song. The school board makes a ruling. She and the husband drive to the school to get the decision. A hired man (agent or something) is driving the car. There is a circle cul-de-sac and on the curb is the board, who are playing a tape of the song. This somehow is an embarrassment to the woman singer and she's pissed. So as they drive around the circle, she says to the driver, "Do it," meaning speed up the car, drive it up over the curb and over the lawn and through a sculpture; destructive. The driver pleads with her not to order him to do this. He says, "Please. I'm asking. I'm begging you. I'm demanding. I'm refusing." She stiffly and angrily orders him to do it. Against his own wishes, he then starts to obey her. Some woman (perhaps me) in the back seat reaches over and grabs the wheel and they fight as the woman tries to force them to not hit the sculpture. They crash and someone, the driver or the woman, is now walking alongside the singer, screaming at her angrily! "Damn it! You could be the most kind, helpful, loving person in the world with all the gifts you have and you choose to be destructive and mean. Why? Why do you do this?" She won't listen. She's too haughty and angry. (243 words)

I am in bed reading an article about the bus driver's getting a raise. A woman is interviewed. She'd gotten her raise just an hour ago. There's like a puzzle in the paper to fill out, the name of the driver, married or not, etc. I am trying to guess her name and write "Christina." Another name was a man's name and also ended in an "a." All of them did. In the interview, which I see happening, the woman driver says "I'm a family person. This raise gives me insurance for my husband and so on. Some people think it's frivolous to..." Then suddenly I'm aware there is a man in my bedroom. I am startled. He talks softly, but I am worried. There had been snipings lately and he'd somehow entered even though I'd locked the door. I remain calm. He chats about the bus driver's raise. I get up and try to encourage him to leave, pretending to be interested in the conversation. He goes toward the door, but then sits at the dinette table by the window by the door. He's gotten a cup of coffee. "It's too hot," he says. I realize he made it himself and the coffee machine is still on. I find that ominous. I humor him. He's scaringly calm and friendly. Finally he gets up and goes out, still chatting. As he goes toward the apartment stairwell, I shut the door, then reopen it to hook the lock on the screen door. He laughs and says, "Now why would you lock the door like that now? It wasn't locked before. I nervously say, "Oh, you can't be too careful." I notice the hook and eye are not properly attached and it will be of no help. I push the lock button on the door knob and shut the door. I think to myself, "He looks just like Robert Dinero. I rush to the phone to call the police. I am afraid. (330 words)

I am in bed asleep. Nate comes in. He wants to make love, so he starts his charming patter. He kisses me and I say, "Ummmm." He says, "What does a woman mean when she says "ummmm," and I lie and say, "It means, 'Oh, how interesting,'" but what it really means is "God that feels good. I want it." I ask him to leave. I get up. He follows me and holds me close. He puts his penis in as we are standing. I say, "No, not here, someone could walk by and see." We are in front of the open screen door (same place as first dream). So we're walking around clinging and he's kissing me. We go into another bedroom and start to lay down on the floor. I'm sitting on him. Then a young crazy man comes in and stands near us. He's talking to himself and has papers and shirts and they fall on the floor. Nate and I ask him to leave. He mumbles incoherently as he tries to gather up his stuff. Nate and I sit there, still coupled sexually, waiting. I help the young man hang up a shirt (white office work shirt) on a wire hanger. The hook is crooked. He hangs it up in his mouth, stretching his mouth out very wide. We uncouple and stand up, trying to herd the young man out. He asks if he can keep something. We get him to the porch. Now he and Nate have words and start to fist fight. I say, "Don't please." A woman comes up, a homeless woman looking for the ame place the young man was looking for. It is obviously the wrong address. There's a Styrofoam cooler with something rotten in it, and the man wants to know if he can have some. I say "Yes." He takes some. Now I see there is some strange metal ramp enclosed thing on the porch screwed into the railing. I see an elaborate (articulated sections) iron lung gadget next to it. The young man starts tinkering with the iron lung thing. I say, "It will get broken." Nate says, "Whose is it?" I say, "The government wanted to keep it here for awhile. I'm responsible." Nate says, "Did you agree to watch over it?" I said, "No." Then, he says, "You aren't responsible." I notice I am trying to unscrew the other thing and stop that. I would like these things gone, but somehow they'd been foisted on to me. So as Nate and I are watching, the man dismantles parts of the iron lung thing. I'm wishing that they'd go away so I could finish making love to Nate. Nate says, "Well, hope they hurry because I'm getting married tomorrow." I say, "What did you say?" He realizes he's blown it. He makes something else up and I say, "No, you said getting married tomorrow." I swing open the screen door. He looks at me like a naughty boy and steps out. "Sure you won't change your mind," he wheedles. I say sadly, "No." I really would like to make love to him but, oh, well. He blew it. (531 words)

I'm pumping iron and decide to up the weights to 50 pounds. I hold in each hand a huge, thick weight. It is almost too much. It is difficult to do curl-ups and then I notice I am making it to 20 or so reps, which is impressive. I am slim and fit-looking in my spandex leotard outfit. I try to go down a flight of stairs with the weights in my hand and nearly fall down the stairs as my balance is not used to the added weight. (89 words)

I've moved into a place. I notice that we only brought the furniture this time and the move is much easier because I left behind all those boxes of papers and my writings. Dwight and I are talking about what we're going to be. I say, "I wanted to be an artist and I wanted to be a writer but it's not going to happen. I used to be a counselor and a teacher but I can't do that anymore because of my arthritis," (and I feel a bit guilty about that because I know that's not completely true). I feel like I'm drifting. I don't know what I want to do. Dwight is hungry and opens up a cupboard where I'd cooked left-over lunch, taco pizza. It looks pretty gross, but he eats it anyway. Now, I'm trying to run a writer's group, with Aunt Elaine and some young cousins, maybe Uncle Lionel. I can't get them to get settled down. They wander around and giggle and talk and interrupt and leave and come back. Finally in exasperation I say, "This is like teaching kindergarten kids!" They are sympathetic and try to come to order. Suddenly, I see a huge plastic air-filled duck drop down, like in Mace's parade balloon. It falls into the hedge near the windowed wall. I am amazed and go over, thinking suddenly, "Maybe there's someone in it. Maybe it's an alien from outer space." I get closer and see that there is something in it, eight babies. I say, "Someone call 911 and get the police...no, the medical people first, to take a look at those babies!" Someone goes to call. We wait and wait. It's taking them far too long and we get suspicious they've sent for the military. I say, "There's no way I'll let the military guys come in here first without making sure the babies are all right." A man now comes in a navy uniform, only it's a captain of the work crew that's been building the submarine complex out in the bay or ocean right outside the windows. Someone had called him about the duck, Murphy Salvage, or something. I explain we're first waiting for the hospital people. I put in another call. They are cold, distant and confused. Now I'm alarmed they are up to something. The Captain pulls me aside to talk. I say to him, "Too bad your sub isn't ready yet," because I know he's just recently sent up a work crew to rest or something and it was empty. He says, "Well, it is working, technically. A few men are down there. It's almost ready for its shake-down cruise." I look at him, wondering if we could hide down there. He then smiles at me and begins to say something like, "I've always liked you but somebody had to do or say something to let the other know they're interested." I look at him surprised. He then leaps off the table he's sitting on and gently but insistently pushes me up against the windowed wall, where outside the waters are churning turbulently. He kisses me. I am aware that it's an OK kiss but not really exciting and he's OK looking but not all that handsome. I think, "He has tufts of hair in his ears and a bit of a paunchy belly." After the kiss, I say to him, "Well, I never even thought of this as a possibility before." I pause as he waits, thinking over my feelings, and then I say, "I'm willing to 'work at' the possibility and see what happens." (I use an academic word that starts with "A" for "work at.") He is very happy. He has a chance. We are all going to hide the duck on his sub and he will court me in those rough waters. (642 words)

I am marrying a man. We are sweet on each other. His mom finds out and is very jealous and pushes me away. She doesn't want me near her boy. I watch, as the story unfolds that for years she's been abusing him in horrible, torturing ways, handcuffing him to the wrong place on a trailer and then driving, him being drug on the dirt road, the wheels just barely missing running over him. He cries and begs for her to stop, but she just laughs crazy like Sybil's mom. Finally, the pain of being drug is so bad he tries to get himself situated so that when the handcuffs release, he's in the path of the wheels and he'd be run over, killed, and put out of his misery. I feel painful empathy for him. Now she's in a house telling him to get ready for bed, she's got his medicine ready for him. She goes into the bathroom and pees and has a bowel movement into the water and then she's going to put it in his medicine. I am repulsed by what I see. She sees me watching and screams at me to get out. "Get out." Now there's a dad too, a retired military man who works at a boy's school. (He describes how careful you have to be and not be in the bathroom with a boy alone.) He's usually gone, but occasionally comes home and has violent sex with her and with a woman friend of mine. The dad and mom love/hate each other very much. He has some white cream in a tube he puts in her vagina or on his penis. He wants her to eat some. She refuses. I take a small bit into my mouth, like being nice and helping him to feel better and not rejected. My woman friend also takes a taste on her tongue. Then he says, quite chattily, that he's had syphilis for 20 years. He starts to describe the symptoms. I am sick and ask permission, "If you don't mind, I'd like to rinse out my mouth." I try to rinse and spit to get it all out. It's a bit foamy now like shaving cream. I hope I got it all out before I swallowed any so I don't get diseased. Now some fat secretary woman is describing how he'd lock her in the bathroom, her in her black slip, and take a whip. (He'd be in full military uniform. I'm amazed because I thought he was just a psycho security guard or something, but it's a real military uniform.) "He cracks a mean whip," says the woman, "and it really hurts." I feel the pain on my butt in sympathy of her real pain. I flinch. This is a sick and crazy man. Then he insists I make love to him and twists my nipples to stimulate me. I feel sexual excitement and do it. (492 words)

Derek is painting pictures of mountains. I am trying to paint one too. I have my palette and see a sort of yellowish color up in the right hand corner, an odd color for the sky. Derek starts to dabble in my colors and I ask him not to. I then awkwardly attempt to paint. I draw a steep-peaked mountain and remember what my father said about how mountains aren't really that steep. I redraw it in softer curves. I discover how leaving some portions of the canvas blank and using that whiteness as a part of the picture enhances the picture. I create many different mountain ranges with some kind of building structure in the left corner foreground. It's pretty good. [BL] (122 words)

I go to a dating service and see the video of a man named Jim. I am very attracted to him and know that he's the one I want. I make a video of me. I say, "This is what I look like. You can see I'm in a chair, and older and plump." Then I squirrel around in my wheelchair, showing him my energy and personality. I hope he'll accept me. He does, and we set up a first date. I am excited and a little scared. I know this is so right, I am looking forward to it. He comes to my hotel/apartment. I meet him in the lobby wearing a yellow satin prom dress kind of thing. It is awkward and OK. (125 words)

I am driving a car and am following a truck. I see that it is a flatbed truck and a couple of horses are on it. And as I watch, the horses have loosened themselves from their stalls and are slowly drifting or sliding over to the back edge. They are going to fall off and hit the road and I'll be killed and so will they. I slam on my brakes to get some distance between the upcoming accident and me. As a result, an eight-car collision occurs. Now we are stopped, and on the side of the road. I am dazed. I look into the rear view mirror and see the cars all smooshed up, fender to fender. Everyone seems unhurt but angry. One of them marches up to my driver's side door, which is open, and starts to lecture me on being more careful. I am furious and tell him off, explaining that I probably saved our lives by doing it this way. Now another man comes up and asks me if I'm all right. He's very friendly and seems gentle and on my side. I suddenly get suspicious as he gets into the passenger side, that he is a doctor. He agrees. He is a doctor. That pisses me off because I hate it when some one is kind and caring because it's their profession or it is in general for everybody. I want that to be for me. He is suggesting we drive to the hospital. I ask if they (the police) are done with us, and then I am driving away, assuming that they are. I am flirting gently with the doctor. We drive to his house. He is married and has kids and yet it is clear he likes me very much. He says, "Can you manage to go over there?" "Where?" I ask. "To the barn." I go there, wondering what this is all about, and trusting it. He has a one-horse sleigh and we're going to take a ride. It is sweet and romantic. He helps me in and wraps a warm black fur blanket around me tightly, like you'd tuck in a blanket around a baby. I smile and then get worried he's pinning me down, my arms, and I'll be taken advantage of. But I calm down and trust him. He shows me there really is a horse in the barn, meaning we'll really go for a ride. I ask how we can do that with no snow on the ground, and he says it has special wheels on the skids. Now his teen boys come in and are very curious about who I am and why I'm here. They seem to understand that their father loves me and it's OK with them because they want their father to be happy. It is gentle and soft. (477 words)

I am watching a young man who was a star athlete in high school. He's graduated now and doesn't know what to do. He's a nobody now. So he returns to high school to hang out and becomes a delinquent. He plays mean tricks on people and is insolent. A woman teacher (dark hair) is walking down the sidewalk. It's lunch break. The boy says to his cohort, "Hey, I'll pay you 75 cents to moon her with me." The other boy says, "Nah." The boy takes a pair of scissors and snips off a bit of his hair. He says, "OK, then a buck." "Nah," says the other boy as he snips off another bit of hair. The other boy says, "For 1.50, I'll do it." The boy is upset it is so much. He must be losing his control, but he agrees. So as the teacher walks past them, they pull down their pants. Her first initial automatic response is to gasp and get angry and righteous, but she realizes this is exactly what they want and so she just says, "Huh," like she's bored and walks on. She's quite please she figured out how to let the air out of their balloons! She is very upset and thinking hard, because she's on probation. She has stood up to a student (male) and people are upset with her. It isn't fair. As she walks, she sees an orange and white cat who she wants to pet. She stoops down to pet it and it loves being petted, laying down on it's side and purring as the teacher strokes its soft and sometimes matted fur. Suddenly she looks at her watch. It's 1 o'clock; she's late. She turns back and walks toward the school. She notices the houses on the left. One is a single room, empty, pretty, but too small. It has a step, but on the side is a ramp. "Good," thinks the teacher. The houses are older and nice. She now either recalls or receives a phone call from the mother of the male student who she stood up to. The mother is nasty and mean. She is saying that the teacher just isn't understanding enough. She misunderstood the student's intentions. Did he speak to you in a mean way? She sneers like that is going to prove the teacher wrong. The teacher tells her it's the mother's fault and this annoys the mother very much. She makes a sarcastic remark, thinking she has proven her point that she is right and the teacher is wrong and hangs up. She leaves her room as her husband is entering it. The husband says, "How are you?" She grumps, "Yep," well satisfied with herself. The husband shrugs and ignores her. Now the teacher is nearly to the school and decides to go in the side door and hopefully avoid the main office. She hopes that there was a fire drill so her lateness will not be noticed. She sees that along the wall of the high school are displays of different breakfast cereals: Wheaties, Cheerios, Men's____ (like study group) and on the left side of the sidewalk is a stack of cereals called "Misjudgments. 50 ways to count."

I am vacationing on Hawaii. I look forward to the beauty. but things keep going wrong: the wrong bus, we get stalled, we can't find the place. I discover it's just a tourist trap. Finally I leave and then decide to return, thinking I can find some small corner near the beach where I can enjoy the ocean and surf and beach. I know I made the wrong decision, but I do it anyway. I find a rundown neighborhood. The tourist fancy buildings are off on the horizon, but I can't find the ocean. (94 words)

I am being encouraged to go to a river and cross the bridge so I can get a good look at the river. I come to the river's edge and look down. It is full of brown water and strong currents. I don't want to cross the bridge and look at the river. I see cars driving in the river and wonder how they can breathe in there, because the car looks like it is under the water. I look more closely and see the water is only up to their necks. Close enough, I think. I decide to go away from the river. I am going against traffic. It is hard and slow. I round a corner and see a glimpse of the ocean where the river runs into it. The waves are huge and white and foamy as they crash against the rocks. I want to go down on the beach. A man also wants to go there and we sort of go together. Now we are on the beach. We pass a room where it's a sort of a glassed-in museum and a 95-year-old grandma is inside telling the visitors whatever they want to know about the things in there. I am curious and sign up for my turn to go in. Now I have my girls and a young college age girl as part of my party to go in and see the woman. The man and I are friends now. As we wait, the woman, now an older spiritual guru type woman, comes in flustered and says somewhat shortly at her male partner/business manager/lover, "You're not sending in the right kind. I want only the ones that are willing to work." I feel a bit concerned. I sort of want to work and yet I am not completely trusting that she isn't just some fake guru and will lead me astray, and I'll be sincerely working only down the wrong path. Now she's ready for us and he calls us to come quickly for our time with her. I call out to the girls who are scattered by now. The man and I go sit down on the floor right in front of the couch barrier in front of her. I accidentally knock off a few unset gems (jewels) that were scattered across the top of the couch-like barrier as I try to get down on the floor. Now the man and I cuddle, my back into his front as I lean back into his comforting presence. She won't work with us until we are relaxed, deeply asleep and open. I am almost there, I am warmly asleep and yet I am fighting it. I don't know how to get to that feeling place I have to get to for her to do her work. The harder I try, the more awake I become. Now the session is over and we stumble back out to the beach, sleepy and yet we need to drive back home. The man and I will share driving one car and the girls will share driving another. We'll take turns when the other gets sleepy. The college student girl is concerned. She needs more information, but the woman is gone now. I say, "Well, we have her business card. Here's her phone number, but I think it will probably not work because she probably lives way out in the coast range and will be inaccessible to us." I try to encourage the girl to let go of needing the answer and come home to rest. (595 words)

Robert Redford has been out drinking. He comes in late at night and I am already in the hide-a-bed. I am not asleep, but pretend to be. He stumbles in and decides to lay down by me on the bed. He is married, but we are attracted to each other. He lays down across my belly, mumbling to himself. I feel him begin to have an erection. He is sexually excited about being close to me. He is upset with himself for feeling this. "Damn," he mumbles. "Usually, when this happens, I dance. But maybe she doesn't want me to dance. I don't have any idea. I don't have any idea. I don't have any idea." He is whispering to himself and then he curls up around me and gently, softly kisses my shoulder, chest area. Then he begins to gently kiss the chin bone and jaw, moving up to the lips, and I am consumed with a raging, pleasurable sexual desire. I wake up startled, like I'd somehow bailed out too soon, out of automatic response. (177 words)

[I go back to sleep quickly and fall into the same dream,] only now, my mother is there asking me how come I didn't make love to him. He's so adorable, sweet and handsome, irresistible. I say somewhat stuffily, "That it was against my principles because he is a married man." (39 words)

I am in a car with a mentally retarded man. He is driving. I feel wild and spontaneous and I dare him to drive across the Golden Gate bridge. He does and the more dangerous he gets in his nonawareness, the more I like it. I encourage it. We go across lanes, spin around doing 360's and so on. Later, I order him around telling him to go get the car. He finds it where he crashed it in a field, and sees a round, gashed-out dent in the rear fender area. He opens the door and sees a young preteen girl who is cute, with long bushy hair. She is the woman's younger self. She's not so wild, simply alert and open and fun-loving, a healthier version. I then see the puppy of the dog that goes with the woman, also innocent, frisky and cute. Now the teen woman decides to go steady with the mentally retarded man. The ritual is to get a special going steady kit which is used to clasp the 2-inch wide band of yellow plastic webbing around the wrist. After it is fastened, her mom comes out and is very concerned, not asking directly, for fear of riling up the teen woman, but still worried she's making a mistake. (215 words)

I am in a house like the M City house. I've decided to do a Shakespeare play and Ellie is going to direct it. We are going over the script. I say that already many excellent actors are letting me know they're interested in being in it. It's going to be a very good play (I had typed I'm going to be a very good play by accident). I see myself seated to Ellie's right watching a rehearsal and getting a great idea for a particular bit of business that will be humorous, a special B touch that leaves my signature on the play. I go over to Ellie giggling, and say, "I've had a dynamite idea." I sense the actors on stage are very curious to see if I, the Mom, will simply override Ellie and make her do my idea, or if indeed Ellie is the REAL director. I think, "I hope I can let go if she doesn't agree." I can't wait to do the play. It will be such fun. Some woman notices (back at the M City house) some of the students' papers from class have drawings on them. I chuckle and say, "Yes, here I was all excited about reading the script and I asked them to hand in their papers, because I wanted to get out of there in a hurry, and one then says, "Oh, I have to make a cover," and proceeds to draw a cover with crayons. I sigh, and then laugh, and then say, "I really want to honor that style." Then a young woman comes up and talks about how she doesn't understand Shakespeare, or she doesn't know how to write it, and I suggest she draw it. (290 words)

I am living in the old M City House. The recreation room has been remodeled to my bedroom. I am moving things in and organizing the drawers. I look out the open door and see a giant man with no head walking with ponderous steps backwards. I am a bit afraid of him and remind myself to not get in his way. A man now comes to the door and I see that behind him is a huge buffalo. I try to shut and lock the door against him but he forces his way in anyway. I am also a bit afraid of him. He asks if I have any spark plugs. I say, "No I don't, but I'll ask my father. He's outside. You ask him." He goes out. Now, I see my bookcase outside the window with tall large books in it. Dwight then comes in and says he has a room off of my room. I see a door and go look in. My bookcase is in his room. His room is very small. He says it's OK to keep the bookcase in the little corner of his room. The giant man walks by again, only this time he has his head and is attempting to walk forward. Now, a man and a woman are talking. This is supposed to be a meeting I am involved in with another person, but they take over and I'm so tired, I let them. Finally I say, "Look, let's stop this meeting because you two aren't including us and I'm too tired now to change it." I say, "Let's set a time to meet next." The man says, "No, we can do that later." I say "No, it's easier for me to do it now because we're all here together; otherwise, I'd have to call and recall everybody." Now we have to find a calendar. No matter where we look, we can't find one. I open drawers and take out old wallets from long ago, noticing I'd left in small change. I am messing up the organization I'd so recently spent time fixing. There are lots of wallets and no calendar. I am very tired and sleepy and give up. (370 words)

I am on an island and the enemy (Japan) is looking it over to see if anyone is there. I am concerned and tell Ernie and the boys to stay in the shadows and avoid the light. That way, they'll not know we're here and maybe the war won't start. We get in the light anyway, and now we're informed the war will start at noon on Monday. I am trying to get to a safe place. Others are as well. An Asian woman is rushing up the mountainside. Now I'm in a group of people. In fact, I'm at the head of a marching group and I realize I'm in the army. A nasty DI sergeant is harassing me. "Keep up! Do it right!" I'm falling a bit behind. I want to be in the lead, but I don't want all this army stuff. "Turn right," he screams. We pause. A presidential flag ceremony is going on. "Should we go over and honor that?" "No," he yells. "It's a decoy. We're needed at the front." Now an announcer man with a microphone is going to the edge of the front. He's saying he'll probably be the first one shot in the war. Musicians are racing toward the front for the beginning of the war ceremony. Now there are crowds. The disabled group can't be found. I see the one on the other side getting organized. "Oh, oh. Where's Ellie and Charla?" I go looking. The DI finds me and says horrible things. I'm pissed and pull back my fist. I'm about to hit him in the face. He's grinning, "Yeah. Make my day. Hit me, you putz. Were you just going to hit me? That's assault of an officer...etc." I back down because he can make serious trouble for me. I see Mirabelle. She returned early from New Zealand because of the war. We hug. She cries. She's afraid; so am I. I'm frantic to find Ellie and Charla. Then I find them, laying down and waiting. I go to them. I see my black, furry pouch. Thank God. It had been stolen and here it was. I grab up my things and then realize the good credit cards and the driver's license, the money and car keys are gone. We're on the brink of war and I have NO ID, no identity. I scramble around and find Bonnie at a counter. I'm asking how I get my ID copied. I can't be without my ID at this crucial moment. She tells me some things to do. (428 words)

I am in a wheelchair and now have a small Volkswagen bug. I have had the front driver's seat removed and am trying to position my power wheelchair there. Now I want to remodel the chair. Why can't it be compact? New technology in batteries can make that part small and lightweight. It can be like a regular chair with small wheels and a tiny foot pedal thing. I go to a place and try to get them to build it for me. There are problems, but slowly the chair is built. (92 words)

I am in a house in the mountains. I am a comedy writer and I'm helping a man friend of mine be a comedy writer. We are free associating and brainstorming. Now, someone looks out the window and sees a stick of lightning and I wonder if the storm is coming close. It is. I see a thick funnel cloud develop on the ground. The top poofs out powerfully and it's a twister. The man is intrigued. He wants to know more. "OK," says another man, "but look out." The storm maker, a pixie-like man, comes out of the storm. It had traveled over to our hay mow. He offers the comedy writing man, now the father, a ride. He takes it. This is magic time. Off they go on the thunderous, rolling cloud, a muddy brown color. Now I am alone in the house, with a couple of grown sisters and a brother. They are off doing something. I see outside the storm has brought birds and animals made out of ice. An ice turkey buzzard comes into the house. He's mean and tries to peck things. I light a match and try to melt him. It's a very puny effort, but it does force him outside. I see a sweet ice puppy and try to melt it. It likes it. I feel bad about doing it. I go in and then see the tiny baby kitten. One has gone outside. I don't want to go out, but I do to rescue the kitten. It is fat and cute. I get it and run back in the house. The sisters and brother are back and I yell, "Quick, shut the door!" I yell that over and over as they are slow and unconcerned. My father is on the phone asking how we are and I'm telling him what's happening. Then we're all back in the house. One sister is an architect, another is some other important professional, and the brother is too. They are working on the problem. The architect asks for a computer file on LaCisine or something, a famous architect. This research might give her enough historical background to solve this problem. (365 words)

I am in a room, perhaps "my" room. It is my birthday. Two people sit on the couch. A Reynold-like man is seated on the floor across from me. I am in an easy chair. A woman is at my right. Derek/man is seated in the easy chair with me at my left. I can't really see him. I just sense his closeness. I am shy and afraid to look at him because I love him and he doesn't love me. Reynold puts on one of my hats with silk red flowers on it. He's laughing and looking silly. I smile, the hat starts to break up and a string of those red flowers goes from the hat toward me. It seems symbolic. There is an amazing abundance of those flowers. I am surprised. I only remembered two of them. Derek/man says to me -- I see him how seated a short ways from me on my left -- he says, "Just now, when I said this, what did you feel?" I look at him and smile gently and answer truthfully from the heart what I felt. Then I distract myself and pick up a small computer toy game. I idly start to fiddle with it, actually thinking of playing it while I sit here at my birthday party. Then Derek starts softly singing a sweet love song in an Elvis Presley type voice. It is something about I love you, but you don't know it. I feel such love for you, etc. I sigh and am touched and keep my face shyly averted from him because it is too heartbreaking to hear him say those words, knowing they aren't for me. A mentally retarded woman is standing to my right and she is saying something and I turn toward her slightly and listen, not wanting her to interrupt and letting her interrupt. She says she's leaving. I say goodbye. I notice a thick layer of dust on the computer games on the table to my right. He slowly moves around until he is more facing me and so close. I look up and he is in a kissing position. His eyes are filled with love and his voice soft and sexy. He kisses me tenderly and lovingly. I melt into it shyly. I am so happy. He does mean those words for me. Then he whispers, "But look at the dates! The 9th, the 22nd and now the 26th!!" (cousin Lenny's birthday, his birthday and our day of falling in love together). He says, "I've known you for a while, but I just fell in love with you two minutes ago." I reach over and kiss him again, being careful to make it a short kiss so he won't think I'm trying to be demanding or sexual. He asks me how I feel right this minute. I say, huskily, "Good. A minute ago, I felt bad and sad. And in a few minutes I will again. But right this moment, I feel good." I am flooded with a rising tide of loving feelings. I am suffused with love and sweetness and tenderness. (523 words)

I am on a committee. A radical malcontent is on the committee and some conservative women. I am helping facilitate, trying to hear and working with and honor both sides. I am getting annoyed at the radical. He's kind of into his anger and not really ready to work through stuff. I am in love with this man. I go visit his place. I'm talking to him about the committee. I am laying on his bed, on top of the blue and white coverlet. Some young woman is there, maybe his daughter. It is innocent and loving. He and I are interested in relationship but are shy and concerned. We are flirting and courting and getting serious. Now it's time for another meeting. the big meeting. I go there; the man is coming a bit later. I get some info out of a drawer, some pictures of athletes as possible evidence. I get to the room; I'm a bit late. They say, "Oh, here, in here." I go in and the table is round and most everyone is already seated. I go around to the other side of the table and find a place to slide in. I'm wearing a dress and sit on the floor. I know that's A MISTAKE. It'll be uncomfortable soon. My man friend comes in and is nervous. He doesn't like committees and meetings, but he's willing to help out. I am seated between a suave, good-looking, vain man and his mother. They are gossiping about women and who he's dated. He sees a name (c:\sherial) on a car and takes it down. He'll call her,;maybe he already had a night with her, he can't remember. Now it's time for my man friend to start the meeting. He's going to sing and dance. He's wearing a woman's tap dance outfit and silly lipstick and wig. He taps and sings beautifully. He's built like Archie. I am smiling at him and winking encouragement. I think he's terrific. The good-looking man gets jealous and tries to grab me and kiss me. I slap him across the face just as my guy is tap dancing around to our side of the table. I know the suave man did that to get my guy jealous so he'd lose his step and ruin the presentation. My guy grabs me and dances with me like its part of the routine. He says, "What's going on?" I say, "Nothing, nothing. Don't worry about it. He just made a pass." He gets jealous and I insist he dance on. He finishes the dance. The suave guy says to me, "What do you see in him?" I say, "He's so talented and interesting and hey, he's got great boobies" (meaning the fake ones he's wearing). "Besides," I say, "you are boring. All you talked about for a half hour was gossip. He's got depth." (480 words)

I go over to a man's house. I am very interested in this man. He comes over to me and says, "Hey, nice to see you, but I'm taking off with the guys. We're going hunting. If you're still here when I get back, we'll get together, OK?" I have this internal feeling that yeah, I intend to be here. I'm going to stick it out as long as it takes. I also realize he's teasing me a bit, knowing I want to be with him and just selfishly taking off. He's rubbing my face in it a bit. I hang out. Later he returns and I am sitting on a couch and he sits next to me. I am aware that he is crazy, and I know I'm being accepted into the "inner sanctum" of his intimates. The phone rings. I answer it and it's for me. Some woman asks for Jiving Joe, and asks me how "the Ladies" went. She meant my Play, "Ladies mayhemming society" and how the rehearsals went, or the performance, I'm not sure which. She's an intimate friend of the man's and is semi-teasing me as well. Now I am leaving, maybe I'm a half-grown boy. The man is crazy and potentially dangerous. He sends a horse after me, to hurt me. I run and hide in a small room and the lock on the door is broken. I try and try to get it to lock. It won't. It's too late to go out and find another place to hide. So I see a smaller room, a closet and get into it. It has a working lock. I notice behind me a smaller enclosure, maybe a utility box that I could squeeze into if I have to. I choose not to for the moment. (301 words)

I see a young teen boy (maybe 17 years old) on a raft in the ocean. He and his animal friends are on a mission, like Johnny Appleseed. There is a dog, a beaver, and other animals, including 87 baby tarantulas. When he began this journey, there had been only one adult. Even though he is a virgin and doesn't know how to make love himself, his job is to find the ducks and help them have sex so they will have baby ducks. I see many little baby ducks swimming around. He helps the female ducks sit on the male duck in the right position so the deed gets done. I know this because a male narrator voice is telling these facts as I see the picture. Now the scene changes and I am talking to a woman. She confesses she had another baby boy after Melvin. Although the woman would be Valerie, logically, it is Ginny. I now get to meet the long lost boy, who is an innocent young teen (as above). He has bright red hair. His name is Douglas. I say, "It's so nice to meet Melvin's half brother." He looks surprised and says, "Half"? I look over at Ginny. "Haven't you told him?" "Sorry." So they talk. I say to him, "I am called Auntie. I am like your Auntie." He formally says, "Hello, Auntie." I invite him to hug me. He does, but it's a bit stiff. Then he melts into a more natural hug. [BL] (252 words)

There is a doctor, then John Laroquette, like Barry S, a doctor-type, and me, a nurse, and we are supposed to work together. The doctor leaves and John is coaxing me to stay and work with him. He loves me and wants me. I am attracted, but he is presuming too much. He has his arm around my waist saying, "And after we have a nice romantic dinner, we can relax and make love all night." I get haughty and say, "Oh, you think so, huh?" Now Fluffy is in my lap and I'm so glad to see her. I pet her and we are happy. Now I see Bitsy Cat is here too. I am surprised, but then I notice she has huge chunks of naked skin where clumps of fur is missing and blood spots. She's injured. I must help her and ask John to help me. He gets a can of antiseptic spray stuff and I try to hold her and spray and now John and I are doing it together and somehow we are laying down together while we are trying to fix the wound on Bitsy Cat.

I am in my wheelchair and so is Derek. We are seated outside a house, where inside are some of my relatives. Derek is holding a baby girl and I am holding a baby boy. We are not speaking because I am hurt and angry at him. My baby boy squirms and fusses and I move him around until I have him seated on my lap facing me and I cuddle him. He settles down contentedly. It's soft and loving. Then my mother comes out and says, "It's time for the presentation." I am annoyed because I want to stay with this warm, loving feeling with the baby. I then hand the baby to a woman and wheel inside. I see a huge room, where many people are seated around in a circle, on ritzy couches and fancy chairs. I look for a good place to put myself so I can see everyone and they can see me. Derek is now on one of the couches. I avoid him, taking great pains to snub him and not give him eye contact. I chose the head of the room, by the huge fireplace. There is also a skeet shoot apparatus up on the wall to my left. Derek encourages the rich man who lives in this mansion to shoot the birdie. He tries a couple of times, but it is all weak and ineffective. A silly coo-coo type mechanical bird flaps his wings, and a sort of pop gun goes off. Now I begin my lecture. I want to keep it informal and answer questions. The topic is dreams. I say, "I know lots of things about dreams and my bias is Jungian, but I don't want to inundate you with all this. Just ask me what you want to know and I'll try to answer it." I am watching the words I use so I don't trigger Derek's automatic responses around 'know-it-all left brain language." Some ask some questions and it goes on. Now it's over and a man, like Richie, Kyle's brother, also a rich man from this mansion, is seated on my right. He is telling me how much he has wanted to meet me because he'd seen pictures of me and I'm fabulous and he loves me and would like to have s-e-x with me. And he goes on like a star-struck fan. I say to him, angry and bitter, "I am 51 years old. You are young. This is stupid and won't work." He ignores me and prattles on and on, very gushy and intense. I want to leave now. Derek is nearby watching. Now I'm on a couch and a bookshelf contraption slides in front of "Walter" and myself to give us some privacy. I want to leave. He grabs me and tries to kiss me. I fight and scream, "Leave me alone, no no!" I break from his grasp, and I see Derek is frantically getting into his chair to come beat up Walter and protect me. I am sobbing violently and deeply. I drive away in my chair to the van and Derek follows. I am screaming, crying and he won't leave me alone. He hangs onto my handles and hitches a ride with me; he is concerned and loving. I am deeply hurt and sad. This Walter, who I don't like and don't want, wants me. Derek, who I love and want, won't have me. It has been this way all my life. It's not fair. I sob and sob, a deep grieving. (591 words)

I make a joke to a woman that I really did a good job with turning on the radio program, when it is a totally automatic job at the radio station. I am in a huge warehouse kind of building. I walk away from her to go to my "room." I turn back around and notice that the van, which I thought I had parked near a wall, had been moved over to another position, AND the vandals had taken off a wheel, stripped off hub cabs and mirrors and so on, which are laying on the "ground"/floor. A spray of water is spurting up from a rupture in the "ground/floor" like a pipe had been broken in the violent dismemberment of my van. I wonder if I should leave there. Maybe I'm in danger.

I am being pursued by two men who wish to marry me. I am taking my time, choosing which one is the right one for me. One man is dark-haired and nice, but not exciting and gorgeous. I am attracted, but not all that interested. I am thinking of rejecting him. I see a house near the ocean where the side yard literally is the ocean. The children of the family are swimming in it and playing on the rocks in the water. It seems so convenient and wonderful. I feel a bit envious. A young 12- or 13-year-old girl is in the water and someone asks her if they can look at her nose, because she'd had plastic surgery done on it. She is annoyed at their curiosity. Now I see the man I had rejected in the front seat of a car. The passenger side is open and I go to speak to him, to be comforting, as he is hurting from the rejections. A young girl, maybe the same one, comes up and wants to hug him and I hold her off, thinking it would be too teasing, as he can't have what he wants. Now his mother drives up and gets out, walking over to us. I say to him, hanging on to him so he won't run, "Here's your mother." I want him to face her. He feels very rejected and hurt by his mother. She is pretty, with bleached blonde hair and young-looking, but she is older, with wrinkles when you look closer. She's very egotistical and self-centered. She has a dress in her hand, one I used to wear, and is offering to sell it to me. I lay it out across him and me to look at it. He is sort of half laying, half sitting on the seat, diagonal, so his feet are toward the open door. I am seated on the edge of the front seat, facing the back seat, sort of. She points out the beaded strands and the young girl is looking closely at the weave so she can make one like it. I decide to defend the man and I grab her, the mother, and the dress and I am marching her back to her car. I start beating her up with the beaded dress, now big wooden beads, and it hurts her. It's like I'm flogging her. I am angry and selfrighteous. She abandoned the man as a boy and she has no business or right hurting him now. I drag her to her pickup truck and make her drive away. Now the scene shifts and I am married to the man. I had seen the errors of my ways and am being caring and committed to him. We run an inn or a restaurant and I have an apron on, I have dark hair and I am saying, "I need to take my husband his dessert now." I am very loving to him and so happy I had seen my mistake and changed. I had almost made a bad decision when I first chose not to marry him. (523 words)

I am in a hospital bed. I am asleep and Dwight comes to my bedside. He is very drunk. I pretend to stay asleep as he tries to talk to me. His drinking buddies try to get him to leave me alone. Finally, he goes to another area. Now I'm playing a violin. I'm playing Christmas carols, "Away in the Manger," and "Oh, Holy Night." At first, it is a bit difficult because of my fingers, then as I continue and practice, I get better and better, not even trying to find the right note, just flinging my fingers and they hit the exact right spot and the most beautiful music comes out. It's sweet violin music. Now a group of interns and the doctor come and surround me on the bed. They are poking and talking and I demand that they stop. I say, "Stop this. Tell me what is going on." They ignore me and I get more insistent and loud. Finally, I get the attention of the doctor, a haughty man, who condescends to listen to me for a moment. I explain how demeaning it is to be ignored. It is my body and I have a right to know what is going on. Now that I got their attention, I let them do the tests, which ends up like a kind of surgery. They make a mistake and I am permanently brain damaged. I am innocent and pliable. Someone decides to marry me because I have great wealth and they want it for themselves. An older man and his son are arguing who will be my groom. I am on the arm of the father. I wear a beautiful, white bridal dress. I vacantly smile and I'm serene. Even though I have some consciousness, maybe my dream self feels worried I'll be hurt and taken advantage of. We are in a vehicle, where I and the two men are in the backseat. The father is on my left and the son is across facing me. I look out the window and see buildings and then see the hospital I had been in and get upset and don't want to see it. I get agitated. Now we are at the place the wedding will take place in. It's a big room. The dancing starts as I sit alone for a moment on a bench. I see three women decide to dance together to start the dancing. They do back flips and strange moves like that. They wear long dresses that are pretty, vibrant and sexy. A man asks his wife to dance and she says, "Not now, here let ____ substitute." It is a boy. The man and the boy dance. I decide I have to go to the bathroom. I get up and wander away. The dream conscious one knows I'll escape this way by getting lost and they can't find me, but the bride doesn't know anything. I go around the back around a building like a grown-over path through an old orchard of trees. I find the shit house, which is filthy and full of shit. I am disgusted by the idea of my white pristine dress being besmirched by all this shit. I go further and see a gate. It's an old wooden one. I open it and go inside. It is a dog kennel. There are lots of large, black dogs, maybe Labradors are being bred there, or housed there. I stand looking. Some men are at the far end. One man -- ugly, large, and mean -- has a double gauge shotgun. He begins to threaten me by pointing it at me and then begins to fire. Bullets hit the wall behind me very close. I am in danger and yet I am still very serene. I wait patiently with just a bit of alarm. Some men try to tell him not to shoot me. He fires the gun at them too, narrowly missing them. Now a beautiful hunk, the hero, in a tan leather jacket, good-looking and capable, comes around the corner. The dream consciousness knows he's the one that will rescue me and I will end up marrying him. He stops the mean guy from shooting at me and the dream fades out, with the dream consciousness knowing it will be a happy ending. (725 words)

I am in a car with Bonnie. We are taking the back road. It is a side road which is parallel to the big freeways. It is scenic, there's hardly any traffic and so it's easier to drive on and I get places faster and more refreshed. We come up to a stop sign where the freeway intersects. Now the car is a small airplane. Jock and another man are in it with me and I say, "Shall I fly the plane?" The man, who is at the driver's wheel, starts giving excuses like it will cost 1.15.7 per gallon for the gas and we'd have to go clear over to the gas station, and so on. I say to Jock, "So, are you afraid of flying?" He says, "No, but I know he is." I realize I'm a bit afraid of doing it myself. If I got up there, how would I find this little patch of home to land in again? What if we fell? Now I go into the house and realize it's different. I liked the other house, the one I had before this, better. There are many rooms and so on, but the other house was more spacious and simple, Danish-like in style. There's baby girl and an older girl. They want their bottle. The men want to feed the babies. Where are the bottles? Howard's in there somewhere. (234 words)

The girls are going to be visiting and I am talking on the phone with Howard's third wife. As we are talking, we are constantly interrupted with noisy situations. At first I am out in the fields, green bean fields, and the crews and trucks are too noisy, so I retreat back into the house, which is spacious and huge. There are several hundred Boy Scouts there, and their parents are coming to pick them up in long train cars, like a zoo train. I retreat further and go down to a laundry room, where a mother of a girl who had been visiting comes to get her girl. We go into the next room, where miles of clothes hang on racks in this opulent closet. Even the visiting girl has a rack of her own. The mother is showing me her cute outfits. I admire them. I move down to another level and I am outdoors in a park-like setting with trees. I look up into the sky and there are flying giant pop bottles and other huge debris flying. I realize I'm so far below the earth level that it appears to be flying above me. I also realize that gravity is working and some of these things are falling down. I look for a safe place to sit. I decide to sit under a fir tree so the branches will protect me. I'm still talking to Howard's third wife. Now I go down another level and find a huge shower room and around the corner a luscious bathtub, rich and expansive. I decide I can get into this tub because there is a ramp-like thing which goes up to it so I can use my knees and get up and down. Dovre is there. I ask Howard's wife if Howard is drinking more, as she is telling me hew has disappeared and is more miserable. Yes, he has a drinking problem. I offer to let them stay in my huge house when they come with the girls for a day or so. I say, "Do you want me to get you a motel room? or will you schedule it? or you can even stay here, if you want." I feel generous. (374 words)

I enter a room, like a store, and Derek/Darryl is there in his wheelchair. I am shy and don't give him much eye contact and connection, even though I love him. Someone is narrating something about how the one who loves and stays learns more and is richer than the one who leaves. It's sort of my thoughts I am directing toward him. I want him to stay and love and learn. He finishes his shopping and rolls out the door. I say wistfully, "Goodbye Derek." He tosses a curt, distant goodbye over his shoulder as he leaves. Now I go into another room, with maybe clothes, maybe Katrina is in there. Now I am in a shopping mall area and see a sweet 6-month-old baby girl in an open store area. I am very happy to see her. She is so cute, innocent, fresh and happy and sweet. I hold her in my lap and am talking to her. I realize she's being sexually abused and I am telling her with empathy that she will have years of hard work ahead of her to learn forgiveness. Her parents are in the store and neglectful. They aren't paying any attention to her. I want to interfere, but know I can't. The girl baby will have to be unprotected and go through this awful pain and she will eventually prevail. There is a dog somewhere around. (235 words)

Different people are asked to write down whether they thought I and this man were to become lovers or best friends or what. These people are couples. I am reading their responses. They've written them at various stations or places in a room. One couple describes how we learn from each other and grow and do things better because we're together. They think we should get on with it and be lovers or a couple. Another has some reservation and says best friends. But the overwhelming majority thinks we'll be a couple. There's lots of curiosity and build-up excitement about revealing the answers. Now one man has applied for a job. We are interviewing him. He's quite qualified and charming, but I don't completely trust him and I'm double checking his materials. I find a black circle. I ask him to verify that he didn't already give copies of these to the woman president of the college in his admission materials. He's suspicious now. I'm on to him. I continue looking for evidence. Someone yells, "Quick, come look here." I go up on the high open roof where there's a stone wall around the edge (like in a castle). I look over the edge to discover he'd placed a ladder there for his escape after he'd killed. I see he's found me and I struggle and push the escape ladder away from the wall as I also struggle against his attack on me. He's got a blue-colored syringe thing with poison in it and he's trying to stab it in my neck. I fight hard, and as I finally succeed in shoving the ladder far enough for it to fall away, he lunges to rescue it, miscalculates and tumbles over the edge, screaming as he falls to his death. I had nearly been killed and I wake up still feeling the fear and racing heartbeat. I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack. (325 words)

I am on a boat. The planet has been changed somehow. Dangerous aliens have come and transformed things. Ellie is sort of the captain. She informs me she is going to go out there and have unlimited sexual encounters and won't particularly care if she protects herself. I take something she'd been hoarding that would enable her to do that and hide it in my leggings. Ellie is pissed at me. She announces we are about to crash full speed into land. I don't even brace myself. I look out the window and see us coming to land. We crash and are now walking. We find a small hill which has triangles and markings and buttons on it and we realize this is the command com the aliens used. Now a woman approaches. She is one of the aliens. Apparently they used to be mechanical, and due to the crash and emergency conditions here, they had to transform into organic material. They are very unused to being in a body. She points to a small rainbow-colored sort of pony-like creature. I ask, "What the heck is that?" "A horse," she says. I laugh, realizing they had taken their concepts of what animals and people are from a child's book of illustrations, an artist's rendition of reality, and copied that. She shows me other animals. We're sort of in this together. (230 words)

I am driving myself to a lecture I will be giving at a rich upperclass church. I am self-sufficient and well-dressed. I get there and get out of the van to see that there is a flight of stairs up to the church. I sit in my wheelchair, waiting for them to come out and get me in. They have to pick me up, four men, and carry me up the stairs to the stage. I know they are embarrassed and am glad they have this visual lesson. I sit proud and tall. I look down at the audience and begin by talking about how huge and spacious the room is and how it dwarfs the audience with its presence. I then tell them how distant they are from the stage and how unusually high the stage is from them. I use this as part of my lecture on how they choose to keep themselves separate and distant. I am honest, forthright and kind. (164 words)

I am privy to being around the President of the United States. He has selected a new cabinet, new things are going to happen, or there is a potential for it to happen. I am introduced to them. They are powerful and I'm not sure if they'll be good powerful or bad powerful. The First Lady comes in and greets a man, one of the new cabinet members, in a old friends kind of way. She waves at his wife, also her good friend. The President introduces her jokingly as the Last Lady. I sit on the floor, cross legged and informal, watching all this and aware that although I am not really a part of it, because I am being permitted to hang around, eventually I'll make my place among them. A woman comes up. I see she has placed a wrinkled brown paper bag on the table near my place setting. I open it and take out a pretty brown and olive green wool suit. I know she is taking me under her wing and is trying to spruce me up, I say, "Thanks," and then say, "but be warned, sometimes I deliberately wear polyester!" To make a statement, I'll dress "inappropriately." (204 words)

I am on a "raft," which is really a wooden box floating on a river. This is some college retreat conference and also a tourist shaman experience. I notice the sides of the box undo at the nails and one side falls off. I broke the raft. I take it to the old woman native. She looks at me and suggests I do the shaman course. I don't really want to, but it could be fun. I go, not fully into it with my heart, mostly curious. Mabel is there somewhere. We are floating down a river past buildings where military personnel are living, working and studying. I see one room with women military personnel in a classroom. I see strong, good-looking men walking around. Now I'm in the river and my teacher's helper is supposed to dive and show me how to retrieve the knives he has dropped deliberately. One knife is huge, a butcher knife. Another one is small, a paring knife. I watch and then I go under water and retrieve a knife. The old woman is impressed with me. I am going to be a shaman.

I now live in M City and trying to make it there in a new environment. I see two women; one makes some special blocks for the other. The other woman's name is Bette Davis. The woman follows her, trying to give her the blocks, saying, "I adore you." Bette Davis isn't accepting this. I wonder if this is lesbian and it doesn't feel like it. Now I am visiting Aunt Naomi who lives in a camper trailer behind my parents' house. Ellie comes in to talk to Aunt Naomi. I recognize she's here to do some dramatic storytelling and really doesn't want me around to spoil her fun. But I stay and listen in as Ellie whispers to her that she's a bit worried because she's been getting into weird practices again. I say, "Oh, you mean wanting to be Catholic." I am guessing, trying to appear as if I know what's up. I had noticed she's been wearing a big cross necklace. Now it is a metal Bible on a chain around her neck. I say, "Or maybe even wanting to be a nun." "No Mom," Ellie says, "I play at hanging myself." It's a ritual sort of fantasy thing. I am shocked and concerned. I say, "Honey, this is sick. Something is wrong with you that needs looking to." She listens, but goes on wanting to talk with Naomi. I pull Naomi aside and say, "Go ahead and listen to her; she needs support right now. I'll take care of doing something later." I then tell Naomi I've been living in M City, to be near the grandkids, but it's not working out. It occurs to me that I could move back to E City and I see my A. Street house and the white apartment as possible places where I could return. Then I say, "I could even move to Dover." Naomi thinks about this and says, "Probably not Dover, too much traffic." I am excited by the idea of moving and reconnecting with new people, new ideas, etc. I go outside to leave and find Aunt Rosalie, Darcy and Deirdre stopping by to visit Aunt Naomi. I ask them where they are headed. They won't tell me. It's like a secret. I am annoyed. They are here to wash their clothes and rest up and then they're on their way. I keep asking them where they're going and how come they won't tell me. Darcy sighs and says "Venita (or Venusian) near E City." It's an indirect hint, but it's the most she's going to say and she's annoyed I keep pressing her. (438 words)

I am a waitress at a cafe. My woman boss is very meek. I tell her to remember she is the boss and I teach her to be assertive. A young couple is at one back table. They are in love. Now the playwright group gathers. Eric has some stuff to share. I see the name "B" on one. He announces he has won a short story contest in an important newspaper. I say, "I am envious," but I also am aware the story is about me, so I'm also happy or curious. He starts to read the story, then pauses and says, "I have finally learned what it takes to write, after all these years. You just write...from the heart." I smile because I knew that and he is absolutely right. I'm thinking this story about me, then, must be emotional and from the heart. This pleases me. Now he reads it. It says "WELCOME, B." in headlines. Then it says, "I find you in many places, in between the thin mucus layers of my ____" (a body part, maybe the nose). "You are in 482 points in my" (another body part), "and in 7008 places in my (stomach lining?)" Then he goes on to describe trees and the (state) scenery and so on. I feel a bit disappointed and comment, "I don't like the ending." It doesn't feel like the story had continuity. How can this story have been good enough to win the contest? (247 words)

I am in a room with Eric and some others, one of them a man in a wheelchair (not Derek, but I like him sort of like Derek). I want to tell them of this amazing coincidence of me having a dream about Nate writing this story about me and then here we are together to talk stories. We are walking down some flights of stairs to find a quiet place to talk. I open a door and see a Hult Center type auditorium with some show going on, on the stage. I close the door. We go down another flight of stairs to find a dingy metal green basement and we go back up that one flight of stairs. We go through the Hult Center door and walk quietly through the hall at the back of the audience to a cafe. We sit. The tables are small, square ones, room for two at each table. Now some other people are with us and I want there to be room for the man with the wheelchair to sit at my table across from me so he can enjoy the dream I'm going to tell. Now my father is seated at the end on the left and my mother at my left. A young couple in love is between my parents. My Aunt Rosalie is on my right. My father comes in smiling with a tray of special desserts he bought for the young couple to honor this moment (of wedding or being in love). It interrupts my starting to tell the dream. We admire and look at what's on the tray -- red and white striped ice cream swirled in a dish, a bottle of what looks like champagne, but my mother looks at the label and we agree it's almost champagne, the cheaper version. My father is smiling, very pleased with himself. I am a bit annoyed, but still trying to get the attention so I can tell this interesting dream coincidence thing. Now I see my father has on some kind of mask which hides his gentle, kind face. I try to speak and he sounds like he wants to hear, but then he interrupts with a story of his own or something and I go quiet. Now Aunt Rosalie is having an argument with Sparky off in another room and I feel angry and put upon. My day is getting spoiled. I feel guilty because my relatives have somehow taken over this day and Sparky is going to be mad at me because we've moved in and not paid our share for the rooms. I didn't mean for this to happen. It's beginning to look hopeless that I'll be able to impress this man in the wheelchair like I'd like to with my fine story. I am frustrated and sad. (473 words)

George and I are in his house. I am visiting. He wants to sketch me. I sit, half lie, on the couch in a restful pose. He sketches. He likes me very much. Now I am walking through the room drinking some milk out of a gallon glass jug. I am going to the refrigerator to put the milk back in. I feel a bit guilty about drinking right out of the jug. Now I walk back through the living room and watch his parents, or somebody's parents, arguing. The teen daughter is mad at them. The mother has her back to us and is telling the stepfather to leave. This makes the teen daughter happy. I walk past and am touring the house. I see a large room with lots of spacious windows. The river, brown and muddy is swirling in and rising. I am a bit concerned, but not too much. Perhaps it won't rise so high as to enter the rest of the house. I see an elephant swimming in the river, in the room, and two alligator/part human creatures wrestling each other. I walk on and see an adjourning room, George's brother's room. It too is semi-flooded. Now George is showing me his room. He opens the door and I see a narrow, long, empty closet. I try to see a bedroom. I pull back a cloth, perhaps tie-died, to peek behind it and only see the wall with old wallpaper on it. But now it opens up and is his bedroom. There are plants, a living tree, and huge sky windows in the ceiling. I look up and see huge piles of junk, mostly empty cardboard boxes, empty wine bottles and so on, hanging upside down. I say to George, "Hey, is that really up there above my head, or is this just a perspective, point of view thing" He says, "It's just the perspective." I am relieved. I now walk through back door, a lovely glass door, and see the outside. I see a pond, which is a continuation of the river, less muddy. There's a marker rope and then the pond widens out into a lake where recreation things are happening -- little paddle boats, swimmers, etc. I start to walk over there, but George comes out, perhaps in a wheelchair, and says to me,"Wait. Stay with me. I love you." (398 words)

A large house. I notice I'd been only living in a few of the rooms and have many empty rooms I can expand into. I could have an art room, a writing room, a music room. I am having a good time finding furniture to move into these empty rooms. I choose to take the breakfast things out to a table on an outdoor landing. It will be pleasant and unusual. Ginny is there.

Nightmare. I have red, white and blue poker chips and these black men are trying to take them from me. I run away and dive in the river. I swim just to the left of the other woman captive, only I am just under the surface of the water. I know it is a good, safe spot for me. They are looking for me. They will rape and hurt me if they find me, and take away my poker chips. (80 words)

My cousin Terence is flirting with me. He'd wrestle gently and I'd accidentally fall back on the floor and he'd "fall" on top of me and we'd sneak kisses and so on. It was very pleasant and I knew vaguely it wasn't right, but it was so delicious, I didn't work hard to avoid it. He was an adventurer, a wanderer, and was home for a short while. I was working on a play. (74 words)

I am married to Howard and have a baby. I am deeply angry at him. I won't let him speak to me. He tries to apologize and make up, but I won't let him. Even though I am bitterly angry, I continue to do my work. I sweep, mop, hang up clothes, and take care of the baby. I am a good wife, but angry. (65 words)

I read a book that took me along time to get into, but after I kept at it a while, became interesting. It is a series of vignettes about towns, the last one being Mapleton. Now I decide to move to Mapleton. I am biking down the old highway and see a lovely stretch of grass and decide to bike across the "moors" for fun. It's very pretty and pastoral. Now I am in town and finish my errand and am biking back to my new home. My front wheel keeps getting caught in the old grooves of the asphalt and it pulls me a bit, so I struggle to keep on the road. I manage. I cross a bridge. I see I have a long way to go, maybe eight miles. I hope I get home before dark. I'll be tired, but oh well, it's a pretty ride and an adventure. I am munching on carrot sticks. As I approach a railroad crossing, the red lights come on. I know I'm supposed to stop, but I don't. I slow down and look and then scoot across anyway. At the last track to cross I look up and realize the train is almost upon me. I get across and then see the crossing guard bar. I think, "How silly of me to have forgotten they'd be down, how will I get by?" Then I see a way to sneak around the end. I am hearing the nuns chant as they go to seek answers or information from a young mystic girl. She was called a "pronuncio." She keeps repeating over and over, "You can not be plotted. You cannot be dated." [BL] (281 words)

I have a big, rotting black space on my back teeth. Food is lodged there and a cavity is there. I keep picking at it and bits come out. Finally two teeth have fallen out and chips have been removed. I have a hard time getting my jaw to open enough to inspect it and work on it, but this time as I look, I see the teeth are hard and white and fixed. My work had a positive result. I comment to someone that since I'd chosen to sit in the high chair with the toddler baby girl, I'd been able to take better care of my teeth and they got better. The little girl is lively and cute. The high chair is an old-fashioned, little thin metal one. (130 words)

I am trying to clean up the messy floor. There is lots of dust and dirt and lint and so on. I start with a broom and realize all that sawdust will be hard to do with a broom, so I get a vacuum cleaner as well. I'm working hard to clean it all up. [BL] (55 words)

I am at a cabin at the ocean on the front porch. I see a mother cat and her baby kittens, white and black, sort of spotted, striped. I sit and hold one kitten and cuddle it. It is very sweet and cute. Derek wheels out. He's a bit pudgy in the middle, sort of a comfortable teddy bear kind of guy, and I put my head in his lap and we are very happy, sitting together playing with the kitten. It is soft and comfortable. Then it is time to go, to move on, and we go inside to clean up before we leave. The floor is a mess: dust balls, dirt, lots of stuff. I am sweeping with a broom. Derek is trying to clean the floor also. The landlord comes in and is annoyed and gruff, saying we haven't cleaned it all up yet. I am angry at him and we have words. The dream sort of fades out at this point. (165 words)

I am somewhere, inside. Derek had been there and had just left. I see Lisa (playwright) and she is dancing playfully with a very close girlfriend. They kiss. I wonder for a moment if they are lesbian. A man nearby doesn't approve. I need to find a bathroom. I'm at a University, maybe a building like Autzen Stadium. I go down lots of halls looking for an accessible bathroom. Then I see a book stall where they sell writing things. I see the pens and am now looking for the right pen. I see the cheaper ones and hope to find a good-feeling pen there, but am drawn to the really pretty ones that are more expensive, fountain pens with clicker tops and feathers attached to the cap. They are special pens to be used at special occasions where there are guest books to be signed. But I will use this pen for my writing. I test it out and like the way the wet ink looks on the paper, only it spots a few blue ink marks on my hand. I kind of like that, a mark of a writer. Then the ink thins out and it's scratchy on the paper. Maybe this is the demo pen and I could find one that writes more consistently better. I find a colorful one with iridescent colors, but it has a kind of rough, scratchy feeling when I try it. No good for me. Needs to be a smooth ride. (249 words)

A couple started their relationship very loving and richly caring. Then it became fighting and distant. I come into the house and see fettucine on the floor, not cleaned up. I go in and am wishful of the beginning time again when things were loving. Now I am in the streets, trying to find City Hall, the City Planning Department. I guess I need a permit or something. Another woman, perhaps a sister, and I are lost. I see a building and go over to it and realize this is it. I go in. There are marble floors, fancy signs, etc. I see the directory. I can't make out what floor the department is on. I go to the elevator and get in, determined to go to each floor, although I think it is maybe 4th floor or 9th floor. A young man comes into the elevator backwards with an old ritualistic step, like a hop (Raymond like feet). I get out and have found the office. My sister Lydia is there and a man. I am looking around the nearly empty room thinking this would be a great room to do my writing in. I go to a window with an attic-like enclosure structure around the window, which makes an alcove, and think, "This would be where I'd love to put my writing desk." I go there and notice that when I sit there, I can see a lovely view of an old Victorian house out the other window. Now the man is in love with Lydia and we are wearing old-fashioned long silk dresses (1800's). She has black hair tied up in ringlets and mine is blonde. The man wants us to go to his house. We do. He is very rich and the house is a Victorian mansion. He introduces Lydia to his mother; they try on a bridal gown for her. I try to take a picture of her and look through the lenses of her glasses to take the picture. One lens is scorched and scratched from her having looked through it. I look at her through it and say, "Too bad the colors won't turn out well. I guess I'll take the picture just to have a memory snapshot. It won't be a good picture." I snap the picture and finish the roll of (reel?) film. I start to open the back of the camera too quickly. I hope I didn't ruin the picture. Now Lydia and the man's mother go out of the room to make arrangements for the wedding. The man comes over to me; he also secretly loves me. I am aware of his feelings and try to deflect or ignore them. I look out the window as he tries to press his face near mine and tries to turn my face so he can kiss me. Finally I say, without giving him much eye contact, "You love my sister, sir. This cannot be." He is sad. He now wants to give me a tour of the house. He goes down to the end of a hall and opens a door. I look in. It's a bedroom, fairly modern and ordinary looking. There are two beds, one with a yellow bedspread, one with a blue-green one. I say, shocked, "Why have you shown me a private room?" I realize it is his bedroom. I turn and start to walk away, down the hall. He goes into the room and comes back out hurriedly with a small box that has a bird egg collection. It was his when he was a boy. I am touched. Then Lydia and his mom returns and he hurriedly covers the bird's egg collection with a piece of cloth so they won't see. Somehow this is too intimate for our relationship. Lydia is carrying a huge tray with goblets and things on it. It is too heavy for her and I see from her eyes she is on the verge of being hysterical. He takes the tray from her to help and I say to him, "Take care of her," and I leave the house. I am vaguely aware they are going to send out their car to take me home, but I don't know for sure, so I hesitate and look around. I see a big square limo (more shaped like a hearse, only more box-like). It is picking up or leaving off a young woman in a wheelchair; must be the neighbors. I start to walk. I stop and hesitate again looking back. I see a regular, but fancy car. Maybe that's it. A woman comes around the porch of the neighbor's house and I offer to buy a candy in her tray for a ruble. I see a second boxy limo and walk back. Another woman comes over and says in an angry haughty voice that she is appalled I would offer a ruble to the neighbor woman, thinking she was the maid. Something about not being in my own class and putting on airs. (841 words)

I am going to N City. I am driving a car and am alone. First I am lost. I can't remember which way to turn, left or right. I decide left, then there are many lanes of fast traffic and as I speed up to merge, I don't do well. A white car is forced to speed up and leap over me. A second car grazes my fender. I am concerned because I could be in real danger here, I almost had two car wrecks. I come to another turn, then a bridge construction where a man holds up a stop sign. I put on my brakes (I had spelled it breaks!), but am not slowing down fast enough. My Grandma Agnes is a passenger and someone else is in the back seat. They are trying to brake also. We are concerned. I pull to the right so I don't crash into the other cars and end up stopped way over the stop line. I am embarrassed at my driving skills. I continue on, a bit lost again.

Ellie is going away for a few days and I decide to go to N City for the day and then put myself in a foster care home for a few days until Ellie returns. I am curious what it would be like and it would be nice to be taken care of. Ellie warns me to take the back streets out of town because the main street is clogged with traffic because of a football game or something. I try to, but get all twisted around and find dead ends and odd corners and end up going out of town the wrong way, up over the mountains toward M City (I think I'm in M City). I try to find a place to turn around, but that will put me in the traffic jam. Then I realize the game is started because the traffic has freed up some. I stop by the foster home to check in. The helpers are very busy with the other patients. Two colorful cowboy hats (huge) with little short puppet like legs keep darting in and the helpers keep chasing them away playfully. They are dancers. Two of the helpers are choreographers of dance. I see a table with color pens and markers on it. I realize I'd forgotten to pick up Charla to take to N City with me. I decide to call her and then go back and get her. I try to get Ellie's number out of my electronic address book. I type in "B" and it keeps being mistyped with extra letters. I repeatedly try to do it and am unsuccessful. I finally realize I'm in the wrong search mode. I also realize this isn't the right place for me. They do too much help; they are used to patients with severe difficulties and I'm really quite self-sufficient. I am a bit embarrassed. As I am leaving, one woman has penciled in art work on her white smock or blouse. I comment on them. She has started to color them in. I comment on the brilliant purple and orange colors. I like them. If I stayed, I'd probably want to use those coloring pens and draw something. As the woman goes out ahead of me, she's saying she won't be here Monday night, and I know that I won't be coming back here. I'm going home after my N City visit. I feel good about this decision.

I am seated in an easy chair and a small, deformed baby girl is trying to move around near me. I reach out to touch her lovingly and encouragingly. She doesn't want to be touched. Her eyes are puffy, wrinkled small like a burn victim, and lots of burn scars on her tender, hurting body. She pulls back and I say gently to her "It's all right. I won't touch you if you don't want." I smile. She keeps close and wiggles around so that she is actually permitting us to be nearly touching, shyly letting me be close. I keep talking lovingly and then she reaches out and pulls herself on to me. I must touch her to keep her from falling and only do it gently and with intent to support her own movements, never as a holding or a restriction. I am very happy she lets me do this. Then she sees another baby, a newborn, laying on the chair near me. It too looks oddly deformed, sharp, pointed head, elfin ears. She wants to touch the baby. I help her move over there, at one point needing to pick her up and adjust her position so she can get where she obviously wants to go. I apologize to her encouragingly so she knows I'm only doing what she will permit. Then she opens her mouth and tries to swallow the baby's head, out of curiosity, only now it's not a baby but some tiny toy yellow plastic shoes like for a doll. I am a bit concerned she'll swallow them and get hur, but she's all right. Then Ginny is seated to my right and she says, "I can't ever hear your American Woman play without only hearing you. I laugh and say, "I understand. Mirabelle can't either. Both of you know me so well you can't hear the universality of it." She agrees. I laugh suddenly as I am now aware that there are a number of cute fuzzy cats with beautiful eyes all looking right at me as I am speaking. I say to Ginny, "Oh, this is so great. Look, there are..." and I count up to thirteen, then add fourteen so it won't be an unlucky number. I repeat, "There are fourteen cats staring at me right now." I laugh richly at the beauty and fun of it. (396 words)

I go over to Derek's house, worried, because he had called and asked me to come over and I knew he was in trouble. I get to the door and it has been kicked around so that it is in three thin sheets. I get in and see papers and stuff strewn all around. He'd been throwing and breaking things. I say, "Hello." He calls out, "Here." He's in the bedroom. I go down the hall and go into the bedroom. Instead of a regular bed, he is wrapped up in a wet suit material like sack. He's plugged into a sort of bathtub bed. His face is entirely covered with a blue plated mask. I can see an eye peek out and a bit of his tousled hair. He is writhing in pain and sadness. I sit down on the foam, wet sack, and try to stroke him to help calm him. I haven't a clue what part I'm touching, maybe below the break where he can't feel it, or up on his chest. I soothe him and tousle his hair a bit as he wiggles and squirms around, groaning. He lightly kisses me back, near my breasts, and is trying to acknowledge my presence. It is hard for him. I am wearing a pair of shorts, dark blue, and a summer blouse. Sometimes I am naked. It is semi-sexy and very intimate, but the purpose is to assist him through this bad time. He tries to put more warm water into the sack he's in and I feel the coolness leave the sack and it is warm. Then he unplugs his catheter bag down by his feet, which is plugged into the tub drain. (286 words)

I am in a room where lots of activities are going on, like ladies playing cards at a table, and two women seated, reading, etc. I am there to have a session with my psychiatrist. I call him Dwight. He says to me, "I don't feel comfortable with you calling me by my first name so informally. I prefer you call me Dr._____ because you are a very repressed woman and it would embarrass me to be out socially or in public and have people think we are friends." He then hesitates about wanting to do the session in this room because of all the other people. I want that session, so I efficiently go over and pick up the table the ladies are at and walk it out the door, forcing the ladies to follow so they can finish their card game. I then go to the two women in easy chairs and say to them, "Please try to read more quietly." I feel pretty good about taking care of the situation. I remember the doctor had a tuft of gray hair on one side of his face, maybe his left as he faces me. Others had that same kind of tuft of hair. It's like a bushy sideburn, only growing out of his cheek. (216 words)

A native American man is telling a story in some auditorium. I listen. He comes up to me later and wants to meet me and get my opinion. He likes me intensely. I have two daughters who are sleeping on a pile of coats. This is a pow-wow kind of thing. He kisses me passionately. He wants me. I am very attracted and turned on, but I hesitate and say, "I have to take the girls home." He says, "We can find a place for them to sleep here." He says, "We don't have to make love now, or anything, but please just stay." He says it with such strong need and desire and love for me. I kiss him passionately. I will stay. (124 words)

It is dream night. Some new people have come. Derek tells his dream. I'd heard this one before and remind him of a detail he'd left out. Then I begin to tell my dream. Just then, lots of people, all dressed up for a fancy party, come in and now the woman who is new to the dream group is decorating my fancy, ritzy apartment for a party. It's her friend's birthday. I am shocked and upset. She simply takes over and very quickly the place is crawling with strangers and the music is blaring and the decorations are all over. Derek says to me, "I don't know about you, but if it were me, I'd be extremely pissed." I pace back and forth, back and forth, angry, and yet, look at all the trouble they went to. It's so big it would be impossible to get them out and they'd be angry at me. I pace some more. Derek hands me a bottle of drink and I take swigs off it as I pace. I ask what it is because I can't taste it. He says, "It's apple juice." Now I am walking through the rooms, watching, my eyes blazing in anger. I go to my bedroom. Derek sees in my face that I'm about to go ballistic and he loves it. He's grinning from ear to ear and following me around. I go into my bedroom and check to see if any of my jewelry had been taken. Then I find a couple making love in my bed and I start screaming, "Everybody out. The party's over!" I grab women by the hair and drag them to the door. I start ripping down decorations and wires to music speakers. I grab a microphone from the party MC and tell everyone to get out. "This is my apartment and no one asked me permission to have this party and it's over." I am getting them all out as they bitch and complain and get sullen. (336 words)

I wake up in a double bed, at Nate's house. He is standing at the side of the bed saying, "Wake up, Barb, look at what I got you." I open my eyes sleepily and look to see the bed is covered with lots of coins, mostly quarters. It is Nate's little joke gift for me. I am very aware of his mother at the end of the bed suspiciously watching my reactions. I remain calm and noncommittal. Somehow, I am their guest for the weekend. My father is around somewhere. I get up, trying to be casual. Nate is now standing at the other end of the room, leaning against the wall talking to his girlfriend. I feel like a fifth wheel. I am uncomfortable. Later, we have a quick moment of aloneness to talk as I try to find my two purses in the airplane to carry with me so no one will steal my money. We can't touch or kiss as his mother is lurking around watching. (170 words)

I am sitting on a rocking bench in a coffee house, cafe. Listening to a group of singers. The woman singer screws up and has to start the song over a number of times. it's OK. Nobody seems to mind. I sit there alone. A man, lean, skinny, a bit of a day growth of beard comes over and sits next to me. We'd met once before, he reminds me. We talk a bit and slowly he comes closer and I open to him and now I'm almost sitting in his lap, my arm around his neck and the feeling is tentative. I wonder if he's just making the moves, but I like him. We are rocking the bench. He says, "Look." I say, "At what?" He says, "Look," and looks over to the left side of the bench where a small disk drive from my computer is sitting. When we rock, it makes the disk drive lights come on and off (yellow and green). I chuckle. He then asks me if I want to go to Coffee Joe's or some other coffee bar. I am interested, but I say, "I don't like coffee, sorry." He says something like, "Well, I've been thinking of giving it up." We smile. He nibbles gently on my arm. We rock some more. Then he says, "Do you like your____?" I say "What? I couldn't get the word you said." He repeats the question at least three times because I'm not understanding the last word. He repeats it again. "Vidas," I say, "what's that?" He says, "Your tapes." I decide that means my writing. I shrug and think for a moment. I say, "Yeah, most of it, I do. Some of it is shitty, especially the earlier stuff. But I'm going to be rewriting it, making it better." I say to him gently, "And you? I'll bet you're the creative type." He closes his eyes and I see a look of pain and longing. I understand this. He is creative, but can't get to it, or doesn't do it, or doesn't believe in himself. I touch his face affectionately. Now we are interrupted by two young people, his friends. The scraggly teen boy makes sign language gestures. They are telling him it's time to go. The boy then says, "You always get the girls." The man smiles a bit sadly. It's true, he always gets the girls, but so what? He then kisses me and I return the kiss, but it is not all that pleasant. I am disappointed a bit, a kiss open-mouthed without much good response. Oh well. He's leaving now. (439 words)

A heavyset man with a black beard, a "bear" of a man, is traveling by horse across a southwestern desert. His horse is carrying secret listening devices from the CIA to spy on him. He doesn't know they are there. Now I am a young woman in a long dress (1800's) on a horse and he is taking me across the desert. He had gotten off his horse and peed. I could see the shadow of his back and hear the water hit the ground. Then he sits to have a bowel movement. Then he realizes the CIA devices are on the horse and removes them. Now I am sick with fever or heat stroke. The man is now sort of Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford/Derek) and he takes off my many layers of socks, five or six he counts, and shakes his head because that is too stupid in this environment. He strips off my clothes and lays me on a blanket, naked, and covers me with another blanket. But now he is sexually aroused because I am pretty and naked. He takes all his clothes off and stands near me. I can't see his penis, but it's there. Then he lays down on me. I am on my tummy and our skins touch and it is soft and gentle, but I am very afraid. I beg him to please leave me alone. He is hot with desire and yet knows this is wrong to take advantage of me, so he just lays there wanting me and feeling our skins touch, but not doing much else. I don't know if he's going to be honorable and I beg and cry in fear. I feel the tip of his hard penis on my leg and then he stands up and leaves me alone. I fall into a fevered sleep. He takes care of me. (313 words)

I am in a huge ranch house. I live there. I am walking back through the rooms. Perhaps I heard some noise that makes me think someone is prowling around. As I pass through a series of large rooms, I notice a man in an alcove where a telephone booth is. He's not supposed to be there. I go to him and demand he leave. He's some reporter from National Public Radio (NPR) wanting to interview some things that are going on around my ranch house. I am not interested in these events, nor am I happy he's around. I tell him to leave and try to lock the window screen. I realize there are a lot of windows that are part way open and so on. It would be impossible to get him out if he kept trying to get in. He goes out to his crew. I go back to the main living room where my "dad" sits in a chair and I see a lunch pail or file box by him and realize this sneaky man has gotten permission from my father to not only do his news stories but to be in the house. I am very upset. I've decided I really don't like this good-looking man. He is in the other room, at the doorway, listening to me, smiling, because he likes me. He likes my feistiness too. So I now know he's going to be around and there's nothing I can do about it. I grudgingly go sit on the couch next to him, which is the first sign that I am realizing I do like him and am attracted to him. He is Republican and I am Democrat, but I have the feeling he is starting to make a decision to change as he is getting fed up with the Republicans. He has a packet of material, a press release kind of thing, political. He's signing his signature. A man (maybe the "dad") watches how he signs his name and does some in imitation to help him out. I go look at the signature, which is a wild scribbling in black ink, then a series of pastel colored hash marks in a sort of vague flower shape. I notice that each time he does his signature, it is uniquely different. I start to do some of the packets for him, imitating his signature. (400 words)

I am in the M City house. I am talking to Ellie and I suddenly remember that I have a pretty white cat with cocoa brown ears in a cage upstairs and I haven't remembered her for weeks. Perhaps she has died for lack of food and water. I feel horrible. I say to Ellie that usually my helpers fed her, but lately I haven't needed so much help and I just forgot about feeding the cat. I feel like a murderer. I go quickly upstairs and I'm suddenly surprised to remember that my parents had remodeled this upstairs bedroom area before they moved out and left the house to me. I go into the big bedroom and I'm surprised to see how changed it is and realize I've lived in the house for months and haven't even gone up here to look. Somehow, perhaps Ellie went up and got the cat or whatever, but now she is out of her cage and seems to be fine. Maybe her legs are a bit shaky from lack of exercise and the confinement of the cage. I am grateful she is alive. My other cats, a black fuzzy one and another white one, only with light brown paws and lower legs, are all playing together. I am happy they get along so well. Now, I look around the room. It's quite large, painted off-white and there's a fireplace on one wall. I try to remember what it looked like when I was a child and I lived there, thinking my bed used to be in that corner. I turn to the right and see the bed, a double bed, and two fireplaces and a gas stove-like thing in between. There are fires burning in them and I am again surprised and upset with myself. This has been untended for months. It could have burned the house down. I wonder how it kept going so well so long and decide they are gas fireplaces. I see a control box and try to read the instructions so I can turn off the fires. I wonder if I should let them continue to burn, because it must help heat up the house. I notice the ceiling, which is not finished. There are holes between the boards. This part of the remodel apparently never got finished. I see objects on the ceiling above the bed, and lay down to see what my parents wanted to see when they were lying down. An old musket rifle, another rifle, and a strange fox hunt horn like thing are on the ceiling. "That's weird," I think. Then my father comes into the room and asks if I want the air adjusted. I say, "Sure." He gets a stick (pole) and reaches up to a high shelf to manipulate something. I watch so I'll know how to do it. Then I see a mirror and see my mother reflected. She is painting a picture. I turn to see where she should have been from the reflected image, which would be the wall where the fireplaces are, only she's not there. I step closer to the mirror. This is really weird. She's in there, or maybe it's a window to another room, only now it's not my mother but some man painting. I turn back to look at the room and see several more people are there. I see my mother and suddenly with horror I realize it's not her, nor is that man my father. Aliens are there in human form. They start to surround me. I see a younger man coming closer. A woman is in front of me and they say, "Your face is changed too." I now have a hand mirror and see with horror it is not my face. The lips are pointed, like Patricia's. I'd rather have my own face back. I liked it better. I strike the approaching woman with the hand mirror across her face and this hurts her. She stumbles back. The man approaches and I hit him. I realize I can hurt them and in the confusion I run for the stairs. I managed to get to the living room, with the man right behind me. He nearly has me and I keep hitting him with the mirror, using the handle to poke him in the groin as well. I dash outside to the street, cross the street, still hitting at the man and screaming, "Help, help." Finally a bunch of cars and pickup trucks stop and people are getting out to help me. The man runs away. I realize I can't tell them the truth about what happened. They'll think I'm crazy and put me away. I also realize it's going to take some getting used to being this other person, with this other face. I wake up, hearing that cry for help, "Help, help," still echoing in my mind. (820 words)

I am now in a huge, enclosed place, like a mall, only the aliens are all over the place, killing and torturing people. One family of aliens in human form live in a house in this mall-like place. I and my husband, Michael Keaton, are their slaves. We watch their children for them. We are trying to think of ways to escape. I realize suddenly that maybe the reason they hurt us so easily without any care or concern is that they cannot feel pain and therefore do not know what they are doing to us, that they are causing us such suffering. We know that somehow we have to get them to feel the pain. I strike at the woman and Michael tries to hurt the man. Finally the woman feels some pain and starts to understand. She is upset now that they are hurting us and assures me I was a good caretaker for their children. Michael and I run. We see that there is sleet or hail falling outside and we know we must get these aliens out there to feel that, maybe slip and fall or feel it hitting them. We run through the mall halls and they all give chase. We duck into a series of rooms, and Michael comes out of one room with the alien woman saying in a dazed and stupidly happy way, "God, the sex was great." I realize he'd actually stopped in the middle of all this crisis and had sex with the alien. He says to her, "Now how about I rub your _____, a bony part of the back, which is how they have sex." I am not happy about all this, but it is more important to get these aliens outside, so I get Michael's attention and he comes out of his euphoria. We run more, get split up I signal to him, "I'm going down this hall," and he is blocked from me by aliens and he hand signals he understands and will meet me later. I run down a huge flight of stairs. I don't want to fall because then I'd feel the pain, not them. I get to the outside door only to see that there are gang thugs out there and the cops are not going to be helpful. I chance it and run through the alley, only to find myself in another enclosed mall space. I keep trying to get out to the open air. (413 words)

I am in Derek's house and it is dream group time. I see a woman standing with her back to me and I say, "Hi, Lisa." She turns and it isn't Lisa. I feel embarrassed, especially since that might make Derek know I was thinking about him and Lisa. Derek decides to go to the grocery store. Then an overweight man sits on the couch and I sit next to him and then Eric comes and sits on my right. It's very cozy. I am explaining to them what we did at the last meeting that they had missed. I am telling them and then I ask for my notes. Derek is back and he hands me my note pad. I open it and laugh realizing that I thought I'd written words but I had only drawn pictures to remind me. That's not going to help the people who weren't there. Then I pick up another note pad and see writing. I try to read it, but I see I've only written a few words or phrases to remind me. One says, "Three strikes and you're out," then a space and then two other words, "jerk" and another word. I say to the overweight man, "I can't remember what this was about." Derek comes up to me with a silly grin on his face and I say, "What's with the Kirk Douglas grin?" I then look over next to him on his right and see the real Kirk Douglas. Derek had met him in the grocery store and brought him home to meet us. Kirk is interested in me and is flirting. Derek is a little jealous of that and of how I let those two men sit so close to me on the couch. (295 words)

I am on a big motorcycle (probably a Harley Davidson). I am going down a highway and coming to a bridge. A man on a motorcycle is in the left lane and I feel like racing him so I speed up. He's pretty fast. Then I notice a racing course across the river and I turn right, off the highway and down to the wooden bridge with a break in the middle, for the motorcycle to jump. I rev up and go like hell, leaping over the expanse of water and then landing in the mud and sand trap set there to make the course really difficult. I squirrel around in the mud and sand cleverly, "riding" the ruts left there by other bikers. I am very successful and the head biker is watching with appreciation and interest. He wants to know who I am, so he starts to follow me. I ride away fast to try and lose him. I end up at the University, where I teach, get off the bike, and changed clothes real fast and go up to my classroom and teach. When I return to the bike, he and his biker cronies are there waiting for me to return so they can meet me and know who I am. I hide and listen in to their conversation. I am attracted to the head biker and finally reveal myself to him. We make love. It feels great. (241 words)

I am talking with Howard about arrangements for the Christmas party. It's a big annual event and I already bought my pretty blue formal gown. Howard says he doesn't know if he wants to go. He'll be busy teaching and can't get there until 10:00 at night. Half the party will be over by then. I sigh. I say, "Oh well, I'm still going." I then am talking to Lucy on the phone. She is sighing and saying she doesn't know if she wants to go to all the work and trouble of going to the party. I am pouring kayo syrup over Rice Krispies and eating it all with a spoon. It is thick and too much syrup, but very, very sweet. I say, "Yeah, I know. I'm not sure why I'm going either. Howard won't be there until late, so I'll be alone. I don't like the people there. They are so correct and so judgmental all the time. I kind of like to do things differently, my own way just to annoy them, but it is tiring hearing their point of view all the time. MAYBE I'll FLIRT WITH THIS CUTE MAN I know. After all I've already got the dress." Then Lucy says, "Maybe I'll stay home and write a book with all my accomplishments and projects all in the book, so at least they'll all be together in one place. It's like Justin doesn't appreciate or even know what all I've done." I say, "Yeah, good idea. My father did that this year. He just wrote up a sort of autobiography of this year's doings and gave it to all of us family. It's kind of neat he's doing that. Guess he's getting old now and does what he wants to do no matter what other people think of it." (305 words)

I am traveling across the semi-desert badlands. I come upon a fighting circle of Indians. I am surrounded. It isn't my fight, but I am curious about the black feathers tied to the reins of a black horse. I recognize them and wonder if they belong to an Indian I know. I decide to steal the pony and leave the dangerous fighting area. An Indian, my friend, is mad at me for abandoning them there. I ride away and look out over the vista, miles and miles of, and I look forward to a long hard ride to another mesa where a town is. It's exploring time, vacation. I ride hard and long. As I approach the town, I get a phone call from Archie. He is upset with me and wants to talk, but he won't come to the point. I get off the horse and walk with him into the Parks and Rec building where we've danced contact improv before. He is near tears, very intensely upset and emotional. I am calm and caring and also wanting him to say what he really thinks. I am also a bit smiling because I think he won't admit that he, as the director, is upset because we are branching out on our own. He says, "I've heard that some dancers are "_____" and uses a word, a special dance term, that means "moving the move" in contact improv language. I smile and say, "And what's so wrong?" He won't really say. I never help him out by saying, "Yes, we've decided to try some dancing on our own, but that doesn't mean we are betraying you." It feels like he feels betrayed and abandoned. He walks a circle around me and around me as he talks. The carpet is uneven and makes it hard for me to keep my balance. Some people come in and interrupt, so I say, "Let's go into the next room." We do; it has a gym floor. I am relieved and say so. I can keep on my feet more steadily that way. Now we're semi-reclining on a couch. I have my hand sympathetically on his arm. He talks around the issue, but I wait for him to say, "I feel hurt and betrayed and I love you and you went off without me and I'm the director and you shouldn't do that to me." He then says he's been thinking of cutting Emery and Bonnie off soon anyway. I know that's just a defensive move and try to gently argue with him that that's not fair. (432 words)

I am reading a report that Millie made for me as her job as my publicist. It is too wordy and doesn't focus on what I want it to. She comes up all happy to see how I liked her report. I sit down and start explaining. I say, "It's great, really, but look, these first two sentences about men's voices and women working for democracy and motherhood, that's the first thing the people will read and this isn't what I'm trying to say. I want them to know about my creativity and my works." She explains why she thought that was a good idea and why she started the report that way. Then I point to the picture of Ellie and Charla and a bunch of other people and say, "You spend pages talking about them and my relationship with them, but that's not the point. My creative projects are the point. People don't know this is my daughter and my granddaughter." Millie feels a bit defensive and I'm trying not to hurt her feelings. Now I watch a woman, like Sally Fields, all cute and perky, who is going into a big office place to retrieve a doll for her daughter. The man boss is asking her questions about her creative talents. She shrugs and says she's too busy with making this doll for her daughter. The man looks at the Raggedy Ann doll and sees it is well made and says, "How did you make that?" She says, as she struggles to put the good one up on the window with sticky stuff on the forehead, "I just saw the pattern and then made it." The man is impressed with her skill, but the woman isn't even focusing and doesn't realize she has any talent. (298 words)

Fred Astaire is married to another woman. But it isn't working out. I like him and am trying to encourage him to break from old patterns. He is shy and used to routine. There are a bunch of teens he is trying to teach. They are surly and unruly. I am going to go to the opera with Fred, and as we walk down a hall, I hug him, leaning him up against the wall and cuddling. He feels a bit strange and doesn't respond, although he likes it. He is after all still married to the other wife even though he doesn't love her any more. Now we're in the auditorium. He's being loving and trying to encourage the teens. Women are talking about me behind my back. I interrupt them and try to involve them in some sort of gesture game. They start to like me a bit more. Off in the distance, the actors are singing away. Now it's a sort of prison and the guards are after the teens and Fred. I call him Freddie. I sneak into a room where I see Freddie's things arranged like at an altar, only it's at a small sink, few metal round things and some seashells. I decide to put a few of these things down the garbage disposal, realizing he'll probably be upset with me, but somehow this will be more safe for him if I get rid of these things. Only I realize that metal things in a garbage disposal are noisy and will not stop being ground up so it will call attention to the room. I feel a bit stupid. I should have realized that before I plopped them in. (285 words)

I have a lot of boxes and bags, of groceries and things. I see Curtis Salgodo and he's telling someone that his brothers have decided not to play with him any more as backup band. He'll have to go on alone or with a new backup band. I go up to him and say that I know he can do it, because many years ago, when I began my Masters program, I first saw him with the Night Cats (which should be Nighthawks). He begins to chat with me. I am very pleased, as I am a big fan and in awe of him. He is being nice and interested in me. He asks what my disability is. I say Rheumatoid Arthritis and talk about how I was walking then and danced all night with a brace and a cane. I realize I am building the story a bit, to get him to be in awe of me, or maybe feel a bit sorry for me and hang around a bit more. (172 words)

I am driving a car up a windy mountain road and park it next to my father's car as he was coming down the road. We are way off in the hills where scruffy hillbilly people live. I see an old rundown house and remark, "I've seen this kind of house before, as in my childhood, maybe living in them." I go in and a man and a woman, the sister to the woman who lives in the house, is being critical and judgmental. She doesn't like the way her sister does things and is telling her. The sister is angry and not responsive. I act as a negotiator and say to the sister "Look, you hit first. So of course, she has to hit back." The sister doesn't understand that her negative critical remarks are as harsh as attacking physically. (141 words)

I am either on a campus, or in an apartment building, in a long hall and Lucy is arrogantly snotty and angry. She yells swear words at the office people. I walk her outside and down a long, rickety ramp. I hear a commotion and look back. The narrator is telling about how it's a very hot day and the animals, especially the big ones, are very irritable. An elephant goes crazy with the heat, which is bad news for the little trainer man. I muse that maybe I should, in my retirement, take on the part-time job of coordinating the disability resources because the different resources offices are in different places and are not run smoothly. I'm mildly interested. Now I hold a big, cream-colored, furry cat and let go of it and expect it to land on its feet and walk away, but the cat is lazy or something and lands painfully on its belly. I drop it again and it does the same thing. I grimace with sympathetic pain and consider the cat rather slow-brained. I go outside and see Howard getting into a box, which is a sort of car. I wait for his wife to get in next. I don't want to get in too early and be alone with him. I put the cat in and wait impatiently for the wife, who comes out arrogant and snotty. (233 words)

I am visiting a house owned by a nice-looking man. His current girlfriend is moving out and he is now interested in me. I take a tour of the house, which has magnificent views all around of mountains and so on. The house is set up to give you a roller coaster ride effect as you walk around. I enjoy the thrill of walking across a wooden bridge between two rooms as it tosses and jiggles like in an earthquake. Now I am washing dishes in the kitchen sink and he's drying them. He is playfully flirting and there is pleasant sexual tension between us. Rena sits next to us and I ask, "What does she do?" He says, "She sits there and looks pretty." I think that is a bit condescending and feel bad for Rena. But I ignore it and continue talking with him. Now he's a very rich man and I am taking him a note I wrote with a joke on it. I am leaving him, sort of to prove I'm not after his wealth and I am my own woman, independent and so on. He reads my card, which says something about "May the Buddha follow you," or something like that. He looks at it and I giggle at him saying, "You don't get it, do you? You don't know what the Buddha is." I take the card to a man in the next room to share this great joke with him. I think his name is Howard. I say, laughing, "And he doesn't even know what the Buddha is!" (265 words)

I am prospecting for gold in a desert-like area. Lots of men are there. One man, like Christopher Reeves, is in love with me. I love him too. He wants us to get married. I love him, but am not willing to marry. I want my independence. We strike it rich. I say to him, "I have something I have to talk to you about." He says, frustrated, "I can't talk about it any more. I say, "It's not about that! This is something else you probably won't like to hear." I smile at him gently like it's a joke, only it's not. Now he is seated in an easy chair and I am kneeling in front of him, my head on his chest, my arms around his chest between his legs, hugging him. He is aroused and says sexily and lovingly, "You're on my heaven. Let's get married." I say, sleepily or slowly, "How about you stay here and work the claim for a year while I go away, and travel, and then I'll return and you travel for a year and I'll work the claim." He is deeply hurt and sad because that would mean we are apart. I feel a bit guilty about asking this. The scene shifts and I have chosen to run away. I go out into the desert and want to die. I lay down with dead beetles and a video camera and am going to wait until I dehydrate, but somehow I survive for years. Now a woman comes and says to me, "I know you want to die, I'm sorry to bother you, but...." and I say, "No, I've decided not to die. Help me." She helps me back home to the claim. I am exhausted, dehydrated and older. I come into the house, which used to be a cabin he and I shared. Now there are children and babies of his, sleeping in beds, and lots of furniture. I am sad, but I am happy for him. He comes to me hesitantly. He still loves me deeply. I know I hurt him badly. I say, "I do love you. I'm sorry I hurt you. Is it too late?" He hugs me and I know we will be together. (377 words)

I live in an apartment which I apparently share with roomies. I am unhappy. Something has happened or I am wondering deeply what I should be doing with my life. I choose not to go to work or school or wherever I usually go on weekdays. I decide I need to drive to Dover, which means go visit Ginny. Bonnie comes in. I think maybe I'll go across the street and visit Derek, later. Bonnie and I go look for the kitchen. There are two complete kitchens next to each other. The back one is mine. I say to her, "See, even if the roomies want to be cooking at the same time as us, we have our own kitchen." Bonnie likes that. I tell her I'm going to Dover. She leaves. For some reason I am hesitating and not leaving. I don't really want to go to Dover or to visit Derek and I do want to all at the same time. Now the house is crowded with roomies in the living room and I wonder where I can go to be alone. I find a back bedroom and go in. At first it is small and has a couch or two, not very pleasant. I then see there is more to it and follow it back to a comfortable sitting room with burgundy flounce curtains and a stereo speaker system that makes the music sound grand. I sit; it is nice. Then I decide to go see Derek. Maybe it will help. But I also don't want to go. Mateo goes with me. We drive to his corner and We get out and I realize there is a window display I'd never seen before, bottles with colored water in them. I see now I'm not at Derek's house; I'm a block too soon, on 14th and Ferry, not 15th and Ferry Street. I feel a bit silly to have made this mistake. We go back to get in the truck (pickup or VW bus) to drive to his house. (341 words)

I am startled and pleased, but don't know quite what to do or think, because it was so clear this wasn't going to be a part of our relationship. I can't quite believe it all. I wait, hugging him slightly to see if this continues or if it was just a "stray" kiss. He continues, obviously now indicating we will be lovers. (94 words)

My mother is indifferent and insists I leave the house, even though I am in emotional shock from some event. I see a couple standing in a cold lake up to their chest. They are uncomfortable. I see another couple, fully dressed standing in a very hot lake. They are enjoying the hot tub-like feeling but XXX a picture book which requires the page to be placed in a machine so it projects the story like a movie. The lace curtains and the black velvet drapes keep getting in the way. The wind is blowing them toward the area I'm working. A man tries to help me. He's sort of a Michael Bolton fellow, but very shy. I tuck several of the lace curtains outside the open window and the strong wind sucks them out and I see them land on the lawn. We are on the second story floor. I see the wind blow one across the lawn. I call out, "Oh, the curtains." The man goes down to retrieve them for me. As we are going down, he is very shy and nervous because as a shy man he's afraid to approach women, to date, so he's going to practice approaching the little girl. I say to him, "You have your best friend with you (some other man) and I am a very good friend. You'll be all right." I feel a bit jealous because I am the mother of the girl and I want the man to like me. (252 words)

I had been reading or watching a long story about this pioneer man and how he was so upset about the bad treatment of Indians. He wants to go out and fist fight every one who is calling him squaw man. But a woman says, "Don't waste your energy. Ignore them." Now I am a woman and I walk up to a seated Indian man, who is wearing an 1890's kind of black jacket, like Wyatt Earp would have worn, white man's clothes. He's the foreman. He calls out the black woman I will have as a slave. He hands me the white, little plastic bag which has her documents in it. It's her "freedom" bag. I take it and hand it to her. I say, "Elizabeth. I give you your freedom." She doesn't understand. She thinks I'm firing her and she'll be alone and poor. I say to her, "You are your own woman now and I'd like to hire you. I will pay $6 a week." The Indian man shows me a picture. It has a bright spotlight in the center and a sidelight where he's standing. He says, "I'm in the side light because I'm an Indian. I've always wanted to be in the center spotlight." I say to him, "I understand. Believe it or not, I am in the sidelight too, because I'm a woman with a disability. We get the same kind of discrimination." [BL] (239 words)

I get a phone call from a man trying to sell me a modem for my computer. The connection is very bad. I can barely hear him. The phone I hold has a round ring of lights that light up when it rings. A woman's voice says: "Your phone is ringing. Please press 4." I may not have pressed the right button or something but the guy's voice keeps cutting out. He's a rude and insistent man. I say to him firmly, "I'm not interested" as well as a confused message that I can't hear him well or the connection is bad. He says, "Shit," and tries to keep me on the line. I hang up on him, saying to my woman roommate, "Boy, he sure isn't good at this." She says, "Come out here and look at the flowers growing on the porch." I am annoyed. I'm very tired and sleepy and it's hard to walk, but she wants us to share some time together and the flowers are a way to do that. I allow her to push or lead me out, even though I don't really want to. (191 words)

A man with an odd face, like it has cake makeup or something on it, is intensely and single-mindedly attracted to me. I try to get away from him politely. He follows. He is a son of a king or a millionaire, but he acts goofy like an idiot. I am embarrassed by him and I'm also feeling sort of warm and attracted because of his vulnerability. He is so out there with his love for me. He pursues; I dodge; he persists. Later, there's a statement or question, "How is it like to be a gangster?" "They both have leading hose and bands." He also has a father who is just like him who is attracted to an older woman, perhaps my mother. He intensely woos her. He also tells his son that it may be too late. He (the son) may have failed his mission, which was to convince a general to give him armies and so on so they could defend their kingdom. I want to help him as he's almost got the general convinced. We could still do it. (183 words)

I am working for MIUSA. We are at a camp someplace. A woman with CP wants to show me something. We walk up a long rickety flight of stairs at the back of a building, go in, and walk down another flight, go across the building and out the door. She trips several times, nearly falling. She is very happy because she's been given permission to adopt a young disabled girl. She's taking me to see her. I haven't a clue why we had to go through that empty barn first. Now I'm leaving. The camp trip is over and I get a gift box sent in the mail. I open it. It's from the crew at the Forest Department. I had stayed at their office building and they so enjoyed my charming personality they wanted to give me a gift. I am very touched. It's a large logging truck, but no logs, just little cubicles to put cute little miniature knickknacks in. It is filled with little things. Behind it is a knickknack holder in the shape of a doll house and had oodles of miniature furniture and things in it. I'm very pleased. Now someone comes in with bad news to tell me. Charla comes in and sits on my lap. She is very sad. I ask her what happened. She says, "Henry the 16th has died." I at first don't remember who that is. Then I remember it is my daughter Ellie's good friend that Charla loved so much she named her kitten after her. I rock Charla, being soothing and also thinking, "Well, I thought the bad news was going to be bigger than that, maybe a national tragedy." I am a bit let down. Some other counselor comes up to say goodbye and we talk about the young woman with CP. I say, "It's so amazing. Here she can barely walk across the room without hurting herself and yet she has just the right loving skills to help her adopted child. It's a beautiful contradiction. (340 words)

Derek and I are returned from someplace. He has taken me home and he comes over to hug me and slowly the hug evolves into us making love, only it never is acknowledged we are making love. He lies on me with his back to me and sneaks his penis into me backwards. It is not hard, but the catheter tube helps it feel hard and it is a good sexual feeling. I lightly touch him on his bare shoulders and sometimes sneak a kiss on his neck or shoulder. Charla is nearby. I don't want her to see us and know we are making love. It is not appropriate and OK for her to know this/see this. Then he begins to move back and forth quickly and he has had an orgasm. That is very unusual for him, as he is a para. He sighs, relieved. I tenderly lie with him. I'm not sure if I had an orgasm or not. (162 words)

I have moved to another house and visit my old house, which now is lived in by Harriet. I see the Saturday newspaper on the porch and I say to her, "I'll take the paper." I pick it up and start to leave. I then realize that it is her paper. She pays for it. So I go back and give it to her, apologizing. I just wasn't thinking. Now I am going to my new place and I go through the college. I ask directions and the young woman says, "You go to the back of the building, take the elevator up to the 4th floor, and then return to the 3rd floor." It seemed an odd, out of the way to go and I only have three minutes to do it in. I start to run, but it is very difficult for me. I end up laying on the sidewalk, pulling myself along. I struggle. I know I won't make it. I'm not sure which path through the fair will get me there the quickest. Some paths meander or dead end. I find a sign and hear circus music and follow that. I get to the elevator area, but now there is a man I am in relationship with and he is playful and loving and wants to have fun and make love, and I laugh and say I have to do these things. I think I am picking up clothes and cleaning things. A little girl like Charla is around somewhere. It will be fun to get the work done and relax into the lovingness of my partner. I look forward to it. He is very desirous of me letting go of the work now and just having fun with him. There are tough guys like bikers somewhere in the background. They like me too. (308 words)

A man is talking to me. We are in a space where there is a double bed and an empty bookshelf, with old newspapers covering it up. I decide to go to bed and I crawl up the shelves and claw my way through the old newspapers to get to the shelf. I have a hard time, but finally get curled up on a shelf. It is uncomfortable. I cover myself with the newspapers, which look like the magazine pages for my collage art. The man is in the bed and he wants to get up and get something and apologizes to me for not being covered. I see his penis as he bends down to get something. He wants to know why I don't come to bed where it's more comfortable. I explain that Howard had been there so long that I'd gotten used to sleeping up on the shelf. It was better that way than be with Howard. I realize that I'd rather be in the bed even though this strange man is there and start to get off the shelf to go to bed. We'll just have to work out our relationship with each other after I get there. (202 words)

I am seated on a stone staircase in a huge palace. It is near the bottom stair. Derek and another woman are tickling and giggling over in a corner. I am smiling and feeling good about being who I am and not jealous or bothered by their play. Now I get up and walk back unexpectedly into my bedroom. I find Derek and the woman there making love in the bed, only I don't really see the woman, just Derek, fully clothed lying sideways on my single bed. I am furious and tell him off and spin on my heel to leave. He says, "No, please. Stay and talk with me." I laugh angrily and walk out. I want to walk off my anger by going as fast as I can up the staircase until I have gone as far and as high as I can go in this stone palace. I walk and walk until there is a huge stone wall or boulder stopping me. I peek in a crevasse or crack and can't see anything. Then there is an earthquake and everything around me falls until I am alone on a high, thin sliver of rock left from the palace. Then the scene shifts and the earthquake didn't happen and I am on the stairs and decide to retrace my steps down. A guard finds me and he's going to show me the way out, only now he takes me to the sultan's private quarters. I am impressed. I see women and one has a baby and she lets me hold it. While I am holding it, it relaxes and takes a nap. The sultan is near and I'm not sure if it's him or not, but bow and say, "Your highness," just in case. He and his wife are introduced to me. He kisses my hand and I see his fat, double-chinned face and his fat lips. He kisses me several times. He seems to like me. I go back to where the women are and return the sleeping baby and follow the guard out, only to find myself suddenly led into the harem and I realize I've been tricked. He intends to keep me forever.

I am in the back seat of a car. My brother Jake is with me. My father is driving. I am looking out the right side window (like a child might) and I see a dropoff. It's pretty, with snow, but a steep dropoff. I look to my father. I see we're on a gravel/dirt road. I tell him he's driving too close to the edge. It's dangerous. He laughs and deliberately jerks the wheel so we are even closer. I am annoyed. We drive through town. It does not look familiar, but yet it is my town. We are going to a nursing home to visit "Aunt Marya." When we get there, I realize we're at an ice rink. I say, "Hey, I thought we were going to a nursing home to see Aunt Marya." She walks by, a very old woman, and I feel embarrassed she heard me because she obviously doesn't need a nursing home. I've insulted her. Someone says, "Let's play ice hockey." "Right!" I say. "So is the ice rink wheelchair accessible?" I was sarcastic. Now I see Aunt Millie and Lydia. I am very excited and happy to see Aunt Millie. We all now have on ice skates. Aunt Millie is on my left and Lydia on my right, supporting me as I fumble and slip. We get on the ice, but the ice is really crowded with people and cafe tables and chairs. There are rectangular cuts of ice where the ice is chips and there is water under it. I must avoid all these obstacles. In addition, at the far right end is a heated swimming pool, and it's hard to avoid sliding right into it. But I manage and now I'm skating alone and Millie and Lydia are seated watching me as I come around. They smile and applaud. I feel quite accomplished now and gather up speed. More rectangular cuts are made and the ice is incredibly chopped up, and yet I continue to skate well. (336 words)

I am swimming across a milky glacier-like lake. My hands and arms are straight and powerful. I am impressed with how easily I am doing this without getting tired or scared. I notice my legs are not moving, so I try and use them too. It is a bit awkward. I get out on the other side. Ernie and Ginny are coming over. I notice I'd better be on my toes and do things right if Ernie is around. I mail a letter. Later, he has a letter to be mailed, but it doesn't have a stamp on it. I help Ginny get a stamp on it.

I want to change my clothes, so I go down a series of flights of stairs to a room where I had stored some clothes. I walk in to see a couple on the floor almost starting to make love. They stop abruptly at my entrance. I smile and say, "Just a moment. Sorry. I need to get some clothes." They smile and say, "No problem," but of course I know they can't wait for me to leave so they can get on with it. I open drawer after drawer and can only find summery clothes from Mexico, gauzy material, bright colors, a bit revealing and sexy. I am aware I am too fat to wear them. I check the next chest of drawers and find them full of papers and Kodak film boxes, nothing to wear. Oh well. Now it is time to leave, and at the last minute I decide to clean up some mess I've left -- paper scraps, some tiny knitted or crocheted stocking hats, tiny yarn doll bodies and so on. Now I leave the room, thinking I should probably take the one chest of drawers that is mine and its contents back up to where I was. I feel tired and decide not to. I don't need that stuff anyway. The couple is very glad I'm leaving, but pretending to be polite. I say as I walk out the door, "I'm not stupid, you know." They grin. (I think there were mentally retarded people upstairs I was working with.) (255 words)

I have a personal assistant named Mary who is mentally retarded, short and chubby. She keeps talking all the time and doing things wrong, like holding the shampoo bottle upside down and not noticing the shampoo is running out all over her clothes. I ask her to help me take a bath. I am in the tub in my clothes, she has gotten my wallet wet and is trying to fix it and she is nonstop talking. I finally say to her, "Damn it, Mary, you're fired. I know you mean well and you're a hard worker, but you keep making mistakes." She gets in the tub with me and is trying hard to convince me not to fire her. I insist she get out. Finally I call Nancy in, who is visiting. She and Charlene are out in the living room talking. I explain to Nancy why I'm firing Mary and ask her to get her out of my tub. Nancy says, "OK," gets her out and then says, "I'm not the one to be telling this to." I agree, saying, "Sorry, I guess I was just ventilating." I wonder if this was such great timing, firing her when I was in the tub, a vulnerable spot for me. I also feel a bit concerned because now I have to find someone else. Maybe Charlene will work for me again. I think, "After all, she's been volunteering here for a while, so maybe she's got time again and wouldn't mind making $6 an hour." She is telling Nancy she just got one of her plays produced. (267 words)

I am being forced to marry a man by some irresistible force, possibly alien or spiritual. I try to escape. I do not want to be married. I don't even know the man. I get in an elevator and it starts to go sideways across University campus to the site of the wedding. I try to stay in the elevator but I am forced out, by some force I cannot see. There is no escape. I am now in a wedding dress, the wedding party is there and it is happening even as I fight it. I feel powerless. I don't want traditional marriage. It sets women back generations. (109 words)

I am at some shop and notice a house next door. Many Asian and colored people are going in, many of them very distinctively dressed in costumes that are highly colorful, quilted or poofy and ornate. It's a church of some kind. I go over and lean on the fence in front of the house to watch. Now members of the church are tossing some of the people out over the balcony, some of them dropping or falling three stories. I am concerned that they will be hurt with broken bones, but they are not. These members are being ritually thrown out or rejected. Now Dora joins me. I want to take pictures, but I am out of film. I take an iron and smooth out a rectangle of sawdust, the medium used to take pictures with, even though I know it won't do any good. Now Dwight comes up and says, "Come on, we're all going now to pick out a present I'll buy for each of you." I say, "Great, but not right now, because I want to see this." He leaves. I continue watching. A few minutes later, Dora and I go to find Dwight. Maybe it's too late to get our gift. Dora shows me an ornate decorated cake she made for the contest. It has sort of a blue ribbon design on it. I say, "It's very pretty." I don't find Dwight. (237 words)

I am talking to a man about how crazy making it is to work in crowded conditions. I tell him about registration at the community college and how each year it got more crowded. I see Tyler telling Charlene one of his stories and smile because I know she has heard it many times. I wonder if she will just stoically listen or what. She finally interrupts him and says she has heard it before. She leaves and he smiles sheepishly. Now the man comes into my bedroom. I think I am rooming in his house. His son is upstairs. He is a quad and the man is crying as he tells me that today the assistant can't come today and he will have to be left alone. I offer to call in sick at work and stay to help him, but it would mean moving him downstairs and I couldn't transfer him. The man is grateful. [BL] (157 words)

I am the head resident of a sorority and we are having a party. I am dressed up in a lovely long skirt and blouse. I walk up the flowing stairs and around watching. Now the men are arriving. Someone says, "Oh, oh. It isn't good to just open the dance to any man off the street." I see quite a crowd of them streaming in. They are rowdy and I am more busy being vigilant. I go to my quarters and get the key to the front door from my purse and hide my purse and then put the key in my pocket. Now Anddrea comes in and a shy young man named Ted. Andrea begins to work with him as a counselor. There is an audience of students watching. He is shy and we both encourage him to tell his dream. Andrea lays down next to him talking in soothing accents. He begins to tell the dream and then interrupts himself and says, "Oh, I get it. The answer is money. I need to make lots of money with my writing." Some man smiles and gently shakes his head no. (192 words)

I am going back to school to take a class. I can't seem to find the class I want to take. I wander around the buildings. Now I am in a class, a sort of business class. Another student, a woman, and I are a team. She is to place a box on the floor in the exact position as in the book. I notice that no matter where we place it, it's not quite right on the bottom side. I try adjusting my position to see if it makes a difference. Someone says I have excellent spatial perception. I am surprised because I don't, usually. I decide this is a boring class and wander around noticing other classes. I pass the animal biology classes and don't like them. I find myself in the film media classes, big classes lots of students, cute instructors. I am interested. I decide I'll get into one of those. Now I want to go home, but I can't find an exit door that works. Two men students follow me upstairs and try to open conversation. I ask them how to get out. They take me back downstairs, which is hard in my manual wheelchair. They are impressed with me and say they have a room I could rent in their boarding house. I say, "I've already got one, thanks." I finally get out and head home. A piano tuner is tuning the old square like piano I had found in the basement for me and it has been moved up to the living room. The landlady gives me and my male friend a lecture about being always late for meals and we will get cold meals if we keep this up. I look outside and see my small brother, maybe 5 years old, wandering away toward the big lake. I am concerned and run after him to retrieve him. I see him get into a rowboat with several other boys and head out for deep water. I tell my younger sister she must go back and tell my father and get help. She cries that she is afraid she will lose her way and not know the turns. I grab her by the shoulders and say with confidence, "You are a smart girl. You will know the right way." She goes. I run across the rice paddy-like area, then over the beach sand and then into the water. Just then I see the small plastic rowboat and yank my brother out of it after some confusion about which one was my brother. I give him what for, lecturing him at how surprised I was that he would not heed our dead mother's words about always being honest. Other people come to retrieve their little boys and I learn they had been going around begging for money and collecting some. I am handed some plastic spoons as his share of the take. I want to return it to the rightful owners, but have no way to do so so. I walk my brother back toward home, continuing to say I am so surprised at him. He cries and I hug him saying, "But now you learned a lesson and won't do it again. (538 words)

A woman is dating the principal of a school. He is coordinating or producing some kind of talent show. She is sort of cool or taking him for granted. Another woman comes in, short, tightly curled black hair, very sexy in a silky, black, short dress. He is very attracted to her and the first woman gets a bit jealous. The sexy woman looks down and notices her breasts are exposed. She pulls the black jacket, a man's jacket, up around her to cover herself. She still looks sexy. She's interested in the man, and wanders around his school room looking at things on the desk and walls, so she can get a feeling for who he is. There are lots of pictures he drew that make her think he's an architect because all the forms are separated out like on a schematic. Later, I see some of the talent acts doing their thing, but the school desk is in the way of the camera and he has to decide to do it again or not. He wants it to be a good job, so he begins again. Now I am a woman and I notice he has given to the first woman some gifts in a plastic bag. One of the gifts is a small diary with the name Barb Sanders written on the cover. I wonder if he gave her my book which I gave him. That doesn't feel good. I leaf through it, feeling guilty I'm spying. Then I see many black velvet wrist watches all over my left arm. I suddenly realize that back in 1986 when I traveled to Russia with MIUSA that everyone wanted to not wear their watches because in the late afternoon it was hot and humid, so I agreed to hold them for them, and I accidentally didn't get them returned. I feel bad, but it's too late now. The first woman tries on a couple of them she likes. (329 words)

Two men and I are traveling to T City to visit Dora again. I had visited lately and it was very enjoyable. The one man is sort of Derek but is sort of Kyle, but I call him Dwight, although it seems to me his name may be something else. The other man is his younger brother and is pretty much Kyle's younger brother, the one that molested Charla. I ask what vehicle we are in and he says it's their Dad's vacation camper. It is a square box-like thing with tiny kitchen appliances. I try to explain how to get to Dora's new place, called Paradise Cove, but I can't remember, so I am trying to read the maps. I can't seem to find T City on the map and I try repeatedly. Now the younger brother says, "I'm exhausted from driving; it has cramped me up," and I look at the other brother who says, "I can't, I'm too tired." I say, "Maybe I can, is it power steering and brakes?" "Yes." I try to steer, but it is a small crank handle and isn't very responsive. We are getting nowhere fast. (194 words)

Theresa/Cherokee is driving a pickup and I am the passenger. I see us driving very fast across the canyon to get to the event. We overslept. I see her dark hair very clearly; she is vibrant and pretty. I see my gray hair. Now I arrive with my little girl. We'd been in such a rush we hadn't taken time to eat breakfast or take my pills. I walk, holding the girl in my arms. I find my yellow pill box and take the pills, only the vitamin, the calcium, and the hormones. I put them aside, sort of checking if I had enough to make it through the stay. Now I see the group, singing is over and someone already moved the pickup. I am looking for some breakfast. I choose the left hall and open a door to see a smoke-filled room with an annoyed woman in it. I apologize because I hadn't realized this was now someone's private living quarters. I now go down the hall on the right. I see an Indian woman who gives me $1.10 in tokens as I can't find my purse. I assure her I'll pay her back. She says, "Go to the farmer's wife. She still has breakfast." I say, "Is this enough money?" She smiles at my concern. I find the farmer's wife and am asking the girl what she would like to eat.

Darcy is trying to sneak into my father's car to use it to go somewhere. My father and I are nearby and ask her what she thinks she's doing, like we caught her red-handed. She explains she wants to go and talk to a girl who was sexually abused and explain to her that it's OK to tell people. She didn't know that when it happened to her and wants to encourage the girl. I feel bad I was so negative and suspicious of her and say shyly, "I wish you would talk about it more to me. I'd like to know more." She is friendly, but somehow avoids telling me anything. Now I want to go see an old wooden sidewalk I used to walk as a child. I find it and walk it to the end and admire the wooden panels folded up at the end. The wood is beautiful. Now a bunch of people are there and I am telling the man operator of the sidewalk my story of how we'd come here to meet my father and then go swim (my brother and me) off the end of the sidewalk. This was somewhere near N City. It was a happy, nostalgic memory and the people are all gladdened to hear it. They want to videotape the cute story for publicity. I let them. Later I'm asking my mother what my father wants for his birthday present. She shows me pies and cakes and finally some chocolate fudge. I choose the fudge, it's easier to take along. Darcy gives him a cute child's video with mermaids on the cover. I had given him one entitled "Bambi's King" or something like that. It had a sweet cover of lots of little girl mermaids seated around. He is very happy and I ask him, "Why the mermaids?" He says the photo reminds him of a group of women campers and he wants to use the photo to create some photo story of a past happy event. (337 words)

I am a beautiful young woman like Audrey Hepburn, in a basic black dress, black heels and all the men watch me as I walk with grace and elegant beauty. Women are in a line and going down a steep cement stairway, no sides or rails. We then step into the water, which is thigh deep. We each come to a small water faucet like fountain and bend and take a drink. It is some ritual. As it is my turn, I see an old woman sneak in and take my turn. I graciously let her, even holding down the push button to let the water flow. Then I bend to take my drink. The woman whose turn would be next shoves me away saying, "I gave up my turn when I let the old woman drink." I disagree and try to take my drink. She keeps shoving me, so I turn and fight her, socking her in the face and knocking her down. The watching men really like and admire my feisty attitude. But the woman, her name is Betty, hates me now and keeps relentlessly coming after me. I fight her again and escape to my small black convertible sports car. She chases me through the city streets. Finally I outfox her by turning into a very narrow alley between two huge stone houses. It is a steep incline. Betty is driving a big car so she doesn't fit. Now she has friends and is walking down toward me. I tap on the small ancient glass windows, but no one responds. I pick up my black cellular phone and call 911. Sympathetic cops ask where I am and I try to describe it, then I drive away and Betty still pursues. My roads are disappearing; then I have to drive up a dirt hill, and then a sand-filled, half paved road where construction is going on. I can't seem to find a main road to get back to the city. Lots of water is pouring down on one sandy road like they are constructing stuff. (347 words)

I am in an airplane going home and am traveling with a disabled man. We somehow find or went to look at property that could be a nice place for him to live and an OK investment. Somehow the plane returns and we get off and agree and sign papers to buy this property, and now we are flying home. A man like Loren C. comes out of a room, sleepy like he just woke up and he is shivering. He greets a tall, sharp-faced man who looks like John, my therapist. He calls him "Omni" as in Omnipotent, the leader, a joke. Loren says he didn't realize the cabin they bought was so primitive and cold. He is unhappy with recent purchase. I am startled to realize I bought some property also. It is so isolated and out in the eastern Washington high desert. What was I thinking? "John" sits next to me and says, "Can you love me?" He is in love with me. I smile and say, "I like you." He has his shirt off and puts his arm around me. We kiss and then he says, "I see, you don't love me." The kiss was very uninteresting and neutral. He will wait, hoping. We arrive back. I am looking at a bunch of map- like papers he gave me. I decide I will visit him, since on the paper is a sort of puzzle where when you read the words he asks me to visit his home. But I can't figure out where it is, somewhere in Washington. Later, Loren won't talk to me as he's mad because he doesn't like the property. I am about to leave and he calls me over to smile and say it's not your fault I had different expectations. I thank him for telling me that. I feel relieved of my guilt. The scene shifts and I've built a beautiful home on the property, which has a river on it. My bedroom is partly submerged in the river, built with Plexiglas corner so I can see the river life underneath. I wake up, afraid for a moment because some huge-eyed thing is staring at me through the glass. After my fright, I appreciate the beauty of this view. John is in the other room and somehow I know we are a mere ten miles from a big city, even though I am out there in the boondocks. (407 words)

I am sitting on a small back porch up a flight of stairs. From my place, I can safely watch the bull riding events. One Brahma bull is mad as hell and his hair knot on his back stands straight up. He's running through the crowd and nearly getting people. Now a bull rider is on him and a cowboy on a horse. I trying to rope him. I am amazed that two events are being done simultaneously. Now the bull rider, a very charming, good-looking man, is walking toward the house. He is talking with his pal. I watch as he almost decides to go up my back stairs, then turns and goes back around to the front door. I am going to make a pudding and ask my father to bring me a mixer. Now another good-looking cowboy comes up my back stairs. He is Rod Taylor. He stops to flirt and chat. He talks about his pain and I tell him I have RA. We talk happily, obviously flirting and liking each other. He asks me if I always stay up here, and I say mostly. I'm not stupid. If I was down in the crowd, I could get hurt and not see so well. He is mixing up some pain relief balm that smells good. We are very attracted to each other, a promising love affair. (230 words)

Ellie is going to do a strip tease in a contest. She's the first one up. She is 200 lbs. and confident. She gets up on the platform, which is a rickety series of platforms. She begins. I call to Ginny, who is in the other room trying to phone her husband. I save her a seat. There are lots of college kids on bleachers, then my wheelchair and one armchair. I stand up in the armchair and Ginny sits in the wheelchair. I feel a bit embarrassed for Ellie because she's so fat and so enthusiastically naive. But she's doing OK. The crowd is very quiet and nonresponsive. In the middle of her strip, her platforms shift and she falls between two of them with one leg. It throws her off a bit, but she comes back, very plucky, to try again, I can see the platforms are very precarious. She tries again and quickly slips again. This time she lands on the floor on her back, breaking a small drawer. She lays there, annoyed.The crowd is curiously noncaring. I call out, "Are you all right?" She says, "Yeah, but it's over." The next fat woman comes out. I notice she is pretty, as was Ellie, even though very fat. (211 words)

I would like to do sex, but as soon as he's in the picture, everything shuts down in disgust. Later I pass a medical test which proves I have quick and normal arousal responses, but it's quickly interrupted by a shut down because of Howard. The test also confirms I am heterosexual, very heterosexual. Later, I am visiting Ginny and trying to take my pills and have breakfast. I'm having a hard time. (97 words)

I see a child, possibly Charla, going to school and realize a man with a gun is there in the crowd to harm the children. I am outraged and run through the crowd and hit him from behind, knocking him down and taking his shotgun. He gets up and runs, then turns and has a bazooka. He aims at me as I aim at him. We fire at the same time. I see the blue ball of fire and duck, so it only grazes my side. He is hit, but does not fall. We fire again and again. He walks toward me until I fire point blank into his belly. He finally dies. I am rewarded by being given the powers of a fairy. I am full-sized and me, but now I have cute wings and sparkle dust. I can fly and turn invisible. So I decide to get rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world. I decide to remove the nuclear waste buried in Washington on the reservation. I fly there, go invisible and cause all those barrels of radioactive material out billions of miles into outer space, being sure that it isn't on a path that will eventually drift into a planet and cause harm. I then must retreat as the men are looking for me. I try to fly away and realize this was a huge job and I am exhausted, my powers temporarily depleted. I can't turn invisible so I hide and wait for my powers to return, so I can take on the next nuclear task. (263 words)

I am a young Eleanor Roosevelt, my waist is slimming down, my pairs of thick glasses are the buttons I close my waist band with. My new husband notices I am looking more pretty and desirable. I go to take a bath and realize I have no privacy now, as it is the White House. The door to the bathroom is open and people could walk through. I realize I am naive and have much I should lean, so I don't accidentally embarrass the presidency. I try to gather up my pills that fell into the bathtub. Now I am picking up my things and see that a box of children's books aren't mine. Oliver North/Jerome sits behind me. He is called Colneral. He is dishonest and feels bad about it. (131 words)

I think I had been ill and am recovering. I want Charla to go to the Publications Dept. again and get me some copies of pictures of specific notables like Deepak Chopra and Dr. Spock and so on. I decide at the last moment to go with her. I'd just gotten my hair cut and it is brown and the bangs are curly. So I follow her out to the hall and we get the elevator. We get in and Charla, the little girl in the TV movie last night, who is precocious and has temper tantrums. She sees a backpack on the floor and says its her mommy's. Then she orders a few things off the back wall shelves. The attendant gets them for her; it's like a store. She had earned a few dimes during my illness running errands. The elevator goes up for a long time and then it goes straight like a car on an old road. The attendant says the department is now in the Brown Building downtown. I am quite surprised and think this is a good way to get a free ride downtown when I want to run errands. I'll just pretend I'm going to the Publications Dept. We get to a hallway. On the left wall are signs. The first one says "October Games Free Software Month." The next one says "Las Prunes Month." We get to the department and we go in. I say to a woman clerk, "I'd like Xerox copies of some pictures..." and she interrupts, "Now there's the problem. You have to pay for those copies and the person you pay is not here. He is on duty..." and she lists three times. I suggest we try and locate the pictures and then later I'd come back and make copies. I am annoyed. Earlier I was a bit amazed at how far the ride had been and a bit chagrined I'd sent the little girl there for errands so often. (332 words)

Richard R is inviting me to a snazzy party and is giving me directions to get there. It's not far away, but the directions seem complicated: four right turns in a row. I say, "But that depends on where the right turns start. I notice M. Street is right outside my door. I am wearing a blouse and no bra and the nipple of one breast peeks out. I try to cover it up. Now he decides to show me how to get there and we go out. I would go straight on M. Street but he points out ugly construction. That is terrible to go through construction, so he says, "We'll take this turn and take the shortcut." We are on a gravel road and I realize we'd made a turn and I didn't note the name of the corner or a landmark. How will I find my way again? But we are there now, and lots of round tables are set up with place settings and name tags and little gifts for each person. He says, "Remember, your place is _______," something that starts with a C. I wander around the crowded area looking for my spot. I finally find it way in the back, where it's the hardest to get to. I smile at the irony. Of course it would be so. But I have several books there waiting for me, special gifts. A woman is jealous. Now I am home and a young woman named Theresa and Richard R (now a woman) have a heavy discussion. Richard is the woman's daughter that gave the party. The mother is gravely ill. Theresa was adopted when she was in the 7th grade and the mother and she really talk and understand each other well. It is a good loving relationship and Richard is jealous, as he is the real blood daughter, but it isn't as deep or loving for him. Now a man named Larry (like Raul) comes in all intense and jovial and charming. I like him and want him to stay. He sees Theresa (now called Amy) and the mother at my house and sighs. He'd rather avoid them because it is such an emotional drain on him as he takes the clown caring role to cheer them up. He goes in to do that, as their brother is ill with AIDS and they are worried about him. I say to Larry as he comes out, "Where are you going?" He says, "Off to a summer vacation spot to have fun." I tell him I feel sadness for him as I wonder whose shoulder he cries on. Who takes care of him? He keeps me at a emotional distance and rushes away quickly. (457 words)

I, the dreamer, is watching a scene. I seem to identify with the married man. A woman and a man get married after a short, but loving, courtship. Soon after they are married, they begin to have misunderstandings and fights. They are always angry at each other and can't seem to reconcile it. They are miserable, yet they love each other. There is another man, an architect, who loves the woman and she goes to visit him. The jealous husband, who has another kind of career, follows her and comes into the house. The two men talk. The husband is angry and belligerent, but after a while the other man begins to understand that the husband is a good man, but hurt. So he helps the husband understand, and brings the woman and the husband back together, even though he still loves her. But now he is best friends with the husband and cares as much for him. The husband and the woman go out to the car to drive home when the woman's parents come to get in the back seat. They are argumentative and negative at the husband, who in his new-found understanding, doesn't tolerate it anymore. He tells them to shut up. The woman at first is upset and then understands that is right. She smiles at the husband. [BL] (222 words)

I am in a class, maybe writing class. A woman is setting up some sort of conference. She is taking special interest in making me comfortable. She gives me a notebook and papers and a candle and a potted plant and other amenities. I gather them up one by one with Charla's help and take them to my desk, but it takes up two desks worth of room. I'm the only one this is permitted with. Now it's time to go to the first activity. I get on a sailboat she is trying to drive. At first it won't budge from the dock, but then as she turns the wheel around and around. It starts to go, but the channel is very obstructed with things like wooden boxes and so on. We bump our way through them, she turning the wheel sharply from one end to the other. It fairly spun in her hands. We get off and walk down a path to a house. Inside the ceremonies are beginning. Each person has special duties or tasks to do. One man is reading a religious paper. Someone asks me, Where's my copy?" I say, "Oh, I left it on my desk. I already read it." Then I feel like I would like to join in with the man, reciting passages with him, but don't have my copy. Then a man in a wheelchair dressed in drag comes in. His mother tells him to go on back out and continue with the activity. He takes his black, curly wig off. He is partially bald. He feels a little silly dressed in women's clothes. (272 words)

A married couple are fighting. The man is cold and selfish. The woman may be Asian. I see a baby, their baby, fall off a high dock into an ocean. I am afraid for the baby. The mother sees it too and dives quickly off the dock into the waters. His granny did too, but she's more hindrance than help. I feel dread and fear as I hope I don't have to witness the drowning of this baby, and there is not a thing I can do to help. I watch as the mother strongly swims over to him and saves him, then let's him float underwater, teaching him to swim, so if this happens again, he will be safe. I am anxious and want her to bring the baby up to safe, dry land right now, but I realize her strategy is best. (144 words)

A rather stupid, lanky man is asking me questions. I hold a package with a small plastic bag of white beads in it. It is a beading kit. He asks me what the words on the package says. I say, "Stretched string beads." He asks how many beads there are. Are there enough to bead a whole shirt? I answer gruffly, "How would I know? It doesn't say." I am annoyed with his attitude and questions. The man says, "Why don't you lighten up?" I realize I am being sharp and grumpy, but I say, "Because I don't want to," which is true. This IS the way I feel and I don't want to change it right now. [BL] (118 words)

I am in the M City house, sleeping in my bedroom. I open my eyes and see my "dad" walking up to my open bedroom door. He is tall and lanky like Nate. He is so tall, his head is above the doorjamb. I feel fear. He is going to harass me. He then walks down the stairs to go to the bathroom. I sneak out of my room and run into my brother's room (actually the room my parents had). I crawl under the covers with one of my brothers trying to hurriedly pull up the covers over me. He's coming back up the stairs and I know a part of my shoulder may be visible. I know this won't work and I'll probably got my brothers in trouble too, but I stay there. He comes in and looks around. I think he sees me, but lets me be. He leaves. I go quickly back into my bedroom to the closet to try and change clothes before he comes back. As I pull a dress off a hanger, I am standing in the closet, which seems to have lots of room. A weird-looking girl comes and watches me. I tell her to go away. I pull on my dress, which I wonder if it is too fancy and will call attention to myself. I go downstairs to the kitchen where my mother is fixing French toast for breakfast. She wants me to do something and is grumpy. [BL] (248 words)

I am in a world where everyone else are aliens in human bodies like in the Body Snatchers. I can trust no one. Everyone else is emotionless and ready to get me. I run, driving my car. This goes on for a long time. Now I am staying at some man's house. I am sad and stoic, alone and getting on with it. My old lover comes by. I am in the back seat of a car. I think my mother is there too. The man is in the passenger side of the front seat. He is tall and lanky like Nate and like "Albert" of the movie, "Legends of the Fall" which I saw last night. He is sad and loving. He wants me back. I find it hard to resist, but I must. This is sweet and exquisite torture, to want to melt into his arms and yet feel compelled not to. He is looking around the car and trying to make small talk to keep me there, counting the number of paper cups there and so on. I smile saying, "There used to be more, before I cleaned up the car." He says, "Let me help you on with your coat." He does, and I let him. It is a poignant and slow motion move where he puts my arms into the coat like you would a child, and as I sit there with my arms out, letting him, my body and arms are in a gesture of opening up to embrace him. I feel great sadness and a desire to throw my arms around him, but I stoically hold still and let this moment pass. I get out of the car and walk back to the house. My "mother," a dark-haired woman is there standing on the sidewalk, being somehow derisive and putting me down. I walk past her. As I step up on the first step of the porch, I realize there is mud on my shoes, which are soled moccasins. I try to rub them on the indoor/outdoor carpet mat. My roommate, sort of a Bill R guy, comes out. I show him I am being a "good girl" and cleaning my feet off before coming in. He loves me too and smiles. The same feeling of sadness and stoic denial that love is impossible for me is there. As I scrape the mud off, I also accidentally scrape off the soles. He bends down gently to see the damage. He holds my foot and I see it is a small baby's foot in a silly sock, like the black one I have with red lip prints or kiss prints on it. He says he will get me some new shoes. I feel grateful, touched by his love for me. I fight to remain stoic and walk into the house. (476 words)

I interview for a job as a secretary for this college professor who has a terrible reputation as a womanizer who "feeds" on the young college girls. I am a sophisticated, together woman in white high heels and a business suit. I am also beautiful and tailored. I step through a room that might have been an old gym room in PE filled with a jumble of boxes and crates. I get to his office, which is also crowded with furniture and so on. My desk area is in the far back of the room, to the left as I walk in the door and all his stuff is to the right of the door. But the door opens to the side of the room, so as I sit at my desk and see him at his, facing me at the other end of the room, the door is on my right. He says to me in a jeering tone that he has his ways and if I can't handle being around it, then I need to leave. I smile and say calmly, "No problem." He hires me, now very curious about my calm and content demeanor. I do not disapprove of him or put him down, even though I don't believe what he is doing is right, but it is his life and I make no thought or attempt to try and change him. He feels that and is intrigued. I come to work the next day and clean my desk area. It is spotless, organized and ready for work in strong contrast to his area of cluttered furniture and so on. I sit, ready to work. He now wants to reform his ways and is falling in love with me and must earn my respect. I see two ugly rugs on his floor. He says, "I want new rugs. Go buy me some." I laugh and say, "Sure. What colors do you like?" He says patterns or designs. I write this down with a marker pen on an old rug piece tacked to the wall. He loves this because it is so unconventional. He says, "Maybe dandelions." I say, "Cute and fuzzy, or botanical?" He loves the way I banter matter-of- factly with him, not arguing or persuading him to anything I might prefer. I then go walking out to find the store. I come to the "main street" of the university area. A slick brick pattern is in the raised center of the road. I start to haul myself over the four-foot high raised area, throwing one leg over and scrambling, then I think, "This isn't going to work," and walk an extra block out of my way to the stairs over it. I go into the store. It is a huge area with many cubicles or desks where beautiful merchandise sits. People go sit at the desk/cubicle and admire different pieces as they decide to buy or not, lots of people. I see some exquisite glass vases and realize this is an auction or estate sale of very expensive material. I go to the back of the room to ask a clerk where are the carpets. He points off to a central area where I see bits of color. I then am distracted by other fine things to see. I decide I'll go see the carpets later. I brush against a cello case and it nearly falls. I catch it and put it back. Then I see what looks like tall, thin, fine, dark wood cabinets. I go to look, touching one that tumbles against the others, almost causing a chain reaction. The once thin case opens, as is a bass fiddle case. I get it all put back and am attracted to a revolving set of walls which have pillows hanging on them. I look and then move on to a table where there are books and cameras and so on. I pick up a fat book with a thick cellophane plastic cover. I see it is a working script book for a classic movie called "My Dear ____" (maybe wife). I am intrigued because I had chosen this movie to dissect to learn how to do a movie. The added attraction to the book is that there are special insider notes about how the "real" directors do it. I look at the price. $15.00 seems a lot. Then I see I got mixed up and that is the price of a book called Wizard of Oz. I then see the right price is $11.95. I decide it's worth it and take the book. Then I see a camera, a Lieka small portable. I turn it over and try to see the back. It says Polaroid. It was $132.00 dollars when new, but I can buy it for $12.00. I choose it too. Then I find an intriguing pottery piece. It is like a small compact vase to put food in like a snack tray. The beauty of it is that it unfolds so that the main vase part holds bread sticks and dip. The other petals fold out to create a trail of platters, each a different colored pottery to hold the veggies. It is adorable. I take it too. Later I take all this back to the office and show the man, who is now like Derek. He looks at the pottery piece and says, "Well, you'll have trouble with Charla. She'll want to play with it all the time." I say, "Oh well, I'll keep it anyway. I'll put it away when she comes to visit." He chuckles at me for getting so many things I like when sent on the mission of getting him a carpet. (which I also did get). (960 words)

A good-looking young man, maybe 29 years old, seems very charming. Dovre and I are attending some growth seminar. He joins us. Then, he starts exhibiting psychotic behaviors. He grabs a doll and holds it to his penis and pees on it, right in front of me, while smiling charmingly at me after he had just violently ravaged the doll. Then again he grabs my daughter, Dovre, as she is laying on the floor, only she becomes another doll. I grab the doll and say, "No. You can't." We wrestle over the doll and I force it away from him. He is intense and single-minded. I go over and whisper to the woman who is running the workshop, "We have a psychotic person here; get security." She leaves to do that. Then I see Paul C and two of his men who walk up to me nonchalantly. He says, "Where is he?" I look around. He had gone outside, to pee in the woods. I see him coming back toward the door. We are standing in the open door and he sees the big, obviously police men. He veers away and starts to walk away. I try to walk out to entice him back in a friendly manner, but he's onto us. I am annoyed at Paul and his men for being so obvious. A good-looking man, one of the security ones, only more feminine-looking and a slight build, says, "Maybe I can convince him to come over." I say, "You are probably right. I'm pretty sure he is homosexual and schizophrenic. Watch out for him, he is very charming on the outside and dangerous as hell." (277 words)

I am hearing a radio report about a new kind of ski lift that uses pressurized air to shoot the person straight up to the high place, and then it's a roller coaster kind of ride down. You lean backward on the air and ride down, fast and exciting. I'm up there, having done the first half of the ride. I look down and see Dovre, my daughter, laying on her tummy asleep, on a bench. I see one big crow or raven and four of five little ones sitting on her back. As she stirs, they fly up a bit and settle down on her again. I see the big one go sit on a boy's head. I know this is magic stuff, and realize the boy has been chosen by the raven, the wise one. I call to Dovre and tell her what I see, asking if she can see it too. I say, "There's a prairie chicken in the kitchen too." I see a top-knotted African kind of bird. They all look so real. I wonder if they can be seen by others and feel a slight fear that if they are real, they could just scratch or hurt the boy and Dovre. But I do know they are "dreams" or "other world." The spirits.

A woman director, dark-haired, and famous is on TV doing her regular show. I think her name is Carol Lawrence, or something like that. Her friend Lucille Ball decides she wants to come on the show as a surprise and tease her friend. She prepares by putting on ear muffs and two square boxes, one over each ear. She wonders for a moment if she should do this. Would people think it silly or untasteful? She decides to trust her instincts. She goes on, surprising the crew, and then Carol. It ends up being a classic touching and humorous bit that people found endearing. (104 words)

He tries to describe this insightful moment to Jack Benny. He reaches over to a lamp, which is in the swimming pool, and unplugs it (or plugs it in, I don't remember which way it goes) and then carries the lamp and begins to follow me (the woman) as I get out of the pool. He stands directly behind me, wanting contact. I become aware of him. (100 words)

I have (or some woman has) created a theatre or movie set. She puts on shows there, but this upsets a man and a woman in the next room/area. It's their stuff to do that and this upstart has taken over their space. They come after her. Then it's like the same story, but it's Warren Beatty that lives in a huge castle/mansion. He's very rich. He has a jealous sister. He buys out her upper stories part of the mansion to create a theatre. He's up in the big room when a jealous boyfriend type man comes up. Warren wants to hide, but the room is empty. A trap door opens on the ceiling and a bed comes down from the hidden sky roof room. It lands on him, unfolding like an accordion. It hides him. The man tries to drag him out and beat him up. Then as though the dream repeats the story, the bed thing comes down again and hides him, only there is a beautiful spirit woman that lives up there and Warren is in love with her and wants to join her. He resists. Then his other sister and her daughter, his niece, come to the castle to see him, I think at his request. She (the niece) is now the dream ego. I/she walks into the corridor of the castle and see a huge door roll open, like in a dungeon. I peek in to its dark depths. I make fun of the image of Warren being courted by that beautiful woman spirit. I "see" her coming toward him, beckoning to him. He feels unable to resist her force. Spooky, I think, "Maybe Death is there!" I then see a huge, dark black-robed figure of death come toward me. I feel fear and start backing up. He comes gliding right after me and grabs me by the arms. He starts forcing me back toward the other wall. Maybe there's another door there. I struggle and now he's behind me dragging me down the hall. I resist, saying to him, "But I'm not ready yet. I'm too young." He laughs. He makes a joke. I poke his bony leg at the knee with a fork. Like right, that's going to help. He feels no pain. This is DEATH! He has a death grip on me and I am afraid. There is no way out; he has me. (403 words)

A man, Richard Chamberlain, and I are deeply in love. Another woman is in love with him. He and she are sort of engaged. She is American Indian. He must stay with her because of the vows. It is painfully poignant when we are together, because we know we can't have each other. There is some ceremony where he is placed between two cloth partitions (sheets). He is kneeling, like in a confessional. She stands on the left side behind the sheet, and I stand on the right side, peeking out from the split in my sheet (like two curtains pulled together). He smiles at me, sadly. Then she begins to get hysterical, accusing him of being untrue and doing her wrong. As her accusations get more hysterical and untrue and harsh, the entire tribe begins to see it is wrong. They walk away from her. She is now sobbing and screaming that she had been to the doctor's this morning and got bad news. Finally she's on the floor sobbing. Everyone has left the building except me and Peter Jennings. I resolutely stand up from her fallen body and walk away, now leaving her entirely alone. I feel very sad for her and worried she will kill herself. I say to Peter after we are outdoors, "I don't know how long I can bear to stay away. I'll probably return and stay with her for a while." I see my lover walking toward me. He and I meet, and lay down together slowly on the cement stairs. He touches my cloth collar at my neck caressingly, a forbidden touch, but we must connect. I sigh and say, "I think she's dying," and then I say, "It feels so good to be near you." He says, "Yes, for me too." (300 words)

I am at some resort hotel or something, a conference. I am tired and want to lay down for a nap in my room before going to town to sightsee with my brothers. I can't find my room. I walk down a row of desks like in school, to a wall where I thought there was a door. There is no door. I go down another hall and see doors and open one and go in, but find myself in an enclosed corridor that leads to the fun house kiddie attraction. I say, "What the heck," and go for the ride, thinking when I get there I'll find the exit and go to my room. The rug is like a conveyer belt and then there's a steep set of stairs that is more like a ladder. We go down. My brother Jake is there. He introduces me to a young girl (maybe 19 years old) named Casey. "Humm," I think, "maybe his new girlfriend." We arrive at the place, but it's a big auditorium where a comedy writing contest is going on and being judged. One of my scripts is in the contest. A woman is tired and wants to go to her room because the conference starts again early tomorrow. Dwight is around, but he looks like Rock Hudson and I say, "We can go to town and sightsee later." He says he doesn't really want to go; the conference is too important to waste time on that. I still want to go, later. I convince the woman to wait for the results of the contest, by saying most earnestly that if we leave, we'd only have to make Dwight bring us back really early in the morning and that wastes more time. Now the judge comes over with his sheaf of papers. A man who runs the place is crazy for me and is bothering me by insisting we get together. I keep kindly but firmly repulsing him. He is a driven guy who won't accept no. He tries to hug me and pull me away and talks to get my attention. "What is it you want?" he asks. I say, "I want to get the results (the range of points from the different judges) so I can figure out what I did wrong and get better with my writing." The judge says, "You did pretty well, really." I'm sort of a runner up. I try to write down the scores, losing the page and searching for it again. I can't find them and the man says, "Here's the code on this page. You look for this symbol and it tells you what page." I try again. As I am looking, he walks across the gym floor, bossing his employees around arrogantly. I smile at him, because even though he is obnoxious, there is something endearing about his single-minded love for me. He comes back and tries to convince me to go to his room. I laugh and say, "No, but I will give you a kiss, like a ceremony to knight you, because I can see that somewhere under all that brashness is a real human being. You have to learn to let him out so we can enjoy him." He's all over me, taking advantage and I laugh, pushing him away and say, "Oh, beknighted one, arise and be a knight." (565 words)

I am at some information booth and a woman is selling her wares. It is some new age group that sounds very good and intriguing and yet I have some doubts. Maybe they are a cult that starts invading your privacy and thoughts. I look at the children's books, a special device and some other things. I keep asking questions. I decide to buy some of the items to look at them in detail later. Now They show me an apartment I could rent, in Dover. It is a small one bedroom, with two double beds like in a motel room. A man and I are interested, but again, still unsure and hesitant. I ask the fat landlady what the rent would be she says it depends, ____ on down to 500 dollars. This sounds high to me, and the place isn't all that good a shape. but now she shows us it has a living room, a dining room and several more bedrooms. It is looking more like a good deal. The bed in the back bedroom is a narrow cot like thing. I test it and it turns out to be a flimsy hammock cloth. I ask if it is a hammock. She says no, that's not the bed. The bed would be brought in later and we'd have to sign a paper saying they removed the critters. It was some kind of an insurance scam. I don't feel good about it. She then hands me a brochure on the cheap computer they offer for sale. $13.95 and it does recipes and appointments and so on. I saw some strange contrivance in the bedroom that looked like a bathroom scale taped to a woodstove chimney that was that device. I look out the back windows to check out the neighborhood. Odd looking people, fat like a cow (and looked at first like he had an udder) and so on. We're not sure this is going to be good, but we are still interesting in finding out more. (339 words)

A sort of taciturn, sad or grumpy man gives me a gift. I look in the box and see some sort of leather wine pouches, of different sizes. I say oh, that will be nice. I can put them on my wheelchair for water bags. He says nothing. I look more closely and see there are small miniature things in the bag. I see 30 tiny florescent light tubes, in their boxes. and many more things. I begin to realize that this isn't a wine bag but a miniature room with furnishings. I keep opening little things and other little things are in them. This thing keeps getting more ornate and big and full of stuff. I like it very much and hope I haven't offended the man by not understanding the nature of the gift right off. (138 words)

I am staying at a house, perhaps my mother's house. Ellie is there as well. There are many rooms but I sleep in a tiny one twin size bed, if fact, I don't even sleep in the bed, I am uncomfortably curled up in my wheelchair and sleeping. Ellie starts to move her things to a bigger nicer room and it occurs to me I could do that too. I mention to my mother that I'd like to hire a part time helper as I can't do things for myself and would like to be comfortable. and I want to move to a nicer bigger room and sleep comfortably on a bed.

I am in a house with a lot of rooms. I decide to get on my exercise machine and discover it is broken. I realize I'd been enrolled in a business college course load and haven't been going to classes. How odd it will be to have a Masters degree and yet flunk simple courses. It will look bad on my record. I don't want to take the classes. I move into the living room, which has my father's bed in it. There is a sort of V. House feeling to this place. I try to use the exercise machine there, but no luck. I go back and count the rooms, and as I look more closely, I see the rooms are quite small and square and ordinary, which is the opposite of what my dream rooms have been like in other dreams. Jake is in a bed in the back bedroom. (152 words)

A chubby, flabby boy is a Buddha emperor boy and the priest comes up to him. The boy shoves his fat belly down to make a pillow for the priest, who lays his head on the belly, a sort of ritual greeting of emperor and priest. Now they raise him to sitting and drape his fat, flaccid penis over the edge of his bed and he pees. I watch, fascinated. It's such an odd shape penis and the boy is so spoiled he doesn't even use his muscles to lift himself up. It is all done for him by the priests. (101 words)

Derek/Darryl and I are going to the movies together, but first we go to his house to get something. We are talking as I gather up a wallet and borrow one of his. His buddies (the homeless motley crew guys) come over to hang out while we're at the movies. I look in the bathroom mirror and see my face and sigh. I think to myself, "I'd make an OK-looking man." I feel sad because I know Derek doesn't feel attracted to me and never will. I say, "I'll shut the window" and then say, "Oh yeah, that's right. You never lock anything. I do at my place, but it's a different kind of neighborhood, tougher." He starts to disagree with me and I get annoyed and say, "But, you don't know. I was almost..." I pause, I was about to say raped. He realizes that's what I was going to say and tries to listen. Chelsea then joins us. I feel the need to pee. We three walk to the movie house. (173 words)

I am sort of Sally Fields as a comedian. I come out on the stage, in front of the huge, billowing curtain. I, the dream ego, is watching from the wings. I see Sally dressed in a blue sequined gown with see-through overdress and her act is taking off parts of the outfit and the outfit look keeps changing. Now I am her and I look far down at the small and distant audience. The billowing curtain nearly knocks me off stage. I keep hissing at the curtain woman to open the curtains a bit more. She finally does. I come up with a funny bit of lines where I wait until they get nervous at me not speaking and then I say, "This comedy thing is harder than I thought. Apparently you have to say witty things and then they love you...apparently not. And they have to be funny to other people too." The audience laughs, but they are also dancing and running around. They are so far away they look miniscule. (173 words)

Charla and I are together in a big double bed with lots of space between us. I pick up a ring of hers and put it on, hoping she doesn't wake up and demand it back. It is an odd ring, an engagement -like look and then a long row of gold squares and another round engagement-like ring at the end of that. I see the second part is a separate ring, plastic, that just got stuck on the end. I think it's fun to pretend I have an engagement ring. (91 words)

I am an extra actress. I'm just in the background being a person sitting at a cafe table. The main actors are at other tables doing the play and I am supposed to improv gestures and pretend I am talking to other people and so on for the entire play. I keep coming up with ideas on what to do and even make a few funny remarks that could have been good lines in the play. The director, a man, wants me to make what I'm doing even bigger because it is so good. He dresses as a woman and wanders across the stage pretending to be one of the cafe extras and signals me to act as if I am leaving to go to the restroom. I do so, going off stage and he says to me, "I like what you're doing; keep on and make it bigger." I nod and go back on stage. More extras are there imitating me. (162 words)

I hear about a road that suddenly caught on fire. Apparently some cars with steel belted radial tires worn down to the steel were on the road, and rust spots were on the road. It was oil soaked from years of use and it caught on fire. I ask where this is, thinking it is on a coast in some exotic locale. Oh, and it is snowing there a lot, but the snow won't put out the fire. It will burn for years. I hear it is in the state of Washington. I guess I'm hearing a radio reporter interview someone. He asks if the road is closed and now no one can travel there. The man replies, "Yes, but we have the old road people can use." The reporter says, "But that one is windy and slow, right?" I see huge clumps of land mass with gaps in-between like the road will be built to cross those coastal gaps. It will make for hard, slow traveling. (167 words)

I am meeting my director in a department store. I get into an elevator and it isn't working properly, missing the exact mark to stop, so he decides to fix the thing while we are on it, which makes me a bit nervous. Now we go to an area to rehearse and basically he hands me the pages for the scene and talks me through the summary of what happens. Then I need to go to the bathroom and find one and pee. Now it is almost time for my scene. I feel a bit insecure because I might lose the lines. I have a few seconds of almost a panic feeling and then calm down and go. I am playing a silly director and wear a green beret and a butch short haircut, with pretty-colored gray and black hair like Mirabelle. I ham it up, making funny faces and following my director, who is also acting a part around the set because I realize we've never worked the blocking. Now the audience gets very vocal and noisy until we have to stop. I look out at them and they are fighting amongst themselves. We wait for a while, watching. They are seated like in a church balcony, and a bunch in the back, mostly men are standing and pushing and shoving and yelling. Then I see way up at the top, three or four rows of the young girls in communion dresses all leaving. Now they calm down a bit and I say to my director, "I'm going to go get my script because we've really had no rehearsal or blocking," and he agrees. I rush backstage to find the pages and am looking through a pile on a bed, couch thing. Another more veteran actress is saying something and I say, "You must help me find my script first because I'm on now. It's in a white folder." She agrees and I find the pages, feeling a bit bad about not being prepared, but OK because It wasn't my fault and we'll get through this OK. I go back on stage, looking at my director to help me know where to restart the scene. (366 words)

A man is standing and holds a baby by its hands as it is trying to stand up. I watch and the baby is a kitten and it scampers around. I want to play with it. I see it go under a chair and see that a much smaller kitten is in there. It's about the size of a mouse. I am worried that the bigger kitten will hurt it or eat it, and I crawl under to distract the bigger kitten. I play with it and rub its cute, fat little tummy. It likes that and leaves the smaller kitten alone. (102 words)

I take two male roommates to help with expenses. They put a sign over the door saying something like The Boys of Love or something. They see two young women they are interested in moving their furniture out in the hall and run out to ask if they are leaving the building. The women say no, they are moving to an apartment upstairs because it is cheaper. The boys are relieved. Now we go back into my apartment, which we are remodeling. They have taken up the carpet and rolled it up and put it in the hall. I see the floor and wonder if I made a mistake because the floor is very ugly and I will have to re-carpet the place, which will be expensive. Now I am showing the place to Paulina and Clarice (Paulina's daughter). I point out there are five different areas that represent five different characters. I see lots of early American wood stuff and decide I don't like that style. I see a picture of a woman in black and white and remember showing the same picture to Clarice when it was in full color. It is a large wall portrait of a woman standing. I go back out of this end area. Paulina says, "Here at least it looks like you," meaning the furniture and accessories are mine. I smile and say yes. Now I see Millie talking to another young woman relative. She then looks at a wood carved statue of several people in a canoe and I am explaining how sad the one woman figure is. She can't seem to see it. I try several times to point it out to her. Naomi asks something. I say, "Oh, yes, books all over, but this section the books aren't mine. They belong to one of the characters. I can't even find a book on those shelves I care to read." (319 words)

Susie S and I are walking along a road talking. I am feeling a bit defensive and hurt as she is saying we have a problem because I begrudged her two hours of work that she felt I still owed her. I say, "No, wait. Begrudged? I don't begrudge you those two hours." I feel a bit dishonest because I do feel I gave her what was required. I try to speak honestly. I say, "It's the sarcasm. I don't deal well with sarcasm, and I thought I had done the work well and gave you all that was required, so I felt hurt." She says, "Then you'd be willing to meet me tomorrow morning to talk this all out?" I think to myself, "I hope not too early," then I say, "Yes, of course. I just don't do well with sarcasm and feeling attacked. I admire and respect you and your work and if you feel I shorted you in hours, I will give you the hours." She seems to understand and says she's sorry she was sarcastic; it is a bad habit of hers. We continue to work it on out. (193 words)

I come to a family reunion. I am in a hotel room and I get up. The two young girls are playing very noisily so I can't sleep. I am looking for my hair and tooth brush but I realize I haven't packed them. How annoying. Well, I'll borrow my mother's. I see a pile of books I did pack. There's a Georgette Heyer book and many others some from my youth. I want to curl up and read them all, but there is no time. I will never have time to just read them, all the ones I like. Oh well. Now I go into the bathroom where the two girls are playing, being noisy and using other people's stuff. I tell them to stop it and find something to brush my teeth with. Now I return to my room and see the maid is there making up my bed, putting new sheets on it. She's a slovenly dressed, plump lady who sort of lays down as he works. I notice she has waxed the floor and it is slippery and there are thick iodine red or that Benodine stuff they use at the hospital, red puddles on the floor. I slip and slide my way precariously out the door. Now I have to get down the very steep (like a ladder) stairs without slipping and falling. I hold on hard to the wood post on the banister and carefully walk down. Then I start going faster and start skipping steps, and finally at the end step on a couch and hop over some things and jump the last flight of stairs and land unhurt on the ground floor. I see someone, a woman, watching me and I see I left some slipper marks on a step or two and the back of the couch. I am kind of surprised I didn't hurt myself on that last jump. So now I get to the room where the reunion is happening. I see Patricia and her husband Morton, and music is playing and people are in Halloween costumes except me. I didn't choose to wear a costume. Now I am dancing with Patricia's husband and I don't know the steps because it is a country dance, but he wraps his legs strongly with mine and I follow his lead very well. At the end of the dance he is surprised when I say I've never danced this kind of dance before. He is impressed. I go to find the relatives I like. As I walk through the room, I see Grandma Mildred there and am surprised because she's been dead for years. She looks years younger and rejuvenated. She is still an older woman, but she has cleavage and somewhat pretty breasts, long pretty hair and is in a sexy white negligee gown thing. Millie comes over and says, "Hey, I only want to talk to the ones I find interesting or that I like," meaning her mom and me. My mother is nearby, watching. Grandma is chatting and Millie wants to talk real and important things. I wander off and a band is being set up to entertain us and I say to the organizing woman, "Let me do a few things while the band is setting up." She at first is reluctant because usually my stuff has been boring or repetitive. I tell her, "I won't do the old stuff, like Evangeline; I'll do a new comedy routine and a dance number I learned." She hesitates, but since I agreed to do it while the band is setting up, it's OK, so I go out into the center of the room. The benches (like church pews) are placed in a theatre in the round style, but some of the benches face away from me. I start talking a comedy routine and at first it's pretty deadly quiet in terms of laughs. As I continue and build, they start becoming more interested and laughing until I have their attention and they enjoy my routine, which is improv and just me talking. Now I am going to dance and I call for my partner. Now the point of view shifts and I am in the audience watching this beautiful flighty woman and her partner dance. I am sitting on the floor in the gentle arms of some man. Now the male dance partner comes over and comedically opens his cape to reveal boxer shorts over tights. He wiggles his hips and the shorts fall down around his ankles, only there's another pair there and he repeats this two more times. The man I'm with gets a bit worried as this is a family audience and the children are there. Then the male dancer grabs his crotch and makes an obscene gesture. I am uncomfortable, but hoping everyone sees it's for comedic effect. Now the woman dancer with wonderful, curly long hair begins to dance and she steps on the back of a bench and twirls and dances around the room. (840 words)

Leighanne, a man, and another woman and I have ordered some food from Taco Time. We get our order but it is all wrong. Who ordered the Enchilada, or the chicken nuggets and the burritos came with everything and so on. I ask the others if they are willing to accept the order. I see a few things I would be willing to eat and from lack of interest, we all decide to keep, or rather a decision is never actually made. We just didn't do anything about it. I am looking for the chicken nuggets, but the pretty woman ate them. She is wearing a beige, lacy, sexy dress and I wonder if the overdress is mine, but it's just her shawl. She is like Jessica Lange in "Blue Sky," very sexy. She is wondering where the costume department is. She goes off looking and I try to pack up the food stuff and my shoes and this and that. Then, John (a fellow teacher) is a black man and he is doing funny impersonations. He's doing one where he must walk backwards in front of a person (also a black man) who is walking toward him and as he does this, he is talking like he is threatening this person, like he has the power. This is very funny and he says it only is funny when he walks backwards at the same time he is trying to sound threatening. Then the black man asks him to do another impersonation. He does a famous important man, maybe Martin Luther King. He is very good and he is also still walking backwards as they go into the Theatre Department building. Now I go into a classroom and John is there, only now he looks like Robert Young, in "The Second Woman," about a man who might be paranoid and dangerous, but the woman loves him. A black man comes in and John and he are having an argument that is at an impasse. John teaches class on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 1:00 to 2:30 and the "Makeup Man" wants that room at that time. Neither is willing to budge. I take the role of fascinator or mediator. I write on a blackboard the headings "Makeup Man" in a purple/pink chalk, and on the right side of the board, I write "Instructor." We are going to list all the objections until we can come to some compromise. I notice the Instructor space is larger and more convenient to get to and say, "Oh, oh. I am not being fair. I'm already biased." I go to another board and try to make it equal. (443 words)

I am lying on a couch, burning a candle and watching it burn. It goes out and I try to relight it, but now there are two, no, three, no, four wicks. I light them and one or two go out and I relight them. Now they are all burning and as I hold the candle in my hands, it is now a square of wax and melting very quickly in a strong line down the middle. I realize it will melt through and it does, breaking into two pieces. I ineptly say, "Oh, Oh, Oh," as the hot wax splashes out over the coffee table and on the carpeted floor. Just then, as I am up and grabbing a towel to clean up the mess, I notice the front door is slowly opening. I go to the door, afraid and try to close it, but two teen boys, one very blonde and has mild CP, are in the room and I know they intend to rape or hurt me. I say, "No, no, no," in an inept way and open the door for them to go out. I try to insist, but they laugh and I manage to get them out and shut the door and lock it. I know they are going around to the back door. I go to the phone and dial the whole number for the police department and wonder why I didn't just dial 911. I give my name, Barb Sanders, and my address, 795 W. Street, #302, E City. I say, "These teens are breaking in and I'm afraid they will hurt me, and I need someone to come and check it out, just in case." The police don't seem too interested in helping me. (292 words)

Charla is deliberately refusing to obey me. She is running down the stone steps of a huge Catholic church. I am very, very angry at her and crying and upset. I cry out to her, "You must stop. Come here at once," and so on and she laughs at me and keeps on going. I know somehow that to keep chasing after her and pleading in anger isn't going to work and I should withdraw, but I am driven by my strong feelings to continue. It's as though I can't stop. Jake comes up the steps and I see he is going into a room that has religious statues and I hope he will at least nod his head toward them in respect, although he won't do the Catholic thing, seeing as he isn't Catholic.

I am on some deserted island place, and I see a brown, strong naked woman run past me. I follow her to a pool. It is a ritual bathing place. I and some other person with me go into the pool, not knowing what we are supposed to do or why we are supposed to do it. There is a recessed shallow spot off the deep larger pool and I/we are in it. I look out and see the pool is deep and empty. The water is very clear. But I sense danger around. I see a huge crocodile swim past me, its tail braided. I am not sure if it is merely an animal crocodile, or if it is an intelligent life form. It crawls out on land and signs in as Captain Morg. I stay in my shallow area afraid to go out into the larger pool. Now a car drives out onto the water, does a turn and drives back. These people aren't afraid. Then a person walks across the water to the hallway on the other side. I look into the hallway and see a group of people walking toward the pool and an exit sign glowing at the far end of the hallway. I feel stupid and cowardly hanging back in my little recessed area as these other people matter-of-factly go about their business. (229 words)

I am walking along and see a child movie star. She will play the lead in a children's movie. Now I go into a large room set up with backless benches and a few chairs for children to watch the movie. I sit on one of the chairs because the benches would give me a backache. But the chair keeps sliding backward. I pull it back to where it should be and it slides again. I can't seem to stop it. I wonder why I am wasting my time watching this movie which is either Wizard of Oz or Cinderella, when I could be watching one of my taped movies. The screen is far away and is a white bed sheet. I won't be able to see well. I think I'm there because I'm curious and drawn to the fact that there is an "important" person there, namely the famous child movie star, even though I am not particularly interested in her or her movie.

I seem to be the prison warden. The men are surly and dangerous. I have to stop something and I use fast karate blows. I am damn good at it and beat my foe. Another powerful inmate is watching me closely, looking for his opportunity. I then go to the infirmary for the doctor to bind up my wounds, but he is also my fiance and he rejects me, I think because he doesn't want me doing this dangerous job. I am hurt, but bravely go on. I return, exhausted and emotionally drained, to my office and find a young woman and a Hispanic man trying to make out on the floor by my door. I tell her to be in my office at 3 o'clock and I'll teach her about birth control and then I decide the man better be there too. This was yet another betrayal and I am angry and self-righteous, and yet I'm trying to be doing the right thing for these people too. I enter, but it isn't my office; it is a courtroom. I interrogate the prisoner who is on trial, the man I beat up, and the other powerful man is secretly sending him signals by scraping the legs of his chair against the floor when he should not answer. I realize this is a code even though it is subtle. I am on the alert. [BL] (233 words)

I am a member of a woman's club. The president of the club and another woman get into a scandal thing with one woman supposedly moving in on the other's husband. There are two teen boys as well that kind of do the same kind of thing, one taking something the other has. Now the president doesn't come to meetings. I guess she is ashamed. Time passes, and at a meeting I watch as the two women start talking it all through and now the whole thing is understood and accepted and behind them. The president resumes her duties. Now I am at a woman's house. I am admiring a special tree where she has grafted different fruits on it. There are grapes and cantaloupes and bananas on it. I am very impressed. How neat to grow your own fresh fruit, all on one convenient tree. I look at a series of glass tubes with liquid stuff bubbling around in them. I ask some questions. These tubes are the special acid/ph factor balance stuff for this special tree. Now I am eating a cantaloupe from the tree, only as much as I say, Ummm, how tasty," it really isn't. I keep scraping out these masses of black seeds, like watermelon seeds. It never seems to end. The bites are stringy and pulpy. I finally realize this isn't good fruit. Now I go inside to help the woman decide to leave her husband. She hasn't opened her mind to what misery she is really experiencing in the relationship. Now she sees it. (261 words)

I am at a Family Reunion, the Sanders side, I think, lots of cousins and small children and babies. Some of the small children are very active and noisy and as much as I love being around them; it is hard. Now I am sitting behind Aunt Abigail and somebody talking to someone, maybe my father. I watch as Francis P hides behind a door and watches as Delilah comes in to ask if Francis got a present. I laugh and whisper to my father, "Isn't that something, how he sent his wife in to ask for something?" Abigail turns around and I peer closely at her bright hazel eyes. They are intense and quite pretty, with many golden flecks of color. I laugh, a bit uncomfortably, feeling caught. I say, "You sure are pissed at me." She says, "You don't like them, do you." They are too rowdy for you. I feel embarrassed and try to fix things with a bit of a white lie. I say, "Well, that's true, we aren't the same kind of people, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy them the one day of the year we see each other. I thought it was kind of cute." This mollifies my Aunt and I am relieved, for she was as intense as a mother bear protecting her cubs. The reunion goes on and now I am watching my father's montage TV screen, a special machine to create a montage of past events. He had already edited the reunion footage and added a narrator's voice, his own voice, to it. I see myself in a pretty dress, low bodice and a small waist. I look good. I am wearing a pretty wide brim hat and posing with smiles. Then I am playing a silly role of a very fat or pregnant woman in the same dress. Then I am riding one of the small horses, not Ginger. I am riding the brown one and I see myself from the back end as the horse trots and then playfully gallops. I ride her through a sprinkler. It is fun and we stop to soak up the cool water. A pinto horse is named Ginger. The noisy child that is hard to be around likes the horses. (379 words)

I am seated on a couch and Leroy, my cousin, comes over and sits near me to kiss me goodbye. He and his wife are going home. I love him and I feel he loves me. We lightly hug, as his wife is standing there watching, almost in slow motion, I lean up and our lips are close together. We steal a soft, loving kiss in a way that the wife can't see. Now he goes home. I find some reason to go there. The wife is very suspicious of us and we are very careful, but we are indeed in love and take every stolen moment we can to brush up against each other or look into each other's eyes. This is a difficult life we are moving toward, a suspicious wife, we don't want to hurt her. They have been in a good relationship for years, but our feelings are too strong and we can't resist. Apparently I was in a play, because Leroy says to his friend, "Tell her you liked the play." He comes over and says, "Yes, Grandmother, I loved your play." He was very polite. He and I talk about how special and alive one feels on stage. Even if you are not alive and ordinary off stage, you can always go back on stage and recapture that special alive feeling. (227 words)

I think I had been traveling in Europe and have returned. I am now on a country road, looking for a small town I used to live in. I pass the town and end up in some other small town. I stop at a house and a woman says she will walk with me for a ways until I get my directions. I say, "I think I'm looking for L City or A City." We come over a rise and look down into the valley and see farmlands and a spire on a university brick building. I say, "We are in Mo City, the Western (state) State University." Some woman asks me the name of the main hall. I say, "I can't remember." I remember the one for L. and I remember the one for another university. It is a very pretty scene. (143 words)

Lucy and I and some others are about to take an important test, like for a masters degree or something. A woman is lecturing about something Lucy didn't understand. I realize I could answer it well, and this woman isn't. She is meandering and missing the point. I choose to keep quiet and let her do her thing. It's time to fill out forms to take the test. I have papers with me with addresses and so on in case I need them. I can't seem to fill out the form. All the places where it looks like I should fill things in seem to be only for people who are applying for grants or entering a contest. I am confused. I then find the right place and start to enter my name and university name. (136 words)

A small girl is in danger. I am trying to protect her. A male gangster has a gun and henchmen and is trying to poison or take the little girl. The girl is very afraid. I see a box delivered to her and in it is a bottle like Fiberall and she's afraid of it. She is lying in the box with plastic inserts like ears next to her head. She looks terrified. I take her out and hear the gangster coming and tell her to go into the bathroom and hide. She does. The gangster has a gun on me and I have a gun on him and we threaten each other. It's a standoff. I feel great hatred for him. He's mean and persistent, but somehow he's not really trying to be a bad guy. We keep up the threatening stuff at each other. (146 words)

I spent the day looking around and exploring a huge mall or market place, which feels like the Internet. A man and I become acquainted and we informally wander around together. That night I go home to my father's house, where I live. The man and I are discussing about maybe getting together again tomorrow and seeing something that we both are interested in, but there's an interruption. I go into my bathroom and notice the bathtub faucet is leaking. I turn it closed and give it one last turn for good measure, to help conserve water, but this starts a drip and then a stream of water from the shower, which is perpendicular to the bath tub. It can't be fixed by adjusting the knobs and now a lot of small jets of water are spraying out over the bathroom. I leave to go find my father in the living room to tell him to fix it or get a plumber. I walk at a fast trot for what seems like miles and finally reach the living room. I am amazed how big the house is. It's not very convenient. I remind myself to get everyone in the family's phone extension numbers. Next time I'll call. I find my father seated in a small coal bucket-like thing with two kids. He's reading them a story and I call to him, but he can't seem to hear me. I try several times and finally he looks up. I tell him about the problem, and we start walking back quickly to my bathroom. It is a long journey. I realize I'd left that poor man up in the air about tomorrow and wonder if he'll come back. I feel bad. We arrive to find the man in the bathroom and he's fixed the problem. He put in a few washers and some small plastic cups to shield the faucet in case it does it again. I thank him and he says, "It's nothing," but does manage to mention it cost him 20 dollars for the plastic things, but he needed some himself, so it's OK. I want to pay him back and I am unclear if this is my father's expense, as it's his house, or if it's mine, because I am an adult and I live here. I want to pay for it myself. I try to introduce the man to my mother but can't remember his name and apologize, making a small joke about no brain cells left after a long day at the mall. I remember his name is Martin.

I am a woman who is interviewing for a job. A man named Will is across the desk from me. He looks like Liam Neeson in Nell. I tell him I was fired and there was sexual harassment and so on. He asks me if he's the first person I've interviewed with. I say dryly, "No indeed. As you probably guessed, I have had lots of interviews but no one will take a chance on me. They think, like I think you are thinking now, that it will happen to them. I will accuse them of sexual harassment, like I'm the perpetrator, not the victim." He looks sympathetic. Then I see a scene happening in the next room down the hall. A beautiful woman is distraught. She is resisting going into a room and she calls out "Bear, Bear," which seems to be a name of a small child who disappeared or was hurt. She is sobbing. I see a mask that a child drew on the wall. I also see a written report that says "Domestic Violence." Now Will leaves the room and I wait for his answer. As I wait, a small odd-looking man, like a leprechaun in a business suit, walks conspicuously through the room calling my attention to him, nonverbally. I watch as he leaves the room by a side door and then I look out the window as he sneaks back around to the next door and sneaks back into the hall. "Humm," I think, "he needed me to be a witness to his leaving. There's something fishy going on here." Will returns and is kind to me. He shows me a glass figurine of a horse which belonged to the other woman. I hold it on my arm and look closely. At first it is a glass figurine of a shoe, an elf or ancient woman's shoe, then it is a horse on spindly glass triangle legs. The legs break off and I am trying to reattach them. I notice there are shoes on the ends of the horse's legs like the shoe the entire figurine was at the beginning. (356 words)

I go into a church and I find Derek lying on a leather chaise lounge kind of couch. He is staring contemplatively at two or three paintings set up on easels. They look like his dream pictures. I walk past, greeting him and put something away and then come back. I look at the first picture and see a horse. Then as I look at other details I am struck with how dynamic this picture is. As I shift field of vision, different depths become active, vital and to the forefront of my awareness. The middle ground becomes illuminated and I look at it, and then I am drawn into the background, which happens to be horses raining from the sky, and mountains. I turn to Derek and tell him what I saw and how amazing this sifting of perspective is. I like the picture very much. I sit next to him as we talk. He is silent and contemplative. He adjusts his position to make room for me near him. I reach for something across his chest as I am talking, which places me in a sort of hug position across his body. As I do this, he touches my hair tenderly and says very softly, "Will you....marry me?" I hear the "Will you" and guess that the words are marry me, although I do not actually hear them. I say, "I can't hear you. What did you say?" He touches my hair and I can't tell if it is just a casual caress or a real sign of affection. I want it to be, but I don't want to respond as if it is unless I know it is, so I won't scare him and embarrass me. I touch his hair in a caressing manner. The feelings are very confused and mostly I feel ambiguous and he is ambiguous. It is tender and I like it. Then he gets up and moves several of my file cabinets for me. I guess I'm moving my office to this area. He is helping me place things. I examine the placement and say, "Would you mind if these two cabinets (which were mine) are first in line with the others (from a previous office owner)?" "No problem." We move them. (379 words)

I am trying to teach a class about subtle communication stuff like nonverbal behavior. I am talking about small eye movements and so on when I see they have left, maybe a recess or they are restless or something. They come back in and I continue to try and teach. The man teacher who had been distant is now trying to help me. We end up burning a pile of garbage and cardboard. Somehow this is a together, helping thing. (80 words)

I am in a hospital getting blood, or giving it, with maybe a surgery coming up. I am in a hospital corridor looking for the elevator. A woman comes up and introduces herself. Apparently I know her. She asks me if I will go see Santa Claus. I say, "Oh, maybe." I look down over the railing at the Santa surrounded by kids. He smiles up at me in an inviting way. I then start to go around the corner to find the stairs. Howard comes up and asks to borrow my glasses. I give my second pair. I am now wearing a Santa suit, a round ball for a fat belly. The jacket is open. I am walking down the stairs and kids look at me. I close the jacket. I go around the corner and find the line for Santa. Howard comes back up after the Santa thing. I need some glasses and he offers his to me. I laugh, saying, "I'll try but I won't be able to see anything," since his prescription is worse than mine. I look at them before I put them on and am surprised to see they are one huge lens, not two. I put them on and can see just fine. I tell him I like his better, because mine are trifocals and hard to see out of. A man watches, friendly like. (232 words)

I am sitting on a couch cushion that sits beside the couch. The problem is, the couch is in a large body of water. It is getting soaked through and beginning to sink. I am aware there may be danger in the water, sharks, perhaps. I go to dry land. There is possible war there as well. Now I am going to go to an informal audition. I had shrugged it off at first, not particularity interested in home grown theatrics, but decide to participate, feeling like this is a cinch, I can do this in my sleep. I decide to change clothes. I go into another room where Deirdre, my cousin is. I ask to borrow some clothes. I choose some pink sweater and a skirt. I look at it and realize that it looks a bit tacky and ordinary when I had thought the outfit would look slinky and good. I'm a bit disappointed, but can't see anything better. I wander back slowly, getting distracted. I am a bit arrogant and uppity. Other people are all excited and enthusiastic about the play coming up. (186 words)

A Native American man is nearby. I am working hard, resenting the work and feeling overwhelmed. I am doing the dishes and trying to organize piles of papers. He says to me lovingly, "I'll do the dishes for you. It's all right." I feel guilty and relieved. He assures me it is no problem. He would love to help me. I uneasily let him. I now try to straighten the papers. He says he will do that too. I then start to dance around in a circle, slowly at first and then with more pep and fun. I like the dance. So does a small dog, maybe a Terrier, who leaps into my arms on one of my dramatic twirls. It looks so cute and the Native American watches lovingly, happy to see me happy. I do it again, with the dog, just to feel the endearing smile of the man. Now I see another man, actually a suit of clothes all folded up, only a thin, ill man is in it. I pick him up gently and hold him. I have great empathy for him and his pain. I smile tenderly and say, "I understand how hard it is and how beautiful it is when you can reach that moment when you can love the pain and yourself. It is a rare moment and hard to get to. But it is ecstatic when you get there." (237 words)

I apparently now live in a very large house, but only use a couple of the rooms. My cousin says to me, "Perhaps you will take in Deirdre. She could live with you." I feel the woman's need to better the situation of her child. I look into the bright green eyes of the child (perhaps middle school or early high school age). I say, smiling, "I'd love to have a child with green eyes and green hair." It is really blonde hair but she has a huge green hair ribbon on. Those eyes are an illuminous bright green, a very unusual color for eyes. She is happy. I tell her she has to fit into the routine and get up at this hour and do this and that and then we'll all get along well. I think it will be more work, with the baby I already have, but it will be OK. I wonder if she will go to W. High School. Now the scene shifts and I am talking to the principal, a tall, large man. I am investigating what seems to be a racial discrimination situation. I am a journalist in attitude. At first the principal is hostile and defensive. I guess he thinks I am accusing him. I keep interviewing people and the focus shifts bigger and bigger until the principal says, "Ah, I see. You are now looking at Universal Peace, not just a discrimination thing for one person." He relaxes and is helpful. (250 words)

Lucy and I are together. I realize I've been skipping classes again and will get yet another term's worth of failing grades and "Y"'s or incompletes. I feel like a failure. Lucy asks me if I've talked with Dr. Roy. I then start drinking out of a small baby bottle; I am sucking water. I kind of feel some satisfaction reverting to baby, but a woman disapproves very much, at me, a grown woman behaving like a baby. I feel a bit guilty. (83 words)

I am in a house. Charla is being naughty and noisy and I tell her she has to take a nap. I pick her up and put her on the bed and she wriggles around. I give her a small swat on the butt and say she has to stay there and I'll know if she sneaks out. I leave the room. Several women are there in the house and they are uppity, high class women who disapprove of Charla's behaviors, and they disapprove of me. They follow me around being snotty. Now I am in an acting class and they are in the same class. Everyone looks down at me and laughs openly at me. I take it in stride, not getting angry. I am a bit frustrated, but I laugh at them being so silly. They hate that. I tell them quite bluntly and firmly I don't like their attitudes and behaviors. I am matter of fact. They get very angry at me and are vengeful. The man I am to act with takes on their attitude and is sneering at me. I look up at his face, all deformed with a glass milky white eye. I say to him, "You are very ugly." He lunges at me, supposedly acting and I side step and move away. A woman comes near me and I jump, like I'm going to defend myself from her physically. I have a pair of scissors in my hand I hold like a weapon. I feel a bit embarrassed because she isn't attacking me. (260 words)

Now I am in a very ritzy house. The kittens, three of them, and a puppy, all want out and I go to open the door. They had been cooped up in the house too long and need to pee. But as soon as they get out the door on the porch, they want back in. I won't let them back in. Now more uppity rich women come to the door and tell me Mrs. Baxter wants to talk to me. Then they leave. I smile and agree to visit Mrs. Baxter, even though I know they all hate me and it cost them dearly to even speak to me. I now walk down the sidewalk and am in awe of all the very rich houses, very colorful. I gawk like a tourist. I can't find Mrs. Baxter and keep walking. I ask a woman does she know where Mrs. B. lives and the woman says yes she does. I then ask if she will tell me. She thinks, smiles and says no, she won't. I hear a group of women, who have been following me, laughing at me. I know this is a stupid joke they are pulling on me, but again I am not angry, but choosing to do what I want to do, which is see these beautiful homes. I come to the end of the land and see the beautiful vast sea. It's a resort area. I'm on a promontory point and I look down and see huge mansions and the ocean beyond. I look back to my left and see people sliding and playing in a frothy surf waterfall kind of thing. When I look down, I feel dizzy and vertigo. The woman are laughing very loudly and applauding my "stupidity." I walk back toward the house, still deliberately ignoring the women and seeing the sights. I see one house where a woman sits on a blue couch and chair set outside of her house. (330 words)

It is Victorian times. I am one of four sisters who are having trouble getting a marriage partner. I find myself walking up a mountain road to a resort that is for people to meet future mates. The driveways are unfinished and only partially paved. There is rough dirt and gravel. I wonder why I chose such a low class (middle class) place to go to. I feel a bit embarrassed and ashamed I have to do this. I see the name of the hotel on the porch. Something Bachelor Beau____. I look again trying to commit the name to memory. The word "sin" is there followed by a goose and a gander, wooden carved thing. I chuckle at the reference to the sexes. I enter the main living room. I see several older gray-haired gentlemen and my heart sinks. A blind man, more my age, says to me cynically, "Are you here to get a rich husband?" I say, "No I am not." A door opens and several other men come in, one couple obviously gay. They are dressed in modern clothes. I am in a full length satin Victorian dress. I think to myself, "I would like this to be Victorian and I don't want the gay couple there." I am taken upstairs by a plumb maid. I don't want to be here. Now one of my sisters is here. We are both trying to get a husband, only we kept this secret from each other and both choose to be at this hotel. She is annoyed to find me there. We are to go down to dinner. We barely speak. At the dinner table is a sinister, black-haired typical villain of romance novels. He wants me. I despise him. He sits next to Lydia at the opposite end of the table. I now leave the dinner and go out for a stroll. He follows me and presses his suit. I am repelled and faint. He picks me up and carries me back to the hotel. My hero, William Shattner, is coming up the drive and sees me being carried by the villain. He, William, says, "What's this?" I am taken into a room to be examined by a doctor, but my spirit stays in the waiting/living room seated on a couch with the villain seated on my right. William gets on bended knee and is trying to hold my hand. I try to resist, but tenderly keep my hand in his. He leans forward to kiss me. I permit it without returning the kiss and then my feelings overtake me and I kiss him. He now knows I love him. I say to him, "I (meaning the sleeping me in the other room) won't remember this." William says, "But I will," meaning he will continue to pursue me, knowing now there is a chance. The villain's lips twitch. He is very unhappy. (485 words)

I am back with Howard. He is sweet and caring and young. So am I (young). We have a baby and Howard is the main caretaker. He brings the baby to me. The baby has short, stubby legs with thick thighs. I look at his feet and say, "Oh he will grow up tall and strong. He has big feet." Then the baby gets up and walks around a bit. I am amazed. He is a newborn. Then he begins to talk. He tells me he has listened in to my thoughts. He is gentle, loving and an alien baby of some sort. I am very impressed and we bond. He is helping me. He gives me advice. I realize Howard and I haven't been sleeping together and having sex for years. I want to start that part of our relationship, willingly and with joy. Now there's a crowd of people and I am dressed very pretty. I've lost weight and another woman, a movie star, is trying to take the attention of the crowd. With the baby's telepathic support, I step into the center and charmingly take the admiration of the crowd, mostly the men. There is a bunch of FBI bodyguard type men there. Howard and the baby and I are going somewhere. (215 words)

He laughs at me and continues teasing me. I begin to dump out his pockets and so on, making a terrible mess. I am furious and self-righteous. He begins to like me and continues teasing me. I bolt from the place, now naked and stoned or drunk. I cross the freeway, not even looking to see if I'll get hit by the cars. I go down a bike path near the river. Dana jumps in the river and swims to try and follow me. I go into some restaurant and see a woman who is the manager. I remember I tried to be a manager once and didn't do a good job of it.

I and another woman are entering a big auditorium. We want to get good seats so we can see the events on the stage and meet in the back with our small group easily. It will be very crowded soon, we know, because we went through this before. I go to the left rear side and get a folding chair and then decide to go to the right rear side as that's where the small group will meet, but the athletic team has reserved most of the seats in the back and so I change my mind again and go to the left rear side to find all the places are almost taken and finally decide on the aisle. The ceremonies are starting and I lean way over to see. It is Rosalie, the Mayor of E City doing a discussion or speech and she's written "Rosalie" on the blackboard. It's just one word, her own name. I laugh and share this with a woman next to me. Then a male actor comes in and waits his moment. As he gets up to take a leather bag up the aisle shouting his lines, I realize the fingers of my left hand are caught in the straps and I am running up the aisle behind him, desperately trying to get my fingers out. I am wearing a bridal gown and veil. I finally get unstuck and go back and sit down. I tell the woman how embarrassed I am, how conspicuous I was. [BL] (252 words)

I am watching as a disembodied observer. I see an old lady on a motorcycle. She refuses to put hub caps on her back wheels. She wants the spokes exposed. She wears leather and is feisty and independent. However, she decides she wants a job. She offers to be a delivery person for messages. She is hired, but as she takes the leather message pouch and lays it on the back wheel, the employer insists she cover the spokes with a hub cap. It annoys her a bit, but she complies because she thinks the job will be fun and she can see the sense of it. After all, it would not be safe to let the bag get caught up in the spokes when she's driving. So she takes the pouch with the papers inside to her destination. When she gets there, there are forms to fill out and she has lots of difficulty getting this done. (158 words)

I and a man are together in a hot air balloon. We are traveling over a mountain. We are very close, but trouble starts. The balloon rope starts to fall or disintegrate. I try to hold on to it. We drift over to the west toward the ocean and barely make it, now landing safely on the beach. How very nice - we can camp here. We land. I see a restroom right in front of the spot we decide to rest at. How convenient, but will it block our view of the beautiful ocean? I look over around to the right sand we can see the ocean, calm but also coming right up to our edge of the camp. I think to myself, "Sure hope this is already high tide or that the calm conditions keep up or we'll not be safe here." We decide to stay. (148 words)

I am at a house, possibly my "mom's" house, and a combination party is happening. One group of people is my relatives and another group is my disabled friends. I go from one room to another, mingling and chatting. In the relative room, my mother, who is fairly young and pretty, and I tap dance together. Everybody likes that. We have fun. Then I go to the room with my disabled friends and we talk. Rochelle questions me critically. I made a statement and she'd say, "Did you actually use the masculine pronoun?" I just looked at her and said, "Yes, I did" (not politically correct, you know). Now a woman is going up on stage to sing a song with a big name rock band. I am her sister or friend and am asked to come on up and join in. So now there are four to six men from the rock group, "Heads and Roses," mostly drummers, and her and me. She sings and I add some harmony. The song is about "I love you Dad." Dad (not my real one) is out in the audience. Even though she is the star, I manage to get the last line in with excellent harmony and everyone is pleased. (209 words)

I am at some office building, maybe the newspaper. I meet Mark H and a man and we are talking. They show me a newspaper clipping from years ago about me and all the good works I am doing in the disabled community. Mark is gentle and sweet but somewhat distant. I tell him congratulations for getting the handicapped coordinator job at the community college and tell him I used to be that. I tell him he can call on me any time if he needs help or has questions. I do that to leave an opening so we could get together, if he wanted. Now I am at home. Mark and his sister and his cat come to visit. We all chat. Mark is shy, but seems to like me. I like him too. I hold his cat and the cat is loving and cuddles gently in my arms. It's as though I am holding him (Mark). This is a good sign. This means the cat, who is fussy, likes me a lot. This is important to Mark and his sister. Now they are leaving and I walk them out to the porch. Only now Mark is seated, semi laying down on a porch seat. I sit down near him and we talk. I look past him and see a huge river with lots of people playing and swimming. He asks me to describe the scene to him. I tell him it is a pleasant Sunday afternoon where people are all out to enjoy the wonderful weather and have fun. I tell him about four fat men who each stand ten feet apart and at a signal all fall in backwards into the river; the kids swimming and playing. A sled that looks like a snow sleigh goes by, with red painted trim. I describe that. A convertible car with no engine or hood in the front goes by, crawling over the couches near the bank. The driver is concerned that water is splashing into the empty place where the engine would be. He wants his spiffy car to stay spiffy. I say to him, "I'm sorry," thinking I helped splash some water. Then I say to Mark, "I'm always telling people I'm sorry." Mark and I are getting physically closer, our arms brushing each other. It is gentle and loving and shy. We are very attracted to each other. Mark tells me of his house, which is his but it's his mother's and his family is very important to him. Then I notice the river level is dropping. All of a sudden, the entire water contents of the river drain away and everyone falls to the bottom, including us. A man tells us that the water will be gone for one or two hours. I look up and see the man on a high balcony by a metal railing. The sun is warm and bright. I am looking up at him but aware I am shyly avoiding looking into Mark's eyes. I have Mark, a quad, folded up in my arms and I stand up and start walking, carrying him. The way is rough, stones, debris and boulders. It makes walking hard, but I am managing well. I get back up near the house and Mark says, "My brother left a taped message in your van for you." I laugh and say, "Then let's go hear it." We go back toward the van. (575 words)

Jake and I are traveling together. We stop at a motel. Jake is going to a conference. Some weird old lady who runs the motel chats with us. He looks at his brochure. Jake is very happy about the low cost and the great fun things he'll get to do at his conference. I seem to be along for the ride. The old lady shows us to our room and as she is still there. Several other people sort of wander through. A man on a bicycle cart that has video taped movies on it backs into the room. I go over and look for a good movie to watch. It would be fun to rent one, but they all seem to be boring or old titles and I can't find any I would be willing to watch. I say to Jake maybe he'd want to watch one of the old sci-fi ones. Jake says no. I notice he has blank write-in books there and say, "Oh, I have plenty." He leaves. Several other people come in through another door like they'd just come downstairs. Now the lady says something about the river in the back. I want to see the view. I go to the window and look out. I think I see the river and then I see it is just the highway. I look across the highway and finally see a pretty waterfall further down on the right. Then I realize the river is right in front of me, across the highway. I feel a bit foolish at not seeing it right away. Now the old lady wants to show me something and we see an odd elevator that has build in cubby holes where books and so on are kept like in display in a store. It goes up, so that a series of these displays are run past me. I see some ink pens and she says I can choose one. I try a couple of them and find one that writes in thick black strokes. I like that one a lot. I choose a pretty blue one and then she offers that I can have one of each color. I take the purple one also. (371 words)

There are wild mustang horses and I and some man are catching them and riding them. They have cartoon-looking eyes and each one has a sign held up or somehow on their faces below their eyes. The signs are pieces of large white paper with words on them. Now we are doing a documentary on the Wild West or cattle drives or something. We interview cowboys and then three Indians come by and I approach them to ask for an interview. I say, "I know we whites took your land and you have no trust of me, but I'd like to hear what you have to say." One takes an interest in me (I am a young, pretty woman with long black hair), He agrees to talk. Now the other man I'm with is the owner of a cattle herd and ranch and is doing a cattle drive. I decide at the last moment to tag along to help. I grab a horse, a blanket with a space blanket inside and some beef jerky kinds of food and gallop after them. This infuriates the man who chooses to ignore me or help me. If I freeze or starve, then fine. I follow along doggedly. At the ranch house, his mother says to me, "Make him talk to you. Then maybe he'll stop being so cruel and stupid." I laugh and say, "If I could, I would." He is adamant. Some other woman wants to help me and finds four umbrellas and ties them to my saddle bags. I say, "How will these help me? I'll take them if you can convince me they will be helpful." The woman tries to think of a way they can be helpful and says they would make paper sounds when opened and this may scare the cattle into moving, or scare away predators. I am not convinced. I ride out of the house to catch up with the man on the cattle drive. (329 words)

I am seated on the right end of a couch. I feel tired. I notice a cobweb right in front of me with two spiders on it, which gives me the creeps. I inch my way over to the left side and start to get up. I say something and a man seated at a table just to the left is furious and angry with me. He tirades on about how filthy and lazy I am. A woman sits to his left at the table, and I look first at the man and then at the woman in shock at this tremendous outburst. I turn to my "father" also at the table and I say, "Does he mean I don't bathe often enough and I stink, or does he mean I don't change my clothes often enough?" My "father," who is a stocky short man with thick dark hair and tired bags under his eyes, gets up and walks to me and kneels in front of me. (He looks like an older, tired Deepak Chopra.) He says, "I love being around you best when you..." and he gestures with his hand like he is wiping away tears. I'm not crying, but I do feel put upon and sad. Emotional, at any rate. Then he puts his head on my knees, rather than in my lap, and I have to reach a long ways to smoothe and caress his hair, which I do. I say, "I just don't understand." He says, "Ira Nah-nah," and looks at me knowingly, like I should get it. (262 words)

I am in a church community room and a group of church members are there. I have led them to believe that I am dying and they are having a ceremony for me. It is their tradition to gather in a semi-circle around the injured or dying person. Each member offers a gift and connects with the one who is dying in very touching, loving ways. The woman explaining uses the following example: "If a dying person wants to be treated like a queen, then someone might bring them a robe and drape it over them and bow and treat them like a queen." So, first the group stands in the front of the room and sings "Oh, Come all Ye Faithful." I stand in front of them, singing with them. I am deeply moved and near tears as I sing with them. The song is beautiful and I haven't sung for a long time, what with my throat difficulties. I am feeling very guilty for accepting all this outpouring of love on false pretenses, since I am not dying. Ellie is there sitting to my left. She looks at me, knowing I am cheating.

I am up all night with some people. I am tired. Ellie calls me up. She's had some premonition about me dying. Possibly Aunt Millie is around and we talk about it. Then a man friend named Richard comes over. He is heartbroken. He's in love with a woman who won't have him. I am supportive. Richard goes to see his Doctor and I go with him. It is 3:00 am and as Richard talks to the good-looking doctor (like Deepak Chopra in looks), people come to the door, one at a time and hand him handwritten notes. He pauses, reads them, smiles appreciatively at them and continues with Richard. One of those people is a young, frail teenage runaway girl. She has a crush on him. He is gentle with her. The doctor now asks me out for a dinner date. I smile and say yes. I like him and he likes me. The next night I come to his office. I am dressed in a sexy black dress. I am young and good-looking with a trim, firm figure, and I am wearing a coat, like a trench coat, over it. I want to dazzle him later with the surprise of how nice I look. He says, "The car is over here." I look and see a tiny black sports car. It is very spiffy, but as we get to it, it is filled with rusty brown water. The top is down and perhaps it rained. I don't really care one way or the other. He is watching for my reaction. Then he says he has another car and opens a garage-like door. It is up a few feet (maybe 4 or 5 feet) from the ground level and covered with a car protection tarp. He unties the tarp and removes it and the car goes backwards like down a ramp and stops next to me. It is a plain brown station wagon. I cheerfully open the passenger side door and see three plants with red flowers on the floor on the passenger side and some cardboard boxes. While I am chatting with the doctor, I move the cardboard boxes to the back seat, asking his permission first, to clear a space for me to sit. He seems pleased that I take all this in pleasant nonchalance. Now he's driving and I am seated to his right and slowly we inch closer together. I'm still in my coat. Now we are close. I say, "I used to live in cities but I don't like cities. I love small towns." He agrees. He loves small towns also. He says, "There's hardly any more places left on earth that don't have a road coming to them." I turn my face toward him and his face is so close, I kiss his cheek tenderly. He smiles lovingly. We arrive somewhere and discover that my friend Richard has been arrested by some military man. Richard had fallen madly in love with another woman who is no good for him. I want to rescue Richard, so I approach the military officer and take my coat off slowly. The doctor is behind me so as I slowly drop my coat, the military man sees the front and the doctor sees the back. They are both mesmerized by my beauty. I have sufficiently distracted the military man and Richard runs for the small row boat. The doctor and I follow and the three of us shove out into this huge lake. I notice the tip of a brown creature's nose peeking out of the waves and feel a second of concern that it is a monster. We continue on. It is a bit difficult as the small boat bobbles in the waves.

I am afraid of this young boy, young teen, maybe 12. He is going to hurt people, me included. I run from him, trying to block his route behind me. I am now in a house, with some other people -- a woman, a girl child and a nice man. I call the police. The boy is systematically eliminating each person. I dial 911 and calmly, but scared, tell them my name and address and this boy is killing everyone and he's after me. They must come at once. He's eliminated the woman, then the girl, and now he's got the man. I am still on the phone saying, "If you don't come now, it will be too late." He turns off the TV and is approaching me. I bolt for the door, even though I know my best chance is to stay in the house until the police get there, but now it seems my only chance is to get away from him. I run. I am now at a lake or river with murky water. I am in the water and there is a fence to my left, dividing the water. I grab it with my hand. It is an electric fence and sharp jags of electricity play on it and jolt me. Then I (the dreamer) decide that no one would put an electrified fence over water. It would be too dangerous. I see the raft the boy made. It is a single log, tied at both ends with rope and the two other ends of the ropes are tied together at a docking like of thing. This makes a triangular shape of the log and the ropes. He yells at me angrily, "No girl can touch my boat." He comes for me. He dives into the murky water and I use the log as a pole to keep him from me, and then as he bites my toe, attempting to bite it off, I use the pole to beat at him, trying to kill him before he gets me. I am afraid. He's got me and is gnawing through my toe. The pain is excruciating. I am screaming, "Help, Help!" to get the police to know this is where I am. Then I scream V, so they know it's me, the one who made the emergency 911 call. I wake up. (395 words)

Sharon L is teaching me to play a saxophone. At first I am terrible, with squeaks and noises, but with constant practice, I become very good. I am a man and on a stage. The audience is sparse and not too interested, but as I practice, the audience gets bigger and more interested. I decide to do a comedy act with the sax. The stage is very high. I see a paper with an article about 5th and 6th grade students and how as an audience they are disdainful and rude. They wander around and ignore and make noises talking among themselves. By now I am quite good and the audience is thick and attentive but very far away, and the stage is so very high. Now I have an orchestra of sorts with maybe five violins. I decide to expand and play the blues fiddle as well. I see Curtis Salgodo in the crowd and ask him to join me onstage playing the cello. We improvise. The music is very good. I'm thinking of learning the blues harp as well. Now the audience is also on the stage in raised seating behind me. I have only a narrow strip of stage to work on. I nearly fall off the front of the stage and get a dizzy sense of vertigo whenever I get close to the edge of the stage. I'm playing well and the audience is attentive, but distant. (241 words)

I am a woman who is being terrorized by a man who takes a medicine and is invisible. He grabs the steering wheel of the car I'm driving and tries to crash us and so on. I flee. Now I am a man and the same invisible man is after me. It is a life and death situation. I suspect my psychiatrist. I go into his office to see if I can find evidence. He comes in and I hide in his closet. a roomy coat closet. He comes in and I hide behind coats. He says to me, "I can smell you. I know you're here." He tries to feel me but barely misses me. He leaves. Now I've driven up to my own cabin or house. I sing opera and a rock group wants me to sing with their band, blending the two forms of music. The invisible man comes. There are lots of people in the room and I fire my pistol into the invisible man many times. Everyone thinks I've gone crazy and I ask them to leave. The supposedly dead, invisible man lays under my pool table. I feel for a pulse; he is still alive and I shoot many more bullets into him. Finally he is dead. Then a second invisible man is after me. I fight him too. It is terrorizing a nightmare. (230 words)

I am F. Hayward and John Wayne and I are very attracted to each other. We want to be touching and physically close all the time. Meanwhile I have a difficult boss. I am about to be fired. I work hard and I feel bad. "This is the second job where I got fired unjustly," I say to the snooty secretary. I want to explain my side to the boss. Now somehow I've created or am creating a movie. The boss is now the director or producer. He comes in and I tell him in a firm tone that he will ruin everything if he continues to use that authoritarian voice and lectures at the crew all the time. He must learn to listen, listen, listen well. John Wayne is standing by me ready to defend me or protect me. Now I look out the window and I see men swimming toward the very ritzy mansion I live in. I see a sailing boat, only it seems to be metal, like "Old Ironsides" with red running lights. I am the isolated hostess throwing a party for the people who have rejected me. I hope they will come. But I'm not sure they understood my side of the story. I wait, hopefully. Now these men are coming to the party to help back me up. I am pleased. The night is dark and the waters are dark. John Wayne had gone out and convinced them of my innocence. Now I see two women in evening dress approaching my front steps. They are hesitant, unsure if they should trust me. I encourage them to come in. Now the people come and we have a wonderful, happy party with dancing and music. I am wearing a beautiful flowing evening dress, of a 1940's or 50's vintage. John Wayne and I dance in anticipation of being alone to make wonderful passionate love. I am exonerated. (321 words)

I am traveling. I have borrowed Aunt Rosalie's car, a Thunderbird, 1979. It is a big Cadillac-like car, very powerful. I have some trouble managing the steering because it is so very sensitive and responsive to the slightest touch. I keep moving suddenly toward the other lane. The trunk has a special device to load heavy luggage and I use it for my power wheelchair. I think happily that I could get me one of these and then have the fun of a sweet fast car and be able to take my wheelchair. I stop now and am in a room with a piano, a black, shiny grand piano. I am auditioning for a very important director. I sing a blues or jazz like Ella Fitzgerald or some excellent singer. A star, an excellent singer, is also singing. We do a duet for part of the song. I sing well and with power. Then the song is over and I go over where some friends, or maybe strangers, are. One of them asks me what happened in one section of the song where I seemed to have no energy, or I was depressed. They were very serious and asked me if it was because the other woman and I were talking and the other woman confided in me that she can't have children. Did that mess up our timing because we got so depressed? I say, "No not at all. Sure we talked and it was sad. But what messed up my timing was the fact that I was so scared and in awe of the caliber of talent at this convention or contest." Really fine musicians are here and I was afraid they'd laugh at me or wonder how I even got into the contest, I was so inferior. The other chuckled that I can't even see my own talent, because it is obvious to them that I am comparable to the others. (324 words)

I have a questionnaire and I need three women and three men to answer it for me. I am on a bus and the door is open. A swarming crowd of revelers are all around. I watch as a man with a blue face lies on the sidewalk and tells the woman he's with that he loves her. I chuckle because it is obvious they are strangers and the man is horny. I try to ask several men to fill out the questionnaire. They are too rushed and busy. One hesitates and I kindly assure him he can go on, I can find someone else. Now the bus accidentally got caught in the Rose Parade. The marchers are a bit annoyed at us and we try to drive out of the way and park in a parking lot. We see a man who is very angry at a policeman for reprimanding him and he is angrily smashing the policeman's car to bits. Now I am in a huge house, perhaps a mansion. I am worried about Charla. A woman has lured her away and has taken her into one of the rooms and is molesting her. I see an image of Charla with her vagina exposed. I race from room to room opening doors and looking. I hear Charla calling off in the distance. Maybe she's on the third floor. I keep looking, worried. [BL] (234 words)

I am busy doing things and then Archie comes up to me. I think we are outdoors walking down a sidewalk. He hugs me enthusiastically and twirls me around so strongly my feet leave the ground and I am flying perpendicular to the ground. He reminds me that the dance performances are tonight (Tuesday) and hopes to see me there. I had forgotten and there was something else I planned to do that night. So I readjust and fit it into my plans. I go to the building and wander around the halls until I find the right room. I notice I am now wearing my old bikini style swimsuit. My legs and stomach are thin and nice-looking but my breasts are quite huge and the top of the swimsuit is partly undone and the breasts keep sort of falling out under the halter top. I keep trying to fix it so I'm not so exposed. I go in and people are preparing their individual spaces and props for their performance. I look around to find the right spot to put mine. I choose one place and then decide it's too much in the way of traffic and move it to another area. I lay out a couple of bunches of bananas in an artful way and hope no one comes along and takes a banana to eat; it will ruin the composition I made. Now I leave to go back and do what I had already planned, intending to return in time to do the performance. Now I can't find the van. I can't remember where I parked it. I am outside in the parking lot. I see what might be my van, but it turns out to be a station wagon with some hippie man on the top with all his wares spread out. I am relieved it isn't my van. I thought he was on my van. I see another vehicle, but it turns out not to be my van. I now am worried and annoyed with myself for not paying more attention to where I parked it. I go down a city street. No van. (359 words)

I am moving to an old house with odd rooms that spread out all over. Dwight/Howard is going to help me. Lucy and two babies are there. I am holding one and she is holding the other. We are trying to get them to nap as I walk around trying to think and organize how to manage this huge task. Finally, I get the baby to sleep. I open a door and it is a small bathroom. Really, only a bathtub is in it. I look at the kitchen, which has two or three wooden oak tables (dining room type) hanging way up on the wall for counter space. That will be awkward. Dwight/Howard comes in and I am frustrated trying to get his attention. He finally listens to my ideas but sighs and says, "It won't work. We made a mistake buying this rambling house and a mistake moving to M City. We belong back in the valley, so let's not take such care where things go and only unpack the essentials until we can move again." He then suggests we be friends again. I say, "No way." Now I kind of give up and sit on the couch with an older woman. I make a snide remark about how she can't work either because she's so old, and I can't work, cause I'm so old too. It's a sort of frustrated joke. Nothing seems to be going right. No one is helping. [BL] (244 words)

But a terrible storm is brewing. All the neighbors are leaving the neighborhood because the big beautiful trees are going to fall down and it is dangerous. We decide to stay and weather it out in our strong house. We go in and now others are with us. We go up to the top floor. One woman goes out on a balcony and nearly falls over the edge. I warn everybody to be careful because the marble and the stones are slippery. Meanwhile I am aware that there are spirits and ghosts there.

I come in late and fuss with my stuff and don't pay much attention to the teacher. Then Paul comes over. He is angry at me. He says I don't want to work with you any more. You're not really interested in the classes, you only want the attention. I am offended and uppity. I say, "I don't care if he quits, I hardly use him anyway. I do things myself." He walks away, but hangs around watching me in disapproval. Meanwhile I ask the Chicano man to do something and I realize I haven't bothered to pay him for weeks. I try to figure out how much I owe him. I hadn't really used his services for a long time but I did keep him on the payroll. So I write a check for $45, after deliberating if I should given him the third week, since I couldn't remember how long it was since I paid him. I decide to do the right thing and guess on the generous side. He is happy and Paul is impressed that I still have some humane values left.

I am at Ginny's house, only I've never seen this house. It's big and nice, but configured all wrong for her real house. Ginny is throwing some special dinner party because I'd had some kind of experience with some people and she wanted to celebrate it. It's her way of being involved, only everything went wrong. She set up computer monitors at each table and each table had a "field" sign which indicated which people would sit at that table. I sit at one table which is more like a TV tray and start to eat, but she says I'm at the wrong table. I'm kind of glad because I don't like the people at that table. I look around for some people I would like to be around. She hands me a postcard from a mutual friend and I read it, sitting on the couch next to her. All the other guests are milling around, unsure of when things start and what to do. Ginny is confused and keeps saying it's ready and then it doesn't happen. The people at the party are odd. There's a young boy who annoyed me and his father who defends him; a young princess-like woman who is totally selfish and her mother that defends her; a deaf woman and Jackie McC and her husband. I am now in a small adjoining room with the mother and daughter. The daughter is very upset because her lovely evening gown has a big hole in it. I had watched the deaf woman using water to wash that spot and it shrunk up the material. The mother is irate. I tell them to their faces I don't like them and their attitudes. They are very upset with me. Then I see Jackie falling and hurting her head and laying down on a couch and her husband all concerned. I say to the mother, "That Jackie, always an actress." I then barge in to do a funny bit. I pretend to be a helpful, concerned person and end up making her very miserable. I stand over her and insist she drink this milk concoction which I force down her throat. She does, but she spills it back up. I see it coming and do a "funny" routine about, "Are you going to.. no, you wouldn't. You wouldn't dare...Oh, you did." I feel a bit uncertain, because I begin to realize she really is hurt and wasn't acting and I've just made it worse. Just like Ginny made a bad situation worse with her intense attempt to be included. Ernie is there and I look out a back window and see the garage floor down maybe a full story. I say, "Wow, that's a long drop" and feel vertigo. I back away from the edge. (466 words)

I am watching as a bus comes around the corner of the house I'm in. A friend and neighbor, a man is driving the bus for kicks and the dark-haired woman driver is standing near the door laughing. It's all a good time joke. I laugh. Now I walk down the sidewalk to the woman's house. I buy a lace beige dress for $17. I am now eating oatmeal and drop a hot blob of it on my lap. It melts a big hole in the lace pattern. I am very surprised. I say to the woman, who is now playfully in the lap of the man, who I like, "I guess I'll have to ask for my money back." I don't want us to quarrel about this since my man friend seems to like her so much. I also feel a bit sad or jealous it is her and not me. She says quietly, "No, I don't give refunds." I am a bit annoyed, but still want us to be on friendly terms. I say, "Are you saying this happens to all the dresses like this? Because if it only happened to mine, then I have a defective dress and should be refunded. If it is all the dresses, then you sell defective merchandise and I should be refunded. Maybe I'll go find a lawyer and talk to him about my rights." She agrees to refund me. (238 words)

Some airplane wreck happened and one man is injured and another big plump man and I are in a room with the injured man. Richard, the big man, is the investigator and I am helping. The airline representative keeps coming in to Richard and saying, "The airline says they will give you _____" and Richard laughs and says, "Not good enough." While we wait for her to return, Richard and I playfully tease each other and talk. I tell him how my hair is all ruined now because I accidentally cut the bangs funny. Now I can't sing the blues right. He creates a poster that basically says that I am psychologically injured over my appearance being ruined. I think that's a bit much, but I seriously tell him how people think this is just a small thing, but it is really affecting my life in a big way. Richard is empathetic. We are annoyed that the airlines has put us in the very back room, behind the gymnasium, and there's even open doorways that lead out to other rooms where they are rented out for weddings. I see some bridesmaids lined up in the hall. So Richard and I go out for a walk and get outside. We lie down on the sidewalk near the grass. We're sort of in a wagon. I am holding a newborn baby. She is really cute and I enjoy her. But Richard is starting to want to get close and amorous. He puts her down by my feet in a small corner. I look to make sure she can still breathe there. She is fine. Then a man comes over, obviously an old friend of Richard's. He hugs Richard and kisses him and Richard laughs and says, "Hey, don't. She'll get the wrong idea." The man is pretending to be amorphous to tease Richard. I look at his hair. It's a bit messy, graying and balding, but he sure could sing the blues. I am impressed and he walks away singing the blues. Now I have the sweet baby girl in my arms and I am driving my wheelchair around the lawn, avoiding running over people laying on the grass and enjoying the ride with the baby. (374 words)

I am in a small town with Patricia and Charla. There is going to be a parade and a turkey roundup. We are walking down the street trying to find the best place to see the turkey roundup. We pass many people lined up on the streets to watch the parade. Finally we realize we've gone too far. I do see a place behind us that has music and big klieg lights. I figure that must be the place. We walk back to that place and see several circles of people dancing in bright and colorful costumes, but no turkeys. Now we go up some stairs into a building and find children in a circle to do the kid turkey roundup. We see the kids trying to catch baby turkeys. Charla goes into the circle. I see a turkey chick (which looks pretty much like an eagle or owl) on the back shoulder of a boy. Now Charla has her turkey and we decide to head back home, only now we are flying in a plastic laundry basket. We are looking at this new city called Yamhill which is all manmade. Patricia is saying that it is a shame that underneath all this beauty and modern convenience are debris and decay. Hidden beneath the pretty buildings and the manmade lakes are piles of rubbish. I nearly fall out of the basket several times as we fly over the city. (239 words)

I am at some religious healing revival meeting. Bonnie and Mateo are with me and some other woman. Behind me is an older woman and her husband. She is trying to talk to me and then starts repeating her words, like she's caught in a do-loop where she starts a sentence and can't finish it so she goes back and tries again. The husband cautions us not to interrupt her because that makes it worse. I have seated myself so I am near the aisle so I can wheelchair out if I need to. But as more people arrive, that aisle is filled up. I am given a huge syringe with a long needle. I watch another woman as she stabs herself with it and injects the healing fluid (which looks like water). I try it and make a stab at my leg. It goes through the muscle and out the other side (through the skin, really). The fluid leaks out I try and save it. (166 words)

I am piloting a plane, a fighter jet. I am flying low over the most beautiful terrain -- blue waters, deep canyons, mountains. I struggle to keep the nose up so I don't hit rough rocks and mountain jags. The terrain becomes rough and barren. I decide I prefer the more beautiful stuff and it shifts. Now I notice I am nearly out of gas. Apparently I was so enthralled with the flying and the beauty I neglected to notice the status of my fuel. I am embarrassed and concerned. I radio in a help call. An airport nearby answers. Then I run out of gas and have to try and hang glide in without power. It is a difficult struggle, but I manage it well. I land relatively safe, with the nose of the plane up against the back wall. There are some dents, but it is all in all intact. I am proud of my flying and others come over, also impressed.

I am going down a street and see Archie, who is very sad. He is growing older and has a disability, a limp or something. He can't do his dance as he has before. I point out I know what that's like. I try and be sympathetic with him. I am interrupted by a woman who works for Lori and Dan T. She asks me to come to the office. I tell Archie to wait and I go into an office room. Lori is there, rather upset with me, and hands me a paper. I feel trapped and don't want to deal with this face to face, but now that I am here, let's get it over with. The paper is a bill for a phone call made by a Mr. Nelson for $48. She wants me to pay it. I hesitate and then get clear. "No," I say, "I will not pay this bill. It is not my bill. And furthermore I am very unhappy that you billed me for the carpet. I will not pay for that. In fact, I am expecting you to reimburse me my prorated rent and my security deposit." She becomes very upset and dramatically says to her woman assistant she cannot listen to any more of this. Her face is contorted in over-dramatic nerves. I am aware of Archie waiting for me across the street. I feel compelled to try and get to him, before he gets upset and leaves. I am caught in the middle again. [BL] (254 words)
Barb Sanders:#2994 (08/27/96)

I am with some people. The men are selfish and rude. They get ahead of me and create a wooden sidewalk to where they want to go and it blocks my access. I ask them, "What about me?" They pay no attention. Now they are pushy and hurtful. I go into a house and find a man on a bed with blood all over him. He is very badly injured. I ask him if he needs me to call 911. He can't speak because of the pain, but nods his head yes. I try to find a phone. Finally, I have had enough. Those harassing men are after me. I had been trying to be accommodating, but now I just want them away from me. I'm tired of them hurting me. I yell at them, "Get into the boat! Get into the boat!" I shove them off and then see they have taken my purse. I demand they return it, saying, "I suppose you've taken all my money and credit cards." They arrogantly toss the purse at me. I am angry.

I and some other women are in a room. I see water pouring into the room. I get very concerned. The room will fill up soon and we will drown. We look for an escape route. I see a window. We end up in another room, only the water is following us. I look out another window and see a huge drop off. It's a well or tower area, but I look way up and see daylight. There's an open area up there. It's our only chance -- to go with the flow of water out the window and dog paddle in it until it rises up high enough to reach that light. It's like walking into death and riding it up to life. We do so and successfully make it, only to find that area of the castle is filled with men who intend to rape us. What irony! [BL] (150 words)
Barb Sanders:#2996 (08/30/96)

Nate returns. He is drunk. I am glad to see him. We begin to make love. Nate is angry and verbally abusive. I try to ignore that and stay with the sexual feelings. It's taking a long time to get to orgasm. An old woman walks in and chides Nate for his slowness. Nate stops. I am sexually frustrated. The old woman and I go to the "Hollywood" elevator to go upstairs. It is a raised seat, like a throne with a canopy over it. She and I sit on either side of the chair rather than decide who gets to sit on the throne. Somehow the sexual feelings are still there and maybe the old woman and I are going to finish it when we get upstairs. (128 words)
Barb Sanders:#2997 (08/30/96)

I am working at someplace where I work with the troubled cases. We have been given orders to move to another location. I feel tired. I am now looking for the new place. I see that it's a huge dorm or fraternity type house. I go past the eating booths. I find a sort of kitchen and then see a sign that says, "student rooms." I go in there and find long tables. I see Darryl sitting at the end of the one right by the door. I am very surprised and pleased to see him. I say, "Hi." He is happy to see me. I squat down and look up at him while he lays on his belly on the table and talks. He tells me some stuff about how he is working here now too. His face is very pimply. It is not so attractive. He looks as young as in high school, a teen. I answer his question and say, "I work with the troubled cases." He is a cook or cook's helper. It is time for him to go get the next rolling cart of food. He goes into an elevator and goes down. I wait. He comes back up. I peak in and see bologna slices on the cart. He doesn't want me to touch them. (221 words)
Barb Sanders:#2998 (09/01/96)

I am watching a man working hard, over and over trying to figure out what his dream symbols mean. I begin to have feelings of empathy and affection. In fact, I look him over and decide I wouldn't mind making love to him. I then tell him that I know what his dream symbols mean, because I dream the same ones. I tell him I am in lots of pain all the time, so the dreams where many people are hurting me and biting me is me hurting myself. I seem to be getting closer to him physically as I talk and I also become very sleepy, or I am pretending to be sleepy. It's like I'm drunk and it's kind of cute. He smiles at me and now my head is laying on his chest and we are cuddling. He says, "I love you." I say, "I know. And I love you." (153 words)
Barb Sanders:#2999 (09/01/96)

I am driving a car right behind a car that is making the road. It is the command car of the road construction crew. We are driving slow. It is hard to be patient. Finally after a long time it is made enough that we can go on. I am napping, I am tired. Now I wake up and Lydia, Caroline, and Delia are here. I now see the top of my head as if I am looking down on someone else's head. It is bald across the top part and there are big red welts, like my arthritis bumps on my elbows. I feel sick about it. I almost sense relief that I can wear wigs now and have pretty hair-dos. But I also feel bad I have to wear wigs. It's so false and uncomfortable. (137 words)

I am in a room and Archie comes in. He is wrinkled and wears half glasses perched on the end of his nose. He looks in his forties. He is annoyed with me. I think I took a class from him and he's not going to give me a passing grade. I sit over by a very huge fish tank, several hundreds of gallons big. I see some angel fish and others. Some of the fish I must have gotten from when I was married to Howard; others are newer. The water is very cloudy and murky. It hasn't been cleaned in a long time. (105 words)
Barb Sanders:#3001 (09/03/96)

I am in a room with lots of people, a classroom. A short funny guy, like on that TV Burt Reynolds's show, is the instructor. He is running around, full of high energy and talking non-stop. I am in the row chosen to do some role playing, some acting. I am given the role of being unmarried and having an important project to do (like write a book or play) and therefore I don't want to get married. I have more important things to do. He prompts me that it is my turn. I go up to the teacher's desk where another man is. We ad-lib. He says, "So are you getting married?" and I answer in my cute, feisty way, "Married!! Don't be silly. I've got these important projects to do." They love what a good actress I am. I go sit down. Now it is the next day and I pick up the newspaper. I see a huge picture of people seated, maybe in a stadium or an auditorium. I see a woman that looks a bit like me. I read the story and caption under the picture. It is about me and what a great job I did acting. I bask in the glory and tell my daughter, "Well, here's another newspaper story about me that my friends and acquaintances will see." I feel proud. (228 words)
Barb Sanders:#3002 (09/03/96)

There's the same little man as the previous dream. It's the next day. A friend of mine, like Marti S, is very upset with him. He had made some public remarks that indicate she isn't authentic or wasn't accurate. We go to his class again. I sit back in the room, wondering if he will see me and remember me. The room is very crowded. He comes in, prancing with energy. Marti raises her hand and he calls on her and she goes on and on, not making much sense, challenging him. He takes the challenge well, and appoints a row of students to help him test her and judge how she did. She says some words and he will check them out. Then he sees me and comes over by me. I see a picture of his two adorable children and his wife. He says, or I realize, that he is a wheelchair man. He loves women who are in wheelchairs. I am attracted to him, but don't want to disturb his family. He is attracted to me too. Now he is showing a film as educational evidence. I move to sit on a big double bed with a blue chenille bedspread. I walk over there, noticing I am walking pretty good. I sit. Later I feel the bed bouncing as he wiggles his way over next to me on the right side. He lays on his back, half slid off the bed, looking up at me. I see children in the movie. I wonder if they are his. I hear his voice doing the narration. (267 words)

I am in India. I am overwhelmed with all the sick people and I am trying to help heal them. A man asks me to his office to talk. He is attracted to me. He takes my hand. His hand is brown. He holds a red flower in his hand and he puts our hands together with the flower between us so that as we shake hands, the flower is crushed so that it's sweet perfume is on both of us. It is some courting ritual. I believe the man is an Indian doctor. I am distracted, with so much to do. (102 words)
Barb Sanders:#3004 (09/05/96)

I am trying to send a huge text file on the Internet to Russia. They are going to help me. But I begin to wonder if this is too big a text to be sent and if the Russians can be trusted to work with it and return it. Now, I am watching a group of women, young, who are hanging out having some kind of ritual party to get rid of the "losers" they had dated. There is some kind of container with a sign on it about the "losers." You can ritualistically put your "loser's" name in the pot. One woman is more aloof from the others. I see her leg as she steps out from the side to watch. (122 words)

I have fallen out of the sky, perhaps an airplane, and am lost up in the mountains in the deep snow. I feel like giving up. It's too much to imagine I can make it back down the mountain. Then I realize I must try. I crawl and struggle. Someone else is in a house trying to watch TV. She has a movie on one channel and another movie comes on. It is confusing. By the time I come down off the mountain, I have an injured leg. [BL] (88 words)
Barb Sanders:#3006 (09/08/96)

I am sitting on the ground. Abner, my cousin, comes over to me and sits beside me. He gently puts his arm around me. We have had to not be romantic all our lives because we are cousins. But now we are older and can't have children, so it's OK for us to be romantic and have a loving relationship. I feel strange, like this isn't right, and yet I am drawn to the soft, quiet, loving sense of it. Now Willie drives up and sees us. He is jealous. Now the three of us are in his car driving somewhere. They both love me. I sit between them. I love Abner best. (113 words)
Barb Sanders:#3007 (09/11/96)

I am looking through an old box of things and come across a newspaper clipping. I also see a paper I wrote on. The beginning word of each sentence created its own sentence, when you put them together. I chuckle to see my old childish way of coding words. I read the words. It says, "I am a playwright." I look at the newspaper clipping: a head and shoulders shot of me, like when I was the manager of the Fair Store in M City. The paragraph under it said I had received some awards for my writing. Some man, who is annoyed and jealous, says that I always get mentioned before and after banquet events. How come? I feel a little embarrassed. (123 words)
Barb Sanders:#3008 (09/11/96)

I am going to see some kind of event, maybe a fair or a sporting event. Jake may be with me. I walk down many, many stairs, looking for the place. It doesn't seem to be that many people around. I go into a room and a fun ride is there. I want to go on it, so I sit down on the dresser. There should be a basket like thing to sit in, but it's not there. A woman goes and gets a wire basket, white, and places it so I can put my feet in it and have better support that way. The ride begins and it is actually fun as the dresser swirls and twirls around the room. It is more exciting than I usually experience with this kind of ride. (134 words)
Barb Sanders:#3009 (09/12/96)

I am lying down in a car somewhere and three different people and a couple are trying to have sex with me. It is very unpleasant. There are no sexual feelings, just a sense of disgust and being used and forced. They get up and leave and one man is still there, and I say to him, "I hope that doesn't happen again." (63 words)
Barb Sanders:#3010 (09/12/96)

I am in a room and my stepfather and my "mother" and some other people are there. I am experiencing some pain on the inside of my mouth on the right cheek, like I bit it and it is sore. The stepfather is distant and not helpful as I point out my pain. [BL] (53 words)
Barb Sanders:#3011 (09/13/96)

Jerome comes into the room. He is having an affair with a woman, or maybe with me. I see his wife and feel wary. Jerome and I talk, exchanging some key or a lock on the sly. His wife has no idea. I think Jerome is very cute and good-looking. I am somewhat attracted to him and he to me. (60 words)

I see a data form. The name B. is typed out. There are other columns laid out, but when I push, or perhaps some other woman pushes the computer buttons, the columns shift around into different configurations and sizes. I am organizing something. I do it in chunks or blocks. [BL] (50 words)
Barb Sanders:#3013 (09/15/96)

I am in a huge Victorian house with other people. There are lots of kids. I am going down the halls and seeing groups of kids spilling out of the rooms and into the hallways. Now water is rushing in and I must run as fast as I can upstairs to the roof. I make it to the small windowed room at the very top. Now that room is like a space craft, NASA to be exact, hexagonal in shape, or the cone tip on the rocket. We must escape. I and some others are put into a suspended state, sort of like the beam-up thing in Star Trek. It disengages all our molecules, stores them and when we arrive at the new planet, which will support human life, we are reassembled. We travel hundreds of years and then I am reactivated. I guess earth was being destroyed and the smartest and best leaders, especially with good facilitating skills, were chosen to start the new home. (166 words)

I am going to have to travel since I now am in some military or spy organization. I look into the mirror at my hair. It is coal black and then I notice that only a small part of the front is black, the rest is my usual brown-gray color. A man offers to help me make my hair look better. I am alone and isolated and agree to let him help me. I shampoo my hair, standing up at the mirror. Then he shapes and cuts my hair. Now I am moving into my new quarters. I look out the window and see snow falling, a light dusting on the ground and the grass ends at the beginning of a giant wall of the other cement building. It's a big complex. I then look into the room and survey the sparse furniture, the lack of any decorations, etc., a single bed. I feel lonely. (155 words)
Barb Sanders:#3015 (09/17/96)

I am in a car, driving. I look ahead and see the road is slathered with oil. I guess they are repaving the road. I hesitate, thinking I won't go because I'll ruin the car and besides, maybe the road doesn't go through and I'll get stuck. Then I see another car coming through from the other way and know I can get through. I see the oil is splattered in a thick layer on the front of the car from them going too fast and splashing it all over themselves. I decide to try it, but slower. I don't feel good about the decision, but decide to do it anyway. I start driving. It is slick. Now I am in the back seat of a limo with gangsters. I have been captured by the son of a gangster. They are going to kill me because my father, also a gangster, killed the son's father's brother. Now they seek revenge. He is pursuing me, but he is also attracted to me, and somewhere deep in me I am attracted to him, but I am running from him for my life. I also profess hatred of him. I am aloof and distant. Now I am told to sit in the front seat. I do so; there are maybe six gangster guys in the two back seats. I fall asleep. Now the car stops and he opens the passenger side door to wake me up, but he watches my sleeping face, falling in love with me. He leans down and slowly and sweetly kisses me. I respond to him lovingly and then wake up to realize what I've done and go back to my frozen, distant posture. But now he knows I love him too. We have arrived at a small shabby cabin by the beach. It is empty of any furnishings. I am standing in the living room, near a window that looks out to the beach front. The father is in the back bedroom. The son goes in there, walks into a closet and changes his clothes. The father says, "We are going to kill you, because your father killed my brother." I am watching the son in the closet and I say, "Maybe you should force me to be his maid (was thinking wife). I would hate that above all else." The father likes this idea. He pushes it up one more level and says, "You will be my son's wife," thinking that would be hell for me and a suitable revenge. Now the father is gone and I see the son approaching me. I back up, trying to stay away from his radiant charm because it is so hard to resist. I am backed literally into a corner of the room and I turn my back to him, my face into the corner. He walks sensually up to me, puts his hands on my shoulders and turns me back around to face him and slowly, like in the movies, kisses me. I try to resist but my true feelings leaks out into that kiss. He smiles down at me and whispers, "That's all I wanted to know." (529 words)

I am trying to convince this man, who is aloof and does not respect me, that I am not a sexual slut as he seems to be convinced I am. I am looking at a scrapbook with each of my previous boyfriends in it, in chronological order. Each one has a fond memory but the overall feeling of each one is that he was a mistake. There was something wrong with each one, bad choices. (75 words)

Ernie is seated at my computer and working on something to help me get things straightened out. I am at the back of the computer looking at the connections. Something needs to be plugged in again and he says he will do it for me and I say, "No, I need to learn to do it." I plug a yellow round wire end into a tiny yellow hole, and the same with a black one and then I hesitate with the pink one and Ernie says, "Yes, that's right, you've got it." I grin and say, "I only watched it being done before. It's hard to remember how to do things unless you do them yourself." He agrees. I then find my wheelchair, which is sort of folded up like a manual. I struggle to unfold it myself. The backpack, or recharger, is stuck and Ernie reaches over and unhooks it so I can continue.

I am staying over night at Ernie and Ginny's, although the house I've never seen before (in real life). I had been trying to sleep, but can't. I had been watching a TV program about a nine hundred and something pound man in a manual wheelchair. He used to be a football player. Now I get up and go downstairs. I am in my nightie, so I hope the front room curtains are pulled. Then it looks like they aren't; I rush up to close them. And I see it was an optical illusion, they really were closed. Now I turn on the TV again to continue watching the show about the fat, disabled man. He moves with grace, the blubber on him sort of bouncing and flowing around him. Someone thinks or the narrator says that it is kind of fascinating to watch. You gain some measure of respect or empathy when you get to know him. Now Ernie comes in from outside, he and Ricardo. He is surprised to see me up at 4:00 in the morning. I tell him I couldn't sleep so I got up for awhile. He asks how I'm doing on the dictionary. I say I'm still writing. He asks me why. I say because it's a way of talking out-loud to myself to hear what I'm thinking. Then I realize he said dictionary. I say, "Oh, I thought you meant journal." I then say, "The reason I'm still working on the dictionary is that I am a poor speller. It's just a disability I have. I have to check each word's spelling, the endings and if it's in the right nook." Ernie is a bit disdainful; that it takes me so long. He mentions he had a couple of accidents and hurt himself. He then had a quick vision. He said three things, one of which was an eagle and a feather. I am impressed with this powerful vision. I know he will look down on me for this, but I say, "It is similar to a dream, isn't it?" Ernie shrugs his shoulders and says nonchalantly, "Of course, you'd try and find meaning in it. It's just that in my family people die of this and it got me to thinking." I say, sympathetically, "Ah, well, in my family they die of stomach cancer. We each have our thing to die with." Ernie then wants to know if I can sleep single, meaning can I join a person on the couch hide-a-bed. He is concerned for me and wants me to get my sleep. I say, "No thanks. I'll stay up awhile and then go back to my bed upstairs." He asks again, a different way. I decline. He shrugs and says good night. (462 words)

I am walking around a sort of track and field shaped area. It's a store. I need to go pee and find a bathroom. I sit and pee and pee, but can't get relief. I hear the loud sound of peeing and feel the pee going down my leg. I get up, a bit uncomfortable about all that urine all over my dress and in my moccasins. I walk on. I see a deli counter, sort of a Safeway Bakery. I find a bag of rolls or muffins and decide to get one. I read the ingredients to make sure there is no sugar in them. I continue strolling. As I walk, I nearly step on the end row boat of a string of boats. It is a rowing team. Justin, Lucy's husband, is learning to row and is lying down on his back in the last boat (like it's a train of them). I smile and apologize for nearly stepping on him. I think I embarrassed him and feel bad about that. I choose a sweater to buy. I put it on and notice it is quite huge, longer than my dress. I see Delores M and she has a sweater like it. It is pink knit, half sleeves. I notice I can see my dress underneath the sweater. Delores is telling me how she fought with the telephone company over a one thousand dollar bill and they agreed to remove 300 dollars of it. She was quite proud of that. I congratulate her. I say to Delores, "It looks like I'd better always wear a dress under this thing. After all, my boyfriend is disabled, but he's not blind." A group of young women burst out laughing at my amusing joke. I grin and stroll on. I still have to pee, so as I am walking, I pee down my leg. I am a bit embarrassed about the urine smell and being in public. I sit at a cafe table and three men join me; I continue peeing, hoping they don't notice. (344 words)

I am at some college function. The entertainment, two black men who are blind, comes. I happen to be sitting right where they sit down. I am pleased and say things like, "My friend Lucy is blind." The black man, with thick lips and dreadlocks, looks toward me scornfully and says, "Who asked you?" Then he starts picking on me. He asks me how come my lips look so funny, all pursed out when I say words. I start to explain it's a combination of entertainment and it's also sort of the way my lips just move. Then I say to him, "Well, you should talk. Look at your lips, all thick." We do this back and forth for a while. Now I am running on a track. There is a cluster of uniformed track women running ahead. I, the dreamer, watch them pass and I look way beyond them down the track and see me dead last. I have a limp and I am slow, but I am up and I am running. I feel good about that. Now I go to my dorm room, only I accidentally go to the 7th floor and have to walk back down some stairs. I find the name Vfabray and know that's my roommate's name. I go in and see belated Xmas presents for Charla have arrived. I open them, and notice my roommate has already opened some and put the tiger lily flowers up in a hanging plant thing. It looks pretty, but I wish she'd waited for Charla. I look out the window and see some things like kites flying around, not making it very high and crashing to the ground. They are not damaged. (285 words)

I am sitting on a couch. A friend, Keith, also a friend of Derek's (not in real life), comes in and behind him is walking, with some effort, Derek. I am surprised. He comes in and talks a bit. I respond back in a friendly manner. He is still uptight about our breakup and non-connection of the last few months. Keith comes over and sits beside me on the couch. Derek walks over and puts his face between our faces. I kiss him on the cheek. He is still distant, but then he keeps talking and I keep talking and then he kisses me on the lips in a genuine sweet kiss. (112 words)

I have two or three female roommates. We are going to a wedding or a party. One woman is interested in another woman. I look at her face. It is a fishy monster face like those odd fish creatures on Star Trek movie, with bulbous eyes on the side of their heads. The other woman laughs in her face and says, "No thanks, I have this man in mind." We are at the party, in a room. The women search out their men and they are accepted, all but me. I watch the people; I walk around. Now a group of them are forming a circle. It is the group of people with disabilities, although they look normal enough. A tall man is talking. I like him. He is across the circle from me. As the circle moves and more people join, he and I are side by side. Everyone joins hands. His hand is warm, very warm. He glances down at me and smiles because he just felt how warm my hand was too. I like it. The feeling is we will get together later. Now I have a baby in front of me, the circle is gone and I am going to dress him in the garment I knitted for him, only as I try to put it on him, I see it has three legs. And the middle leg is off the needles and is unraveling. I try to save the stitches. I hole up a dress for him to approve, but it is a boy baby. He's not interested in a dress. This isn't working out. (270 words)

I am attempting to write or do a major work on a screen, a TV screen. Maybe I'm writing a script. It's a big one, and important. Now two other screens are on, TV screens, and they are interfering with my work. The script is disintegrating into greeking letters, nonsense symbols. I try to save the script or program before it all disappears into nonreadable form. (66 words)

There is a rowboat and a rat on the rowboat. I feel concern that I want to help the person on the rowboat by getting rid of the rats. Now I see a man putting the live rat in his mouth head first and realize his way of helping is to eat the rats. Ugh. (55 words)

I am traveling down into the earth somehow. There are dangerous paths I must tread. Then one section would end at a white wall. I'd look for the beginning of the next segment. I look up at the ceiling and see a pull string. I pull it down and a small hatch hole appears with a pull down ladder which looks and sounds like a wooden toy with slats of wood on a string that cascade down into a different configuration. These slats then create a ladder. I walk up, pulling myself up the ladder. Now I am in a dangerous part where there are poisonous jungle snakes. I pull out a large knife. I see black shiny snakes coming out from under cups and dishes and statues on a shelf. I have to climb up on that shelf to go to the next level. A center statue is in the way and I decide I don't want that one anyway and choose another and then another. Someone says or I think, "Do they need an Elvis statue to get on with it?" Six snakes come out and I chop off their heads simultaneously. They are very beautiful with vibrant colors, turquoise and so on. Now I get to the next section. Each section is different. This one has people who are very aggressive and belligerent. I must out-bluster them to survive. I do so, easily. I have arrived. Now it is time to go back. I hold a sleeping bag-like thing and am zipping up the end, while it is still rolled up, making a spiral path for the zipper. Somehow this means I've discovered a faster, safer way through without taking those dangerous paths. But now a very noisy, aggressive boy whirls toward me. He wants my attention. He wants to go with me. A woman chuckles and said she found him at the site (setting) called Cathedral and his name is Daniel O'Flannery. We laugh at the irony of an obvious Irish Catholic boy being from a setting called the Cathedral. The boy has red hair and freckles and is cute and wholesome-looking. I tell him to leave me alone. His demanding, attention-getting behavior won't work with me. I then decide to go back through the paths. He follows me. I at first am concerned he'll be harmed, but then he asked for it. I warned him. So I decide this will be a lesson for him and go on, being aggressive and belligerent to the dangerous people on this path, in order to safely get through. I realize from his distant yelling he's scared and will get hurt. I call down the spiral to him, "Just be your fierce, aggressive self on this section. It will work for you." He does it and catches up to me. I turn to him and say, "This next section is the opposite. You have to be clever and quiet." He tries to do so. And we successfully return through all the different sections. (504 words)

I am involved in a family presentation of a play, perhaps one of mine. I can't find my script. The presentation time is in two hours and I search over and over, all around. Paulina asks me what I'm doing. I say, "Looking for my scripts." I can't remember my lines. I feel apprehensive. No one is very helpful. I ask where we are going to perform. I need to experience the stage area so I know what I'm working with. She shows me the back yard where a line is drawn. I say, "There?" pointing to a small cement square. "No," she says. "That line." I say, "That line? Is it the back stage boundary or the front?" She says, "The back boundary." I keep looking for the script, getting more desperate as time passes. (136 words)

I am in a church, attending a small town service. I think I'm there because a movie crew is in town. A number of famous movie actors, men, are there. I am sitting in the back. I really have to go pee and I get up at the end of the first section and walk. I have the directions that you go to the Splash room and find the restroom. I see a cafeteria room where people are getting refreshments. I see a line of women in a room and correctly guess that's the women's room. I get in line. I really have to pee bad. The last booth opens up, they each have flowered curtains for doors. I go in and it's a white, tall plastic kitchen trash can under a counter. I squinch under the counter and sit and begin to pee. My bladder is very full. I hesitate and then I tell myself quite realistically, "I am awake, it's OK to pee." I pee and pee, trying not to slop any out of the round container. Finally I am done, but I feel uncomfortable, like I still need to pee and that maybe it wasn't OK to pee, maybe I wasn't awake. A woman is talking to me very friendly and we are chatting. I reach for a toilet tissue and she hands me one, I look to make sure it wasn't her lunch as she is standing there eating her refreshments on the top of the counter. I notice a ham slice in my hand and hand it back to her. Now I am stuffing my changes of clothes back into a white plastic sack. It's time to get back to the church service. Now an older woman approaches the woman I am talking to. She says she's been chosen as her sponsor. The woman is distressed because the older woman is tough and won't let her get away with anything. She is, I now realize, addicted to something. The older woman smiles and says knowingly, "Yes, that's why I've been chosen." I leave now, kind of escaping the woman's company after discovering she is addicted. Now I return, only it's a swim pool, not a church. I peel off my clothes. Jack Lemmon and other men are in the pool already. Jack Lemmon laughs and calls out a joke for me to hear about male chauvinists. I chuckle and check to see if my bikini halter swim top is covering me OK. I have very flat breasts like Angel. I dive in and begin to swim laps hard and fast like an athlete. The church congregation begins to chant numbers, counting the strokes to go across the pool. I work hard and make good time and the crowd cheers. I am pleased about my prowess. (470 words)

I have returned to school, university. I've been here for years. It is getting old. I think I will go to the first meeting of the Disability Student group. I start off in that direction, going up some stairs. I see Rochelle. We talk. She asks me where I am going and I tell her. She says, "Oh, boring. I'm not going to that thing. It's always the same." I agree it is often boring, but it is a good opportunity to meet the new, young disabled people, the activists. I mention to Rochelle that I am looking for a TV set, another one, for maybe $100. We see some advertisements posted on a board and I go up to look. Some TV's are mentioned for $40. But I decide to wait, because they won't be fancy enough to do what I want them to do. I never make it to class. (152 words)

Dan Dailey and a woman are lovers. They sweetly and deeply love each other and so much enjoy being in each other's company. They are making love. Later, Dan comes up to the woman and smiles and says, "Hey, like the mama kitty and the mama bird, you are the mama...." I don't remember it exactly. But it refers to earlier scenes where a cute kitty cat was taking care of its young and the same for a mama bird. It meant she was a very loving mama kind of person and he honored that in her.

I have so many books that they would fill up two huge library-sized rooms. I and a child like Charla are trying to walk down some stairs that are like piles of books. She had taken a 5 milligram dose of Cortisone and I was worried about this habit. I said, "That's like taking speed. That's not good for you." (60 words)

I am an enthusiastic and creative lawyer. I am a bit like Debra Winger. My client won't give me much, if any, information. He gives me non-verbal hints. At one point he acts like he had an allergy so I know that the man on the witness stand had an allergy and used this to ferret out important information. At one point, I put fake, funny, pink pig ears on my client, and a fake pig nose. I dramatically and humorously use this to make another important point. I do well. Now I am walking down a corridor and behind me comes a good-looking man who tells me he saw my work in court and admires me. We talk, enjoying each other's company. We then become boyfriend and girlfriend. I think his name is Roger, or perhaps my previous boyfriend was named Roger. Now I go to my home and he is with me. We are talking about my previous boyfriend and his flaws. Someone knocks on the door and I open it. It is an elephant, a big one, and three different gurus. One wears a golden Indian outfit. Another is in modest white Indian costume. They want me to feed the elephant. They ask me if I have a large gallon pan. I search around and find a big metal mixing bowl. They say that will be fine. Meanwhile I am having a sort of discussion/argument with my lawyer boyfriend. (242 words)

I think I am at school, maybe like the community college, but the buildings do not look familiar. I am inside and walking around. I see myself playing my violin and I am playing the Hungarian Dance # 5. I am doing very well, which surprises me because I had worked so hard on that piece as a child and made so many errors then. I am cautious of the places where I had trouble before, but manage to do them right this time. The audience loves me and is enthusiastic. Now I am done with that and walking to meet Bonnie. I go the wrong way and have to back track in to meet her by the elevators. On my way there, I go to a table where magazines and so on are. I pick up one that has the picture of me doing the Hungarian Dance solo on the cover. It was a special report edition. I don't look like me at all. I have short black hair framing my face. I feel a bit uncomfortable that I don't look like me, so how will people know that is me? At the same time, I am also pleased to be so prominently displayed. Now I am going down a road. I am in Russia, I think. Another woman and two men are sort of joining me. One man, very good-looking, likes me. He cooks something for me. I say something about how far I always seem to have to travel to get to the festival or whatever we are going to. I say, "And now, we're in Russia where everything is so far away from everything. If the festival were in the next city, it'd be a far distance to travel." The man hands me a grilled cheese sandwich with special cheese on the outside of it too. He grumbles a bit, teasing me, that I could have had the steak sandwich he made, but no, I didn't like that. I only liked the cheese. I nibble on the sandwich. It is tasty. (345 words)

At first I am with strange beings, perhaps aliens, or spiritual beings or simply another planet. Things are done differently there. I must get used to the terrain. I am then called out of bed and outside to rehearse a disability skit with perhaps Bonnie. She holds my hands as she is up high on a cardboard box and I am down below calling to her. I am pulling at her and falling down. I ask her loudly why we don't have accessibility yet. "How long has it been since 1983 when it was law and we still don't have it?" I then pause and suggest to her we do this skit out on the parking lot where people could actually see it. She doesn't want to and I drag her out there, cardboard box and all. This is going to annoy the bosses of the place I work at, a car dealership or manufacturing place. The personnel office is looking for me now. A man questions me and wants to know if I know what cars they sell. I say, "The 2400 (something) does really well. And in the used cars we sell lots of Pontiacs." Then I start to travel through the rooms, which are full of shoebox-sized cardboard boxes all piled loosely on top of each other. How I travel is to step into a box and move to the next pile of boxes, like I go through a door into a room. A phone rings and the office people ask me another question. Then they want to know if Carmen Jones is there. I say, "Just a minute," and look in the next room where a light-colored black man is sitting in a manual wheelchair (like in movie I saw yesterday called Inside Moves). I ask him if he is Carmen Jones. He says, "Yes." (309 words)

I am lying in bed and Jock comes into the room and lies down with me. He is quiet and I realize he wants to make love to me. I feel his penis hard against my vagina. I am surprised since he is gay but I love him as a friend and I agree we can do this. I ask him if he has a rubber. He says, "Of course." I later wonder if he put it on and leave it to him to have done so. I don't want AIDS, but I don't push to make sure he is wearing the rubber. His penis is a bit small and he has some difficulty getting it in. He is a bit annoyed with me and asks me to change my position, maybe put a pillow under my hips to make it easier for him. I begin to move around and he is excited and I am uptight and can't relax and enjoy it. He has an orgasm and I am left frustrated, hardly aroused. I am disappointed and feel a bit used. Now it is New Year's Eve and people are celebrating out in the streets. I see Jock very sad and morose and I realize he is thinking of suicide. He lies down in a large puddle of water and sinks down into it. I sit on the edge and watch, thinking he won't go through with it and waiting for him to sputter to the surface. I watch the air bubbles rise. Then he does float up and I am shocked to learn he did try for it and isn't breathing. I grab him and try to do CPR, but now he isn't a person but a fold up case like a crimping iron. I can't find any lungs so I keep pressing first this side and then that, unfolding him as best I can. It isn't working. I then pull him into a diesel truck. He is a human again and I try to call 911. Lots of other people are ahead of me and it is hard to reach help. We finally get through. Now I am walking back down a flight of stairs and a woman is telling me of the other women he had sexual affairs with while cheating on Melinda. Sandy is the name of one of them. I don't remember the name of the other. I feel cheapened and used and sad. (410 words)

Two men, one tiny and one large, are in partnership to poison us. I am a member of a rich family and the large man is like a butler to us. We have to become like detectives to figure out what they are up to. They have a spittle-like white substance they are using to poison us with. Somehow, the man in my family manages to poison them with their own poison. It takes a while to act, so when they learn they'd been poisoned, they suddenly stop chasing us and decide to go to the theatre. We don't trust them and follow to keep an eye on them. The woman of the family, Polly, comes with us. I am sort of her. We follow them outside the mansion. A large group of our employees are out there, doing yard work and cleaning things and laying down a layer of dirt for the garden or the patio. They stare at us in disbelief, because we are not dressed up fancy like we always do, but in ordinary comfortable clothes, even though we are going to the theatre. I (Polly) pause, then say, "You people are sure snobs. This is a style called comfort." They then laugh and relax a bit. I say, "I bought it at the best store in town for this sort of thing," and I name a local, cheap clothing store. They joke back. Now the two poisoned men don't feel well and decide to come back in the mansion. We try to follow them, still not trusting them to cause us damage. The large man has changed into a robe and is laying face down on a couch. The tiny man is locked in the bathroom feeling ill, so we assume. The large man had said something to me on the way back in about how they had managed to take Polly with them, meaning they had poisoned her on the sly. I try to find the piece of paper in a sheaf of them in my hand to prove what they said, because I didn't really catch it all and was unsure if they said that or not. I need to know because if it is true, I must tell Polly. I can't find it. Finally the large man says it's all right. We didn't poison Polly. (392 words)

I am in a sort of classroom, only it's sort of like my house. I am explaining to the instructor (male) that he doesn't understand, what I'm dealing with is more complex than just the English language (like parts of speeches). I am working with Natural Language Programming. As I tell him this, I am moving a broken office chair (the back rest is lopsided and partially unattached) to another room and out of the way, only where I'm putting it is sort of where my computer would be in my house.

I am visiting someone, maybe Corinne at M City, only I don't recognize the house. I am looking for my pills because I've just realized that I didn't pack any and I see that my mother didn't either. I notice she did pack all my jewelry, which I never wear. How annoying. I start to dig into all my old purses, which apparently my mother packed too, because, as I explain to some woman, I often don't clean out my old purses and I am used to carrying spare pills just in case, but no luck. I find a few pills, which when I look closely, are merely vitamin like things, round and yellow. I sigh. I need to call my doctor and have him prescribe a temporary supply of pills for three days, which is how long I'm going to visit here. I can't remember how to use the phone. My mother tells me to push the save tab on a card index file. I say, "Oh sure, I remember now. I push it and pick up a brochure and put it up to my ear like it's the receiver. I complain I can't hear very well. There are too many people talking in the room. So my father pushes me back, like I'm in a chair and he is shoving the chair with me in it until I am back in a roomy clothes closet. I can't remember the doctor's name. I remember Dr. A. and say, "But they switched me to some other doctor, a Doctor ... Mendelsohn. I am ambivalent about which doctor to call. I finally decide on the new one since the paperwork would go more smoothly, although it would be nice to talk to Dr. An. because he knows my case. I notice I am naked and have an excessive amount of long dark brown armpit hair and pubic hair. I am a bit surprised. I've never had so much hair there before. I used to shave. I must have let it grow for a long time. I am younger, maybe in my 30's. My body is pudgy but firm and soft, a nice pretty body. (363 words)

I meet up with Dylan. We are talking but there is some tension between us. Perhaps I feel competition or we are arguing. As we are talking, we are in some big institutional building of some sort, a woman comes over and turns her face away from Dylan and practically whispers, "I'm pregnant." I hear her, but Dylan doesn't and he continues talking. I interrupt him and say, "Did you hear her?" I make her repeat it. Dylan looks at me like, "Can you take over with this client?" He wants my help. I reluctantly agree. I say, "Can we use your office?" He says yes. I start to enter a room but he says, "No, my office is moved now." We go around the corner to another room. I open the door and see it is a long l-shaped room with lots of wooden chairs and desks. Some women from another department are also working in there. I look over the situation and ask the client if it is OK with her that we work in here, because having other people around could be a confidentiality problem. She reluctantly agrees. I see another room, used as a classroom, and now the women have used it as a coat room. I pull her in there. I say we may be occasionally interrupted. So we sit and she starts doing all kinds of avoidance behaviors, walking around, chatting about other things, etc. I firmly say to her, "You have three (I was contemplating five but decided that was too long) minutes to quiet down and work or I will leave." She ignores me and continues but at precisely three minutes has managed to sit quietly. I start to work with her about being pregnant and she starts up again. This time I give her two minutes. She doesn't stop and I go get my coat and scarf and start to leave. Then I suddenly turn and get right up in her face and fix her with a knowing stare. Her eyes become big and scared. "Uh-huh," I say. "You just confirmed it. You are a lesbian and that is the issue you really want to work with." I feel quite proud, even a bit arrogant about this amazing bit of intuition. I start to leave and she tries to follow. I say to her, a bit harshly, "I want to make it clear. We are not counselor and client anymore. We are not, I repeated, relationship and client...I mean, counselor and client." I am saying this to her so she clearly understands I am not working with her professionally so she won't be confused if we talk about things informally. (449 words)

I am changing my clothes because Darryl and his bride came to our family dinner and I want to look nice. I go into a room and find some girl clothes, maybe Charla's hanging in the closet. I can't seem to find my own clothes. I see a large suitcase on a bed with a pile of rumpled clothes in it and dig around. I find a pair of jeans that may be big enough for my Buddha belly. I start to put them on when a small wooden sliding door opens and Doug is peeking in to see if he can see me naked. I tell him to get away. I am mad at him. I look again at the jeans and see they are way too big. They are Kyle's jeans. That won't do. I am feeling desperate. I want to look nice and I don't seem to have anything nice to wear. I do find a pretty rusty brown top and skirt and I have a petticoat on. I am telling some woman there that maybe the petticoat will show under the skirt because it is too long. She says, "It's fine," but I take it off. I actually do look fairly nice. I return to the dinner where a jumble of food is all over the table. I shyly talk with Darryl and his bride. I am thinking that it has been so many years but it is fitting we are together again. There is also some bad feeling that it is going to be wrong for us to get married. We would not be good for each other after all. (275 words)

Eric gives me some papers to finish up for him. I am required to paint some pasty kind of stuff over the text or pictures and then rub it onto another paper with a roller. I see some baby raccoons, a cute big raccoon and some text that is too big for the size paper I should rub it onto. I struggle. Sometimes the substance I am using is thick, gooey and black, but sometimes it's a rusty color. I am worried I am not doing it right and may ruin it for Nate. I peel some of them off to see if it is working. I can't tell. Some are all right, some have black goop all over both sides, like carbon paper. (124 words)

I am visiting the B's. Ernie is talking with some man and I am lying on a couch listening. I ask where Ginny is. He says in the bedroom. She'll be out in a minute. I am petting a large white and spotted cat with a Mohawk fur cut. I chuckle at the cat. I remember that Fluffy is gray and wonder where she is. Now the boys, Ricardo, Rigo and some of their friends pull me out onto a play area like a skating rink in a park. I am on a skateboard with all my things in my lap. I have knitting and clothes for warmth. It is winter. They are laughing and pulling me around and around. It is fun. I say, "Wait a minute, let me check my knitting." I see it has fallen under me and pull it out. One needle has all the stitches on it. The second needle is pulled out of the blue yarn. I try to put the stitches back on the needle as the boys continue to drag me around. Now Ernie is laughing and sitting squatted down like on a cold day, rubbing his hands. Ginny then walks up to me in a huge clown suit like a cat with a Mohawk. I say, "Are you on stilts?" and look and I see she is standing on my wooden crutches like they are stilts. We are all having fun. (240 words)

I am in a hospital. I have a female roommate, sort of like Michelle Pfeiffer. I am being released and so is she, but then she comes back to tell me she has to have a surgery and can't leave yet. Her surgery will happen on the 21st. I say, "Too bad," and she leaves for another room. I wish, after she is gone, I had asked for her name and address so I could write her. Not that I wanted to, but that is what people do and I should have. I am packing up the files I had been working on while in the hospital, the Hollywood information on movies I'd been watching. Then Grandma Agnes comes in, much slimmer than she usually was, and asked me why I wasn't at the family gathering at her house yesterday. I say, embarrassed and caught, "I was busy doing stuff." So she, two aunts and my father come in to visit. They sit in a circle on chairs and I am lying down on a couch. We all go to sleep during our conversation. I wake up and so do they, and I feel embarrassed like I should have been more attentive. But I also think it is amusing that we all fell asleep together. Some visit! (217 words)

I am getting into a group of women who are going into a bleachers area to sing group songs. I don't know what holiday it is, but this is a usual holiday thing to do. I and Andrea are trying to catch up with our group, but get lost and end up with a group of swimmers and divers. There is a swimming pool to the right, and in front of our bleachers is a pool used as the stage area. I watch a scene where a man and a woman get in a small rectangular rowboat and sing as we all sing the chorus. A wave or two comes up and splashes the woman and she mimes jumping up real quick so it doesn't get her all wet on her bottom. I and Aunt Bridget are sitting on the right side of the bleachers. It is very crowded. We sing along with the group but don't know the songs. I notice my voice is clear and pretty and I seem to be able to keep up with the words by listening carefully. I look over to the bleachers on my left and up and see a small group of people in green sort of fish costumes with green makeup on their faces. They are pretty and all the same. Now muffins and cookies and cakes are being served to the crowd and I can see they are moist and sweet and would taste really good, better than if we'd stayed with our own group. I look to my right and notice the water is all gone from the swim pool. There had been some girls taking lessons there. [BL] (279 words)

I am in a house I've never seen before, a big one. I'm in the kitchen. I'm hungry and looking around for something to eat. Pickings are slim. I hear Howard outside in the front yard telling the neighborhood children not to play in our yard. I hear his boring, dead voice droning on about civic responsibility. I idly wonder if I could sleep with him now and have sex. I feel forgiving and try to imagine if I could do it without feeling horrible. It is a possibility. He comes in and I am at the sink rinsing a bunch of spaghetti and pretzels in the sink. He suggests I could go out and talk to the kids sometime. I say, "I agree I need something to do, but giving civic lessons to the kids isn't going to be it." Then I ask if he is hungry. He says yes, a little bit. I then hesitate and then ask if I can fix him some toast, or even fry a couple of eggs. I am relieved when he says no. I see a plastic container full of cooked spinach and ask him if that is his. He says yes. I see that he is on his belly on the floor, digging around in a cupboard for something. I ask him what he's trying to get. He says salt. I see him pick it up awkwardly with his teeth. I take it from his mouth and use it to salt his spinach and then my spaghetti. I notice he had put an unshucked ear of corn on my plate. I touch it. It is cool, and uncooked too. I decide not to salt it yet, but cook it first. (289 words)

I am on a beach and I see the actor John Ritter and we talk. He says, "Remember me?" I say yes. Then we are lying down and he puts his arm over me and kisses me. Then he gently says, "I know this upsets you, so it's OK if we don't make love." I say, touched, "If I were going to do it with anyone, it would be you." He is touched. Then I say, "And I want it to be you." We kiss again and then we get up to go to his hotel room. But first he notices that the ocean has come up over a high sand dune hill and we get concerned because it could all come roaring down on us and it would be dangerous, so we begin to run back toward the hotel. We have to cross the "nuclear fields" first (a patch of unmowed pasture). As we are approaching an embankment we'll have to go up and over, it begins to rain hard. We laugh at the irony that we are fated to get wet somehow (baptism?). Water pours out through the apple trees we are under. We are concerned it will be hard to get through all the blackberry vines on the embankment, but then we see a few wooden steps and easily get up to the road. We enter the hotel. He is the manager and works there, so he comes in later than me and waits down the hall. I have two empty champagne glasses in one hand and am wet from the rain and wear a sleeveless T-shirt and look sexy and cute. I come past the desk and come to him and he smiles. I say, "Was I obvious?" He says, "Yes," laughing gently. Now we walk to his room and I suddenly remember or he reminds me that I left Charla in a room alone sleeping. I feel guilt and hope she is all right. We get in his room and for some reason he's upset and says he can't do it now. I understand but am disappointed. He sleeps on a couch with the couch pillows stacked up, but it's real uncomfortable. I am asleep on the bed. Then in his sleep, he gets up and stumbles over to the bed and before you know it, we roll over into each other's arms and make love (no sexual feelings, but contentment and comfort). (408 words)

I and my handicapped boyfriend are being ostracized because of our relationship. He is younger than me and handicapped, so I have been kicked out of school, all my money taken from me and no place to live. I do not give up my boyfriend though. I only have one privilege left. I can attend one class at school. I can't participate, but I can attend. I go there. No one speaks to me. I feel shame because I used to be quite popular and influential. I feel pride also in not backing down. I sit up in the highest row. The seats are like wooden, old theatre seats. The class is beginning. Down in the center is a group of students who are portraying judge and jury and lawyers. A young man is first to present his question or debate issue. He asks how come there aren't any pretty women for him to ask out in his small town and is this fair? I wonder to myself how fair is it that he isn't all that good-looking. How arrogant. Now a woman, like Mirabelle, reminds the group they haven't done the Bible thing and people pull out their Bibles. They begin to recite the Lord's Prayer. I start to do it from memory to be a part of the group, even though I think this is silly. A tiny disabled woman in a wheelchair behind me (maybe has osteoporosis) sarcastically uses silly words to the Lord's Prayer to show her defiance to this issue. I want to join her and would like for her to approve of me, and I want to join the group and have them approve of me. It's a dilemma. Now a young man walks up to a young woman next to me and wants to sit with her. He likes her. Then they change their seats and go down to a front row. I watch them as he tries to shyly move closer to her and she realizes he wants to hug and she moves closer to him and so on. Now one of the center group people calls on a woman on my right. She is a nun with short dark brown hair. In a pageboy kind of cut. She says she's not sure she can share her case because it isn't... and she can't remember the word. I supply it for her, "copyrighted." I am ignored. (404 words)

I am going to the Doctor's office. I see Dr. A having a cup of coffee. He is seated in a wooden school desk, the type with a wooden arm on one side. He sees me and asks me to have a cup of coffee with him. He is gentle and pleasant, seeming to want my company. We chat for awhile. He pats me on the arm and says sweetly, "I love you." He doesn't mean man/woman, but friendship. I say, "I love you too." He goes on. Then I remember I need a refill on my cortisone. I go in. A woman doctor says she can fill the prescription. It is a shot. I really live in some other town but decide to go ahead and get this month's shot now and save time. She is friendly with her women patients; she is sort of New Age. She now has a cream that looks like shaving cream and raises my blouse to expose my upper belly just below my breasts. This is the correct spot for the application of the cream. I am concerned that she might put too much on, how does it time itself for a whole month, and so on. She asks me how much I take and I say, "Four milligrams a day." I sort of feel this isn't right, but I can't remember any other number that is correct. She rubs the cream into my skin and that's that. There is no pain, and it's done. Then she offers a raffle ticket to me and two other women to go to a party and enjoy ourselves. After we are done, we can get reimbursed for the cost of the ticket by my brother Dwight. (290 words)

We had a wonderful time at the party and it is 2 or 3 in the morning. It is time to go. The other two women insist I call Dwight right now and get our raffle ticket reimbursement. I say, "It's too late." They insist, so I try to find his number. I say, "He hasn't got a number of his own," and then I remember he's married now and not living with my parents. I find the number. I don't feel good about this. I wake him up and tell him what we want. He says gently but firmly, "No, that's not fair. It was her raffle ticket. Why should I have to pay out of my own pocket?" I can see the reasoning on this and feel bad and caught between Dwight and the two women. I explain to them. (142 words)

I am feeling very ill. My daughter Ellie had been very ill with the flu. I guess it was my turn now. I am semi-lying in an overstuffed chair. I look down and see both my legs are in one leg hole of a huge man's briefs. I am embarrassed. I notice my fat belly. I am naked, but the flu and the fever is so bad I can barely move. Ellie comes over to me and leans close. I feel her take something in her mouth and put it in me somehow. It is a hard lump of something I can feel and move around in my belly. It is very uncomfortable. I get up with difficulty and try to walk. I had seen a woman that looks like a witch woman and I need to go to her. Now I am on a toy train and it has rubber tires and as I drive it around the narrow wooden structure, the wooden gates are too low and I have to think my way through. I finally arrive where the witch woman is. Lots of people are sick. I find her lying on her face in a kind of trance as she works with someone else. I tell her my daughter put this horrible thing in me and I am sick. She works with me and gets it out for me. I get back on the train for a ride. (241 words)

I am in a some kind of McDonald place where it caters to kids. I am ordering some hamburgers and so on. There are toys there to buy as well. A girl is looking at a set of baby clothes all in the same soft orange color. I leaf through them as they are presented in a book like form. Now I see my parents. I notice that my mother is quite tall, nearly as tall as my father is, but they still look good together. I notice how regal she stands and looks. Then I notice she has a bald swath through her pretty hair. She is delightedly sniffing the bags of hamburgers and exclaiming how wonderful they smell. Somewhere, either earlier in this dream or perhaps another dream, is a short pudgy man with really bad hair, sort of fuzzy and tough and grows in spots. He shows me the back row of his hair how unkempt it grows and sighs because he likes me and feels his hair will turn me away from him. Now I or my father sees some notice or advertisement about a piece of real estate where people can go to fulfill their dreams, or act them out. I see a white plastic molded bench which sits three people, the middle one a bit more high and centered than the other two. Then I see three people sitting on the bench in ballet costumes. These people want to dance ballet. Then I see a fat older man who is a playwright. He is writing a play these people can dance. But he is stuck and can't figure out what to write. He is lying in a recliner chair which is laid back on its back on the floor and he is seated in the chair, also lying on the floor. He is devastated because he is so stuck and can't come up with anything creative. Maybe he never had talent in the first place. He then goes to a body of water and purchases used pills to kill himself with. I wonder what "used" pills means and reassure myself it means not used and then too old and weak, not that people swallowed them already once. He takes a bunch of the pills but doesn't die because they had lost all their potency. But he plods on, determined to figure out how to write this play. Then an idea comes to him; he could use dreams. They could do dance movements like dream scenes come to him -- energy, surprise, beauty. So he writes it and I hear the male lead dancing it. The dance area is ringed with old apartments where two or three stubborn old men have refused to move out and they insist on living there so close to the dance area that their normal living movements are distracting to the audience of the dance. So I hear the one old man asking the lead dancer as he is doing his wonderful leaps and so on, does he know a word he needs for this crossword. The dancer keeps hissing at him through his clenched teeth, "I am dancing here!" But the old man ignores that and keeps asking his question. (541 words)

I am an odd-looking computer machine, quite bulky, old-fashioned and metal. I am told to check out www.20.com. So I don't know how to do this, but push a lot of buttons, one that says "w." on it. All of a sudden, I notice that many different printers are starting to print. An old-fashioned calculator, adding machine is printing out numbers on a paper roll. Then money in the form of bills come out of a metal slide and start dumping out. I run around to the front to retrieve them before they get wet in the water or blow away in the wind. (104 words)

Boomer, the cat, and I are walking to M City over the mountains. We are walking up a forested meadow hill when I see herds of sheep and deer and other animals running from the mountain down the hill past us. I am worried they will trample us, but we stand and the go around us. Some people too. I think there must be a forest fire. I look for smoke. I see a small puff but not enough to indicate danger. I hesitate making the decision should I go on or not. I decide to go on and continue as we crest the hill, I am startled and scared when I see a huge forest fire coming right at us. We turn and run as fast as we can back down the hill to find the creeks and rivers we had seen to jump into. We find one in the nick of time and dive in. I hold Boomer and we hold our breath until we must have oxygen and then gulp up some air and back under. It is touch and go. But finally the fire passes us, leaving charred remains and smoke, a close call. Now we decide we have to get to M City some other way. I see a dirt road and choose another one. I am driving a Volkswagen bus, an old one. I have two young adult mentally retarded people with me, a woman and a man. I ask the woman to drive the VW bus a ways and park it. I walk over and see with fear that she parked it so close to the edge of a cliff. One wrong move and we'd go over the edge. I realize what she did was try to park as best she could like to a curb. One wants to be as close as you can to the curb, right? I get in and very carefully pull away from the edge. Now I drive us down the steep hill and on. I say I wonder if this is the road to M City. It doesn't seem right. I see a small town, really just a cluster of buildings ahead. We'll ask directions. I get out and see a small store, but it is a ghost town and no one around. Then a car drives up. I am glad and walk over and ask the woman getting out of the passenger side if she can tell me how to get to M City. She is holding a rifle, I suddenly notice, and there are blood spots on her hands. She looks at me startled and mean. I get scared. I ask her again and she says, "I'll tell you but first you have to come up to the house." Well, there's no way I'm going to do that. She'll kill me, thinking I'm a witness to something. I agree, though and get in the VW bus and drive away. Only the man that was with her is in my way on a bicycle in the road. I follow him for a short distance. I see some highway signs and try to read them One says F. Ridge. Hwy. 50. There is a corner building and the man stops there and so do I. I walk up to a man and shake his hand. He introduces himself as Doug, the insurance man. I ask him where those roads lead to. He says to the coast. Now I realize I am going back to E City and after all this trouble, if I want to go to M City, I must start all over again. I am frustrated. (611 words)

I am watching in a sex therapist Doctor's office. A woman comes in and is naked and semi-lies on the examining table. The Doctor without a word gets on her and makes love to her. It is hot and heavy. Then she leaves. Later she returns, a few minutes later, and they repeat the procedure. Each time she takes the position of pulling her legs up near her head. It is quite mechanical and I am amazed at the Doctor's performances on command. Now another woman comes in naked with big breasts. He lays her on the couch and plays with her breasts and it is all very exciting. I feel great sexual excitement, but no orgasm. (117 words)

I am in a kitchen and notice the piled up dishes and mess. I feel bad. I haven't cleaned up for years. Howard probably is tired of that. I try to do some dishes and find a pretty cobalt blue pitcher where the handle and the spout are on the edge seams of the square corners. It's really cute. It has the words "Howard's Place" printed on it in white ink. Now I can't get the kitchen faucets to close down no matter how I turn them. I finally ask Howard how to do it. He is in the bathroom showering and I knock on the door. He calls out how. I do it. Then I go into another kitchen; more mess. I sigh. I must have not done a thing for a long time. I feel sorry for poor Howard, living in these conditions. I feel energy to clean and start in. [BL] (153 words)

I am lying in a big double bed with maroon colored sheets and I am tired and want to sleep way into the morning. Some other person, male, is in the bed too, at the other side and they want to get up. I resist getting up. Then I am having throat spasms and the hospital crew don't know how to help me and I can't talk to them to tell them to give me cortisone. I am angry at them.

I am upset with myself because for years I'd been taking a few classes here and there and often not finishing them or doing the work. I have a long string of incompletes on my transcript. I am wishing now that I had chosen a 2-year master's program and just focused on that and done it. I'd have something by now if I'd done that. Some how this has to do with moving to a new city to turn over a new leaf, many years ago. The feeling is that in some other dream I had moved to a city to start school. Now in this dream I'm at the other end. So I try to do some homework and now I go to the school office to pay my tuition and fill out papers. The secretary is busy and I watch a mentally retarded girl lean over the counter, laying on it in my way, so I walk to the right and catch a secretary's attention. She asks for $56. I hand her a sealed envelope with my tuition in it. I thought it was to be $53. She opens it and pulls out a piece of paper where I had drawn pictures. I look at it and am surprised to see many different pictures of my cat in different poses and postures. I thought I'd only done one. I point out the empty spot where the mentally retarded girl had blocked my way. The secretary says, "That's a cold spot." I say yes, because that's the feeling I got from it. [BL] (263 words)

I am in a M City school building. I am looking for the bathroom. I find it and go in. I see there are no handicapped stalls. I either stand up and pee into a basket, or I walk into the toilet area and use a stall. I choose to walk in. It doesn't hurt, and I am surprised. I walk from one stall to another looking for the right one. Some are filled already with people, some aren't flushed and some are too low to the ground. I find one I think will work and go in. I pee, and as I get up, I see blood, even under the toilet, like it had poured out or leaked out. I am a bit concerned, but not too much. I notice I feel a cramp in my belly, like when I'm having periods. I decide I must have started having periods again, after so many years. A man comes up and a nurse and they want to check me over. They walk me to the blood lab area to do some tests. Either it's a period or I am sick sand hemorrhaging. (192 words)

I am at some big college-like school. Some of the women students have stolen a recently dead man's corpse and are playing with it, doing some silly witch-like rituals over it for fun. I and a woman friend are shocked to see this (in the gym). After they are done, the audience is leaving and so are we. I say to my friend, "Come on, let's follow and see if we can retrieve the corpse and take it back where it belongs." My friend is in agreement and is surprised I cared enough to do this. We figured the element of surprise will be with us, because we are so quick to go to where I am sure they are going to leave it, namely in the sorority lunch room activity center area. I search and search, in drawers, opening doors, etc. and finally find a box which it might be in. I pick it up and sneak off to find the male professor that it goes to. I go down the halls hoping to remember his name. I find a college of his and ask to talk to him. I begin to wonder just who I can trust here. [BL] (200 words)

The first moment I laid eyes on this white, large, two-story house, I loved it. The woman who owns it says she'll sell it to me and I can move in right now and we'll do the papers later. I and my daughters start to move in. Each can have their own bedroom, the outside lawn is spacious and pretty, the rooms large and comfortable. I begin to be concerned because I haven't even asked how much for the house and if I will qualify for a bank loan for that amount. I am tired of living in my cramped little house, but it was the best I could afford. This will be much more. I see the short, almost midget-sized woman who owns it and go to her. I say, "I want to talk about the details before I get all moved in and then have to leave." She is busy driving a tractor towing a cart and I follow her, talking all the while. She smiles and wants to know what that other woman said about her. I say, "Nothing much." I didn't really listen. She says, "Good. Don't worry. We'll make a deal." She wants me to have the house.

I am on the sidewalk in a crowd. A parade of some kind is about to happen. As I start to work my way through the crowd to get to the curb edge to see better, an Eastern Indian man in a white diaper-like thing dashes past me and shoves his way past me. I notice with some negative shuttering that he only has one leg. He bounces on a table and then takes off. Later, some people are accusing me of something and need to know where I was. I describe in detail where I stood, the man and what he looked like. My witness is Lucy, a blind woman, who had smelled him and that was good enough. They believed us. (123 words)

I am at some work-related meeting and have discovered that some organization needs to be done. It had been done in the past and now it hasn't been done for a while. I decide to go ahead and do it right then and there and work up some name and address sheets and a newsletter and so on so things can get going again. It was pretty easy to do. Now I go home (not familiar). Bonnie is there and Angel is outside. I am organizing piles of things: candies, utensils, toothpicks, that were in purses. I go out to see how Angel is doing and see an island where a friend lives. There is wilderness all around the island, except for the part facing my house. I start to try and figure out how to get over there. I am stopped by a group of men who are now sitting around a circle, squatted, only they are suited gangster types. I whisper to Bonnie, "I'll bet they are gangsters." She says she'll bet a Real Lean Dollar and 5 cents that they aren't. One comes up to me and asks if I am one of the Simply Four, a gangster group. I laugh and say no, but somehow this proves they are of that group. I say I am B. They have heard of me. I am now on the island and notice it is very tiny, a sand spit really, with the tamest creek going around it and a stone walk to the almost park-like "wilderness " in the back. I am a bit disappointed. (267 words)

I am sleeping on an uncomfortable hide-a-bed in a room where the floor is dirt and a rectangular shallow hole with straw in it is the area for the bed/couch. I wake up and see Howard standing near the bed on the right. He is very sad and I realize he has had enough and will ask for a divorce from me. I feel sad and a bit bad about my treatment of him. I look down on the floor and see about 6 inches of water there, and floating in it is my hand-held tape recorder and a couple of other small electronic items. I am very upset as I pick it up and see it is warped and broken. I blame Ellie or her children. I get out of bed and feel terrible. The place is a mess. The babies are fussy. Now I and a woman friend decide to drive to town. As we are driving through a building, a man screams for help. The floor of a business has given out under him. The older pudgy owner of the business rushes over to pull him out. Now our way out of the building is blocked. I am concerned. What shall we do? The woman points to a bank with an elevator. We are, I see, on the 20th floor. I go back to the owner and call him out. He is quite agitated and confused and I apologize for disturbing him, but does he know another way out? He describes the building next door and this or that office and to turn there. I ask my friend if she knows that way. Then I am concerned how if I leave the van, will I be able to get home? It's too far to walk. Somehow I get home and another woman roommate is around. There is some information about a model who types, or a type model, and I am curious and would like to go find her and meet her. My roommate is also interested. (340 words)

I am in a large gym. A band is playing. I see Hojo on the drums. I admire the large biceps of his arms. I didn't know he played drums. Maybe I'll rethink how I feel about him. I've always wanted to be in relationship with a drummer. Now a play is going on and Hojo is in that too. I am way off in a corner of the gym, even away from the audience area, all alone. I am trying to be quiet and inconspicuous, but the players come over to my corner and a woman in a bride's dress is acting and I join in to help her. Now I'm off to the side and the play is over. Hojo comes over and I stand and then sit as we talk. Some man is talking about playwriting and I can't help myself. I chime in and say, "Well, I write plays and I find that when you write for someone else it isn't your best work. It doesn't come from the heart and soul." Then Hojo says, "I didn't know I was taller than you. Stand up again." I don't, because it would hurt. (196 words)

I take the package from Mr. Clinton and walk over to the group and hand it to someone. This goes on for awhile. Now it's over and I am going to go teach a class at elementary school. I walk through one classroom where they have no furniture; they sit on the floor. I see a man and say to a friend that I am interested in having a relationship with him. I go on. She tells him what I said. He thinks it over and then follows me into my classroom. He, I realize now, is slightly retarded or slow. I wonder about my choice. I am resetting the heater. I put in a new part and start it up. He says to me, "Did you hygenate it first?" It needs hygenation. Or it will blow up."

I am in some kind of hospital or nursing home. A woman dies during the night. Some of us feel sorry for her because she died alone, no friends or family. So we bury her (in her urn) with a jar of M & M's for company. The next morning some people found out and are very upset with us, thinking we were just playing a crude prank. I am explaining to a young man why we did it. I begin to cry and he holds me in his arms soothingly. I say, "This will be hard for you to understand because you are young, in your early to mid-twenties, but I am 53 and much closer to the end of the conveyor belt of life than you are and death scares me. You hardly even think of it." He is supportive and sympathetic. (144 words)

I am exhausted. The little girl, like Charla, is finally asleep. I am sitting in a wooden chair next to her. Ellie is holding her hand, trying to help her get to sleep. I nod to Ellie sleepily. She asks me something, and I nod, but I didn't really hear what she said. She leaves. I look up and see a glass cage with a monkey that looks like a cat in it, under water, breathing quite happily and content in the water. A water bottle for animals is in there and it sucks on the straw for the liquid food. I think it's cute and am amazed it can breathe under water. However, we have to be vigilant because when it is night time and it is sleepy, we have to move it to the regular metal cage so it can breathe air, or it will drown during its sleep. That is sort of Ellie's job. Now I am asleep and Ellie is trying to wake me up. She shakes me and I struggle to wake up. I mumble something and she says in a most appreciative voice, "Thanks, Mom, for letting me have sex," meaning she had asked my permission to go off with this guy and have sex, only I felt a bit strange, because I hadn't actually heard the request. "Oh, well," I think, "what's the harm?" I nod and go back to sleep. She moves another wooden chair over to put my feet on so I can sleep more comfortably. (255 words)

A man and I are traveling together. I have a gig to do at a bar in this motel, restaurant place. We get a free room as part of the pay. We go in to see the room. It is a rundown place, ugly green colors with paint peeling and so on. I open a door and it leads into the bar area where I will be working. The tables are red troughs where plates of spaghetti are sitting, left over from other people. We walk around in a circle which takes us to the front cafe area and then back into the more fancy restaurant area and then back into the motel part. I open another door to find the bedroom. It is more the size of a closet, a single bed and nothing much else in it. The walls are so thin that we hear another man in the bathroom. It is noisy. The man and I laugh. We go into another room, the kitchen. There are many cabinets. I am surprised. I wonder what's in them. I see a whole row of stoves. I turn one on. It's a gas stove and two burners flame on. I try to turn it off and can't get it to completely turn off. The flames go out, but I can hear the hissing of gas. I try harder. The man helps. The knob breaks off. I say, "Oh well, I don't smell gas. It must be all right. Now we look in the cabinets. There are many packets of food things, small cereal boxes and so on. I see a huge honey bear bottle of maple syrup. Well, that's the first thing that seems nice about this place. Then a tiny man (sort of the size of a leprechaun) comes in and tells us, on the sly, that we'd have to pay a quarter for any of this food if we eat it. What a rip. I get down on bended knee and say to the tiny man, "Thank you. You are a kind and sweet person to warn us, even though you could get in trouble because you work here." Even though all the aspects of this trip are lousy, the man and I like each other and find amusement in all the adversity. After all, it's a free room. (391 words)

Turtles come up on shore, by the motel I am staying at. I don't like the people that are staying here. They are secretive and are behind closed doors. I try to meet them and they slide away. I am walking around looking for someone to connect with and talk to. I see the turtles laying their eggs, that are really little transparent, snail-like things. A bunch of large beetle-like bugs come out and go to the babies and begin to latch onto them. At first I think this is a ritual where a symbiotic thing happens to help the babies. But then I realize the babies are being eaten. I feel sick. I try to walk and everywhere there are slimy, nasty bugs and things and I must step very carefully. I try to put shoes on to protect my feet so I won't feel them. I feel sad for the babies. (153 words)

Leighanne and I are talking about writing projects. She is working on one and I am popping up with ideas which she uses in her project. I look at her formula way of doing the work. She creates a large board and puts (in this case) pictures she drew of walls because she's writing a book about horse things you can put on walls. As we talk, I say to Leighanne, "We are essentially equals." But I feel hesitant like maybe she's better than me. She kind of smiles. (89 words)

I am an English 101 teacher. I walk into my first class of the day, a noon class. I am walking and fairly good-looking in a knit dress. It is a medium-sized class. I start talking about how this won't be a boring grammar class. We'll do the interesting and beautiful part, literature. One young woman asks me if it's the same hours to take a science class. I explain how it takes more hours for science because it's a lab class. Now the class is over and I need to find a bathroom and go pee before my 1:00 class, only it is 1:00 already. I hurriedly walk down the block, passing up the school building because it may take more time to find the bathroom. I see a man from my class and he says he's going to find a bathroom and goes into an agency. I follow him in and ask for the ladies room. The clerk (male) is a bit upset. This isn't a public bathroom, but I point out my need and he agrees. I open the door to find a meeting going on. I change my mind and walk back down the hall. I see another of my students in a room. This agency works with brain damaged people. I decide I'm too late for my class and must just hold it in and hope for the best. I go to my class to find it overflowing with students. A male teacher had been monitoring them for me. I apologize to them and to him explaining I had to pee and couldn't find an accessible bathroom. They are so hard to find. He leaves and I begin my intro. I say, "I am Barb Sanders." I hear different students talking all at once. I pause and wait. I hear several of them shushing each other. Some are asking me what kind of a name is B. I thank them for the attempt to self-monitor. I explain how I came to be called B. (339 words)

I am on a beach and the children are going to swim in the water. I see big slabs of rock out in the water. I decide to go swimming with them. I go in, fully clothed, including my jacket. I wade around and see a bald baby, its bonnet down on its neck. I play with him, floating him around in the water. I had told the children I wasn't going out deep, because I didn't want to get my jacket wet, but when playing with the baby, I lie down in the water and get soaked. The water is cold. (102 words)

I'm in some kind of a class and two woman sit on either side of me. One woman says rather haughtily, "We never spend time together except in class." It's kind of a dare. So I say, "OK, let's do it now." We are going for a drive. I am driving. As we approach a hill, I see an asphalt driveway and a long parked car. I begin to go up the dirt road up the hill past the car and then I stop and say, "No, we had trouble doing this the last time. Let's try the short cut." I back up to go over the asphalt pathway. I see a tiny car with odd wheels that flop around in a strange circular motion like it's swimming. It goes past. Then I hesitate and say, "We can't go this way." The woman is talking about her novel and her ex-husband and a platform. I say testily, "I'm tired of hearing about your ex-husband and the platform (sort of a novel she wrote)." She says I should use the asphalt path. I sigh and look again. I think my front wheels will lock under the lip of the entry and will be stopped. But I try again and my wheels pop over the lip and we're off. I feel a little embarrassed. (222 words)

I am making art things. My "dad" comes along and looks at it and says "Hey, that's all I get, a silly necklace around my neck and this?" He's referring to the picture I drew to represent my feelings for him. He's in blue and pink and some kind of neck band thing, holding another picture. I am hurt and say to him, "You are insulting me and my art." I walk away from him, feeling sad. I look again at the picture. I had good reason to draw it this way. I stand by my artistic decisions.

I am all dressed up in a lovely gown, waiting for my date to arrive. There are children and Melinda in the room. My young man comes to the door. I am excited and pleased. He is very good-looking and well groomed and dressed. I go to the coat closet to get a coat. I am taking special pains to dress socially acceptable as opposed to my usual bid for comfort before fashion style. I pick a coat and realize it is Melinda's. She s miles her consent at me. I put it on. A scarf goes with it, very 1950's in style. We leave, feeling happy. (107 words)

A woman with a manly hairstyle and a thick, muscular body is trying to kill my sister Lydia. The woman wants a box that Lydia has. The contents are valuable. I don't know what it is. There is a conspiracy going on between Lydia's husband and the woman and her husband to get the box and kill Lydia. I try to snatch the box and the woman is coming toward Lydia. I step in between them. The woman laughs and warns me to stay out of it or I will be killed. I say, "I can't let you hurt my sister." I have to try. We struggle. I yell out to a blind woman like Becky to break the windows and unlock the doors. She slowly walks toward the window, being very inept and saying testily she wasn't being inept. I manage to capture the woman, yelling to someone to help me hold onto her. I manage to get her handcuffed. She is a tricky, wily woman. I smash through the glass panes of the door windows and I pull her outdoors and down the country village road. I call out, "Where's the sheriff's office?" No one is helping. The sheriff, a pleasant-looking young man, saunters up and asks what I want. I am desperately holding on to this almost escaping woman and explaining the situation. I realize that while we are talking, her husband is cleaning the broken glass panes I shattered to get out of the house and they are setting me up to look like I am harming them. (262 words)

I am watching a woman being prepared for execution, because after they kill her, it's my turn to be executed. They rest her chin on a pile of white pillows. She is standing.

First there is a war going on. I wear a helmet and a bullet hits me on the top of my helmet as I am lying down in a crouched position. I pick up the spent bullet for a souvenir. I was lucky and the bullet didn't harm me. Now Jennifer H is very sad. Her girlfriend is going to commit suicide. She will drink poison and die. A woman like Katrina is there. I drink the poison too. I am afraid and yet calm. My death is certain now. It's a weird thought that my life is ending NOW. I lie down. I notice Jennifer sitting on the floor near her girlfriend. The girlfriend is in the last throes, gasping and all bound up like in a cocoon or shroud. She turns her face toward Jennifer to say something to her. Her face is contorted. She changes her mind because it's too exhausting to struggle against the enclosing death. I realize I am nearly at that stage now, my poison worked faster than hers. I suddenly think of my girls and how sad I won't be there to watch them grow up. I ask Katrina for paper and pen to write my last wishes. I think of my girls, then I think of my women's group friends and then I look at some of my writing (on yellow legal pad paper) and say, "Well, some of this was pretty good." It seems so strange that I am about to be nonexistent, inconceivable. (253 words)

I am at some kind of convention. I seem to be always late for breakfast. I hear a speech and then go in to the food area to see if there's any leftovers. I find biscuits and so on and begin to snack. I see a woman and sit beside her. I realize it is Princess Di. She speaks in a very soft voice and the radio is playing very loudly. I say, "Just a minute. I have to turn the radio off. I can't hear you." I see two or three radios. I try to turn them off. Which one is it? Another woman is trying to help me. It doesn't work. Now I am in another room. Kids' books are laid out for us to peruse. A man is talking about gun control and how toys and games are inspected for safety features more than guns are. It's a lecture. It's a loud radio newscaster kind of voice. I decide spontaneously to walk for awhile. I start walking up a road, up a hill, and notice I am barefooted. A small girl, maybe 8 or 9 years old, walks with me. I wonder if we can make it barefooted. The gravel spots could be painful. Then I remember I didn't bother to tell anyone where I or the girl was going. They may be worried. Now I'm in a room and a male is telling a sports story about the Raiders. (243 words)

I am seated and a man in a blue patterned flannel shirt comes over and sits next to me. He is sweet and loving and attracted to me. He is gentle. I am attracted to him as well, even though I critically notice that he is slightly pudgy and my age, but still a nice looking man. We sit very close. He puts his arm around me and we are physically very aware of each other. It is very sensual. We like being close together. (85 words)

I have returned to the community college C. department to work a bit. Jerome comes over and asks me if I would be a "P." I say, "I've been gone so long I don't have any idea how things work now. What does a 'P' do? Do they still do registration and center coverage? And office hours?" He says yes. I want to be conciliatory and obliging, so I agree to be a "P." I notice Jerome's eyes look odd, sort of big with wrinkles around them. He is standing at my desk and I go near his desk. He says to me, "Are you intending to use my desk or yours?" I again am aware of wanting to be obliging and say, "Oh, my desk, of course. It would be silly to change desks since yours is already set up." Then I feel uneasy, wondering if this is a part-time job or a full-time one. I hope it is only part-time. (162 words)

I am in a hospital as a patient. I think I am having surgery. A man friend of mine, like Paul of acting class, also has surgery. I suddenly remember it's been days since he went for surgery and I had forgotten to check in on how he did. I start going through the halls of the hospital asking different nurses where I can find out how he's doing and what room he's in now. They are not helpful. I keep trying. I now have to pee and go to a bathroom. I see a woman is in there, so I am by the door waiting. The woman comes out, but another one pops in ahead of me. I am annoyed and say, "Hey. It was my turn. I was waiting here." I see several other women now trying to get ahead of me. One woman left her things on the toilet, a cosmetic bag and so on. Now I am out of my wheelchair and standing so I can muscle my way in if I have to. (178 words)

I am moving from a many-roomed house. There are back rooms I've not even been in. The moving is becoming more and more disorganized. Now people are picking up things and taking them outside, not even in boxes, and sitting them out there. I don't even have the truck thing set up to take things to the new place. I ask someone, maybe my father, to wait and let's get things organized before it starts raining and ruining everything. Now I am supposed to move to the water world of my lover. I put on the bride dress and then Dovre, my daughter, helps me wrap up good so I'll stay warm and dry in the transition, with many layers of black, warm cloth wrapped around my legs and so on, a stocking hat on my head. I come out and my lover sees me, the king of the water world. He is a bit upset to see me so plain and ugly dressed. He discreetly leaves into a building to wait as Dovre helps me unwrap. I am aware that I am supposedly underwater, yet there are bright-colored flowers on the hillside and I can breathe just fine. I get unwrapped down to the bride dress and I call out to my lover that he can come out and greet me. (222 words)

I am trying to walk up some stairs that aren't even finished being built yet. I realize how futile and hard this is, so I go back down and find an "elevator" which is simply a pull chain as I stand on a wooden floor. The mechanism goes down and I see the inner structure of the basement floors go by as I stand there unprotected. I am a bit nervous, wondering if it has a stopping mechanism or if I'll just plow into the floor when I get there. It does have a stopping mechanism and I step off and find myself in a basement, a BIG basement. I am tired and lie down on the floor, with my head resting on a sack of some kind. I see a kitten and then another and then groups of them curled up on shelves and sacks of things. They are all adorable and most are calico. One of them, a half-grown one, sits on my chest and wants to be petted. I pet her, happily. One small baby one nibbles on my ear and I tell it to stop. Now four or five men come in and stop and see me. They are young and muscular and good-looking. One is in a power wheelchair. He smiles at me. They are here to pleasure me sexually. I lie passively where I am and then feel one of them near me. I turn my head and am happy to see he is very beautiful, Mexican, I think, because of his thick black hair and his warm brown eyes. I exclaim, pleased, "You are so very good-looking." He smiles, pleased. His skin is covered with a shiny coconut oil substance. I curl up to him and begin sensually kissing him all over his chest and so on. He begins to expertly wriggle his penis into me. It is very erotic and exciting. (319 words)

I am sitting somewhere with a young, good-looking man. I love him deeply and I feel he loves me too. But he is a homeless vagabond and resists the idea of surrender to love. At first he is kissing me and I am resisting. He says, "When did you ever water-ski?" and I say, "Before the arthritis, about 19 years old." He is surprised and very happy. Then I have a chance, he says. By this he means that he still has a chance not only to kindle my love, but to bring me the best ecstasy and sexual pleasure I've ever experienced, because I was so young and inexperienced when I came down with arthritis. Now he and I and a younger boy are walking through a park. I see a grassy area with cement picnic tables and an indoors area with lots of round tables. I decide to sit in the room. I go from table to table, which at first look empty, but as I get there, I'll see a sweater and purse or books. Someone is saving the table. So we go outside. I am standing very close to him. It is exquisite torture for the both of us. I turn my face and kiss him on the cheek. He pulls back sharply, like any little thing will make him cave in emotionally and he'll succumb to the loving feelings. Finally, I get up and say, "Look, I've done all I can. If you want me, you'll come and find me," and I walk away from him, ready to give him up entirely. I have to for my own peace of mind. (276 words)

I have some author's original manuscript, written by hand. It is a bulky, loose-paged thing in a folder. I try to get into it, but it is so boring. Finally, I start passing up chunks of the book. I tell Ginny that I have to scan the thing just to find out how it ends, once I've started a book. She laughs gently at me. I decide, what the heck, and go straight to the last two pages. I pick up the manuscript and carry it into the next room where Ernie is seated at a table, desk-like thing, which has rainbow colors on it, and there isn't another thing in the room or on the desk. I put it next to him and joke, "Maybe you want to read it." I go into another room where Ginny brings me a two-book set from a bookstore that she thought I'd be interested in, a sci-fi book, maybe Ursula Le Guin. I open it up and the words sparkle and sort of look like those colorful hologram pictures. They are energetic, colorful, moving pictures only on the words that have that kind of meaning. I like the books and wonder how much they cost. I try to read the cardboard display. Maybe they are $10.20 each. (215 words)

I am at the community college again, wondering if they have part-time jobs for counselors. Andrea says maybe in a few years. I am now walking with Jim (dean of something). He likes me and I am distracted a bit. He is showing me some cute things for sale in the community college store. He tries to interest me in looking at things. I realize this is his way of helping us be closer, so I try. He shows me a small ceramic footprint which, when you open it up, is filled with sand. I see a candlestick, black and slim with ceramic cats on it. It is very cute. I am trying to see the prices. Some of the more ornate ones are two or three hundred dollars. The slim one is maybe $10.00. He wants me to go have a salad and sandwich with him at the cafeteria. I feel kind of interested, but not supercharged. (158 words)

I am seated on a bench on a porch with a man and we are talking. There are other people strolling around, some women being catty about me. Another man sits by me on the swing. Someone is showing a video of a famous celebrity talking about E City. I say "Oh, I love E City. I describe the scene to the man by me. I tell him this is an arts fair (Saturday market). He admires what fun we seem to be having and how progressive. Then a road that leads to the ocean. I am puzzled and say, "We don't have an ocean at E City. Maybe this is someplace else." Now I am going down the road and see the waves. As I round the corner, I see it's a wide river with big boats causing the waves. I say "Oh, this is the big river, the W. In Dover." We go down by the river and I point out the newly built modern bridge. I get upset being so close to the churning water and say, "We have to go back up to the road. I get scared near deep water." I try to crawl up through a grate-covered hole. He is wanting to explore the bridge more and moves his grate so it covers my entrance hole. I say, "Help me please." He then pulls me up by the arm, concerned not to hurt me. I make it up and then say "OK, now we can explore the bridge." (254 words)

I am a pregnant woman. I am in labor, only it's too soon and will take a long time. One man is supposed to come to the woods where I am alone, or at least I think I am alone, but the dream insists on adding lots of other people, and I wave my hands at them to make them go away, but they don't. I am annoyed. I want to be isolated and this one man is connected with me. But the dream simply has lots of people hanging out in the same woods. (95 words)

I am in a writing class. It is the end of the term and I am packing my stuff away, but wondering if I should keep some of my things there for next term; only will we use the same room? But it's a lot of stuff to carry away. I decide to take it and I go to my new home, which is an isolated spot far from anyone. I have a door and a room, but somehow no walls on the back side of the room. Or if there is a wall, it is miles away with black emptiness there. There is one more room and I look in it, but it belongs to someone else. I look out a window and the barren fields go forever. I move in the two or three jukebox-like machines with neon tube lights all over them. A man I like comes to the door and I invite him in. I show him the place and we look out the window and see a another large window out there with my different arrowheads and artifacts lined up in a row. I point to one and say, "It's the turtle man design," The man I like finds them all strange and kind of laughs at me, but then there are three other men there, bad men. One is a 400-pound Sumo wrestler type and one is the boss, named Larry. Larry tells the wrestler to get me. I fight him off, punching and trying to kick his balls, but I don't try hard enough and he's going to kill me, so I tell him or maybe I told the man I like earlier that I had karate to protect me. I move into an all-out kill-or-be-killed mode and nail him good. I am furious with Larry and tell him I will never write for him again. He had put me in jeopardy. He laughs and then leans up against the window, and at that moment the nuclear whatever that was out there explodes and he is crisped. I remember the startled look on his face as he realized he was about to die. I run to the door jamb and stand there, and supposedly this protects me enough that they all die, but I live. But I don't completely believe it even in the dream because with that massive a nuclear explosion so close, I couldn't survive. (404 words)

There is a fair setting up across the street from my house. The Ferris wheel is set up first and will run for two days before the rest of the fair is set up. I go over and meet a man who is sort of an agent or associate of the man who runs the Ferris wheel. He and I talk and it is clear that I write and he does, and he is interested in maybe marketing stuff. I get on the Ferris wheel with Boomer the cat in my arms. We start going up and the cat gets scared and I wonder if this was such a good idea. I notice I'm not scared by the height, which I usually am. Then I turn my body more so I face full front and we keep going up and I get scared too. I hang on to Boomer hard, hoping he won't scratch me badly, and soothe him. We go around and around and then it stops and I get off. The man who runs it is interested in me and the agent comes over to tell me the other man would like to have a date with me after the fair closes. I say, "But how old is he?" The agent says, "30 or so." I say, "Well, does he know I am much older? I'm 53." He smiles and says he knows but it's OK. He lives with his mother, and besides, he likes that I am a writer. We can talk about writing. I hesitate and then say OK. I walk home now to wait, but am very aware of how tired I feel and how I would rather go to bed and sleep than wait up to go out late at night. Now I see a woman who is the mother of a young woman. I say hi and we talk. She is interested in writing too. I tell her she reminds me of a vegetable. She has a green cast to her pudgy face. This does not sit well with her. She is insulted and tells me she doesn't appreciate being compared to a vegetable. I try to explain myself saying it was a compliment and I didn't mean any particular vegetable. I didn't mean a tomato or a potato (I have trouble deciding which pronunciation I should use, like that song "You say tomato, I say tomato"). I list carrot as well, saying I think the carrot is a fine vegetable. But I know inside I am not complimenting her. Her writing is stodgy, no energy, unthinking, like a vegetable. Now I hear a very annoying sound and look over to see her younger daughter flicking her finger tips and nails together over some food thing. The mother is nagging her to stop and doing the same thing. The young woman who is my friend sits between them, quite distressed and powerless at stopping these two from their power plays. I feel sorry for the young woman and want to help. (508 words)

I am standing, holding a sick boy in my arms. He is a cute tow head boy about 6 years old. He is so sleepy that he curls up in a fetal ball position over my arm as I try and hold him around the waist. Then I pull him gently to standing and he is still sleeping, all draped over my arms. Now I feel some wet and gooey substance on my foot and think he's thrown up on me. But when I look, it is some food he had in his hand, like noodles or something, that fell out of his relaxed hand. I think he's sick and maybe has an ear infection. I carry him to a bed and put him down, covering him up with a sleeping bag. He seems quite willing to lay there and sleep. It's good for him and he knows it. Now there is a windstorm and I am in a rowboat or walking across a raised bar across a large body of water. I cross it to the other side to investigate it. The boy is there and people keep shooing him back for his own safety and yet he must go there for his better health. They don't understand that. So we cross back over the bar and some man is saying the winds are increasing. I wonder if the car we are in will be swept off the bar and into the churning water, but that doesn't happen. We get to the other side. (255 words)

I am setting the table which has an under box with dirt in it and a metal top like an old kitchen table I used to have. I have planted seeds in the dirt and I notice the plants are beginning to grow -- beans, corn, and so on. I am very impressed because I realize the plants had to have bored a hole through the metal to be there. I peek under and see that is so. Then the plants aren't plants but little boxes with labels on them to say what herbs or lotions are in them. They grow in groups of two or threes. I set a table setting on one edge and a glass of milk with a straw in it. This will be my place. Some people are helping me move stuff into the area. They hang clothes on a wire or string over the couch by the table, but the dresses are too long so I tell them to hang those across the table edge where my place setting is, knowing that will cover over my place. Now the dresses are dream images being hung up like pictures on paper. A row of people are at each edge of the table, like a square circle. It's a dream group and they are asking me about my dream images. I start to enthusiastically tell them of the fascinating dream where these dog and wolf images were in, but one interrupts me with a story about a dream of mine he remembers with those images in it, only the picture he shows me is the animals on the side of the road, injured or dead. I try to tell him that's the wrong dream, but he won't listen. Then there's another question, and I answer saying proudly that I hope someday to create a dream center here, and they interrupt me talking and talking. No one is listening to me at all. I feel frustrated. (329 words)

I am talking to a man who owns a turquoise '55 Chevy that drives like a boat. It's a convertible and when you are in the driver's side, it has a rectangular piece with a forward and a backward gear lever. I start to drive it and catch on very quickly how to drive it. I go fast and laugh, thinking maybe the man is worried I might not be able to handle it. It is fun. Now I am inside some man's house. The car man is with me. I like him, but he isn't paying any attention to me. I hear a lot of noise and go to the back of the house. I see a stable outside and peek in. Three nuns are screaming and crying and very concerned. One of them yells one of them is having one. This means one of several different animals is giving birth now. I go back into the house, the man with me, and it's a party and I want him to dance with me and kiss me. But suddenly a huge elephant rampages through and we have to move quickly to get out of the way. We jump to the wall and squeeze between the wall and the refrigerator. We are face to face and I turn my face up, hoping he will finally kiss me. He starts getting the idea and tentatively and shyly starts to kiss me. I am very happy. Now the nuns are screaming it's the other animal giving birth. We go to the door and look. I wonder if the nun's are OK there or if we need to rescue them. (277 words)

I am firing Angel. I am on a campus, like the community college. I see some women teachers I know and stop to chat. Dovre is there. She tells me she and Paulina had invested in some children's gold, children's jewelry that is made of gold. She says they lost money. It was at 6 and now it's at 3. I say, "Don't worry. Keep it; it will raise back up in value." She keeps it in a safety deposit box in a back room. Now she and I are walking and see a booth with Archie running it. He is demonstrating Contact Improv in a small, square pool of water. He smiles at me and at Dovre. I introduce her as my daughter. He invites her to join him and he'll teach her. I laugh and say, "She won't do it." I think she will be shy and say no. She dives right in and swims underwater like a dolphin. I am surprised, pleasantly so, and say, "Ok, I love being wrong." Now Mr. Spock is there. He is wearing weird glasses that don't have a nose bridge and is two long rectangular cardboard flaps with designs on them. He and Archie are friends and Spock is excited about a class he's going to teach. He's been researching and preparing for some time. He says to Archie, "I haven't felt this good since 10 years after the wake," meaning someone he loved died and he has been miserable since. I am attracted to him and would like to have a relationship. He says, "Maybe you could help me teach the class, take a few sessions." I say, "I'd like that. I can do communication skills and my disability stuff." He says, "Then we could later co-teach it." I liked that a lot. I remember I could teach about dreams. (310 words)

I am in bed with Howard. He is lying on my left arm, which is under him. He is holding my left hand cupped in his hands very gently. He is talking to himself softly. He is looking at the many, many rows of scars from shots and blood tests. He is sorry for the pain I must endure. I feel his soft skin and like being near him. I wonder if we could forget all the pain of the past and just start over. I feel tenderness for him. He moves and the moment is over. I do not try to bring it back. (105 words)

Howard and I are moving furniture in a tiny house of mine. We are trying to make it safer and better for the babies, a baby girl and a 2-year-old boy. We put the baby girl's bedroom near us. I feel happy that Howard is there and we are working on the house. It feels right. Later a Ricardo type boy (man) is playing ice hockey. He makes some very extraordinary moves that are complicated. I am impressed. Now there is a tiny, little, furry kitten-like animal with black and white spots that was just born a few minutes ago. I wonder if I'm the mother and Howard is the father, but I realize it is an orphan. We adopt it. (121 words)

Burt Lancaster and I are talking in a room. I am asking him about some of his movies. I ask him if a particular movie, "The Stone Commander," had a script or if they ad-libbed the thing. I think they ad-libbed. He says, "No, it had a script, in fact, it had two." I am surprised. Now I am counting rows of broccoli: 10 heads to a row and 10 rows. The woman who owns the broccoli asks what I'm doing. I say, "We need these for a movie about vegetables." She say, "Oh no, this is my favorite broccoli. It's so sweet." [BL] (103 words)

I am preparing to do a performance at a meeting. The woman boss is talking and I realize I don't have my scripts with me for the play. I start looking around the office. I make a mess with all the papers I look through. As I am frantically searching, I also notice that the audience is off in another part of the room, partitioned off. If we moved ourselves into their room, we would be seen better. I check and see that there is plenty of room beyond the office partition. I wonder why we were told to do it in the office in the first place. I am worried that I can't remember the words or the sequence of things we are supposed to do. I am unhappy, and frantic.

I am late to a lecture. The audience is seated along one edge of the long l-shaped room. Several tables are in the center of the area. I go to the center one and stand there with another woman. A man, a mayor, is giving his State of the City Address. He wears cowboy boots and a big cowboy hat. As he talks passionately about the history of E City, he walks around. Sometimes he is walking around a tiny ledge up on the wall. Another time he straightens up a photo of himself which had slipped down in its frame. He later walks on a balcony and then jumps down. Later, he walks around the l-shaped room's corner to be visible to the stretched-out, oddly-spaced audience. I change my hat and handbag. Two skinny older women in silly odd-shaped cowgirl hats pop out from the back stage area to sing a song, but they are too early. They sing one note and stop suddenly, embarrassed. I like the mayor and what he is saying. I remember some of the things he was talking about and marvel at how many years ago it was that this building or park was started. (201 words)

I am lying on a bed. I consider myself an old lady, very old, but I am only my own age (53). I am dying. The bed begins to rise up into the air. I float along, rising higher and higher as well as going forward out the door and down the street. I pass the interior of a hospital, and a baby who is dying joins me. I hold the baby and talk soothingly to it. We rise up toward heaven. I am relieved. I was wondering which way I'd end up going. (94 words)

I am walking down a sidewalk and it is raining very hard. I have a black umbrella and I am enjoying this walk, even though I am dripping wet. An older woman walks with me for a while but she gives up and turns to return to her car or someplace dry. I keep on, loving the rain. Now I am walking in a lovely Swiss Alps country. I stop on the sidewalk and look around at the incredible beauty all around me: mountains, yellow Swiss houses, autumn-colored leaves on the many trees. I am in a small village. A good-looking man is in a red car in a parking lot nearby. He watches me and is entranced by my innocent appreciation of the beauty around me. I begin to walk up a very steep hillside sidewalk and he gets out of the car and follows me. It is hard to walk up this steep walkway, but I am enjoying the vigorous challenge. At the top is a huge tree, where you will not get wet. I go under the tree. The man strikes up a conversation with me and I like talking to him, but I don't really give him my full attention because everything around me is so interesting. The leaves of this tree are so thick, they make a wall. He shows me by taking my hand and rubbing it against the leaves. I am amazed. He watches me, liking the reactions I have, but wanting me to notice him. I look out a window, which is really an open square in the leaves. This tree is huge and really creates a long house. We walk on, the tree now a series of hallways with small rooms. It is a museum-like place. I peek in one room, a tiny one with a woman in it. She is conducting an experiment with magnetics or something. I am curious and go in. She tells me to lean my front against the wall. I do and the man is very close behind me. Other people come in and we are very crowded, so the man is right up against my back, pressing me into this odd feeling magnetic wall. It feels good. We go on. He asks me to join him at the Village Fair. I now realize he is interested in me and is courting me. I don't completely trust him, but we spend the afternoon at the Fair, laughing, talking, and walking around. I am attracted to him. Now it is evening. I return to where I had come from, some house or hotel. My man and another one I knew before are talking. I gather from the conversation that it was some kind of competition. The other man had dated me, so this one wanted to try and get me from him. I am deeply hurt and run from the building. The man who likes me runs after me. I run down steep hillsides, dashing around trees and I go for miles. He is in hot pursuit. I wade in a lake to cover my tracks and then swim. I am out of breath and exhausted, but keep on. I arrive at the other end of the lake and climb up a rope ladder to a second story window of my papa's house, calling out "Papa." I feel the man now climbing the rope ladder too. I desperately cry out, "NO!" and try to shake him off. He is determined to catch me to explain how I had misinterpreted the conversation. He truly does love me. I fall into my "mother's" arms gasping, "Don't let him catch me." The man gasps out, "" We had covered miles and I had kept the lead the whole way. I'd pushed myself beyond my capabilities.

Howard and I are at a beach. A high hill across the inlet has some people on it. They are throwing toy boats or planes around. One lands in the shallow water near me. I wade in and am surprised the water is so warm. Howard and I go for a wade, only it turns out not to be the ocean but a parking lot. As we walk, I tenderly touch the white shirt he is wearing. I touch the arm as a gentle way to be connected or close. It feels very nice. Now I have to go pee. We go into a public bathroom. I am surprised we are both in the same one. He says it's ok. I go to the other side of the room, still concerned about the mixed sexes in one bathroom. I pee, but the toilet is loose and wiggles around. I notice it is a galvanized metal tub I am peeing into. I wonder who will have to clean up that mess. Charla joins us and we go on with the walk. We are in a church. Howard says he'd like to go there some day. I ask what kind of church it is, and he says "scholarship" or something academic. Now we are walking down a street and some drunk and disorderly people are driving in a dangerous way toward us. Howard had been drinking beer and he started getting belligerent back at them. I walk away, deliberately calling him Jared, which upsets him, as I knew it would. He resented being compared with his father. He leans up to me and says, "I'm not the only one who has faults." I sigh and agree. "I know," I say. "I have them too." Now we are seeing a counselor. We begin to talk, to try and work out our differences. I say, "But it isn't only that. There are so many things we'd have to change." It is too much. (329 words)

We are having a serious meeting about the wording of some document. It's like the C. Department people but it isn't. I go to sleep in the middle of it, because it is so boring. They want me to agree with what they wrote, but I don't want to comment because I feel it doesn't say anything of substance. Now the meeting breaks up and a man is teasing me. We are joking and he is surprised I am fun to be around. I show them another meeting room I had prepared. They ask if there is enough room for 20 people. I say, "The room capacity is 135, I would think there would be enough room." Now I am looking at pictures in a magazine of a M City-like region with a old "Gabby Hayes" kind of man in the picture. Now I am harmonizing with some man a song that goes like this, "Whoa. The sun comes up in the morning." The harmonizing sounds very good. They are impressed. [BL] (171 words)

I am trying to become a doctor. The test is to take a bunch of letters and spell out your life experiences. I take the letters out of a box, but they are made of a sort of oatmeal-type material and easily breaks and balls up. I am also running out of letters. I am upset. I go to the teacher doctor at the front desk and breathlessly explain my situation. I so much want to perform well so I can pass the test. He watches me with interest to see how I will handle this challenge. I see some plastic letters in a sheet. I find a blue sheet of them and a teal blue one. I now have better materials and rush to continue my work. I am now making a tiny tortilla and putting refried beans on it. I fold the tortilla and put a part of an olive on it and a scrap of lettuce. I then plop a bottle of Mexican beer by the place setting, in the manner of a person who doesn't appreciate the wife role. I feel some resentment. I then put a bottle of rose-colored wine cooler next to it, for me, and then move it to the far end of the table. I try to find a pretty china dish, but none are left and I look for any plate. Now I am done and go to the teacher doctor. He smiles at the intensity I feel and the anxiety for how I did. He says, "Call upstairs and see if they graded you yet." I search for a telephone. Then I ask for the extension number, then I can't find a quarter. Then it's the wrong phone. A bemused clerk at the drugstore I'm in comes over and shows me the pay phone. It is high up on the wall. I try to put the quarter in the right slot, as there are two. I accidentally try to put in a round glass piece. I see my mistake and put in a quarter. I finally reach them upstairs and they say, "The results are in, come on up to get them." I am near tears. I race to the stairs, at first crossing an odd board on the floor that tilts to slide you on down the hall, but I am on the wrong floor. I retrace my steps and find the circular stairway. I step on the first stair, which has an odd accordion expanding set of stairs that work a bit like an escalator, except I step up each step and it carries me to the next step. My borrowed white lab coat gets caught for a moment in the device. I pull it free. The clerk already knows I passed because I had been so thorough and conscientious. I am filled with dread and anticipation. (479 words)

I am in an audience, waiting for the reception to begin. The huge cake with chocolate and white frosting on it is at the front of the room. I am seated in the front row at the far right. I notice that the cake has far too much frosting on it and is dropping as the chocolate globs drift down the sides. I want to help, so I go and scrape off the globs of frosting and try to frost the cake again. I take huge quantities of frosting off and put it on a cardboard. Then I look again and notice that I have really made a mess of this cake. There apparently hadn't been too much and I had put chocolate where the white was and so on. I feel embarrassed and I feel badly for Andrea who made the cake. She comes in and I feel compelled to apologize and explain my actions to her. She looks at me and then at the cake and is appalled. She turns and leaves the room. Her cake is ruined and she feels angry and miserable. I feel bad I accidentally made the mess, but I am also aware of a sense of revenge or satisfaction, which I try to minimize or deny. I see my mother seated at the front of the room. Another woman, younger, comes and sits next to her, rather close. My mother shifts her position to create more distance and then to my surprise she puts her arm along the back of the chair the other woman is seated in. She is careful to keep her distance and not actually make physical contact with the woman. I also notice that there are many square parts of the cake all along the front of the room in piles. It was a pretty big cake and tastes just fine. Nobody else seemed upset that the frosting wasn't perfect. (321 words)

["I have the big gun."] I am on a beach. There is some group game going on where people run toward the ocean with guns. We had been trained by the army. Off they go and I am in my wheelchair and going as fast as I can, but in the sand, it isn't fast enough. The group arrives at the shore and fire their guns. They all run out of bullets just about when I get there. I take careful aim at the big boulders out in the surf and fire one shot from a huge pistol. I blow the boulders to smithereens. It's a large explosion. Now I go back to the sand to rest and play with Charla. We are hanging out together when some man picks up our backpack, with Charla's boots in it and walks off. I call after him. He drops it. I see the boots laying in the sand. I now want to return the gun to the army but can't find any army people around. I wander around and see a rifle in the sand. I return to where Charla is. We sit and the wind picks up until the sand storm is very powerful. I hold a pink cloth, perhaps a scarf up behind Charla to protect us. Now I notice street lights going by and see that I am now riding in the back of a pickup truck. My own truck. I figure Ellie my daughter got tired of hanging out on the beach and decided to drive us home. I try to look into the cab but the glass is difficult to see through. I see the shadows of four people. Two men and two women. Some punk teens had stolen my truck. I ask one woman to stop the truck and she laughs and says, "Hey, I'm only the girlfriend." I sneer and say "Oh, That kind of a woman huh?" I turn to the ones driving and tell them to stop the truck. They laugh. So I pull out the big gun I still had and smash open the glass threatening to shoot. They pull over and get out. Charla and I get into the truck to drive away. (367 words)

["Packing the clothes."] I am in a bedroom. Charla has made a mess not putting things away and I begin to clean up. We are visiting someone's house and maybe the next day we will be returning home. I open the three bottom drawers of a dresser and start to organize things when it occurs to me to start packing early. I find many pictures Charla and I have drawn and some pages of notes for my dictionary for the software. Under all that, I find a beautiful diamond pendent with my initial "B" on it. I remember my parents gave it to me. I decide to put it on. It looks very pretty. (111 words)

["Huge waves and violent man."] I am going to an audition or returning some clothes to an office. I am walking down the sidewalk in a city. I can't remember where the agency office is. I walk over the top of a station wagon car and it starts to move. I hop off and see that Curtis S. is driving. He is looking at me coldly and I worry he thinks I'm being a weird fan trying to get close to him. I try to explain my purpose but he drives away. So I walk on. I am going from building to building and I see huge white water waves coming up from the ocean. If I take the sidewalk I think I need to, I'll be sucked out with the waves. I go around the safe way. I find a door and a woman and I ask where the office is. She is unsure but walks up a very steep carpeted flight of stairs. She signals me to go with her. I point out I can't walk stairs and I will go around. I go around and find an office. I return the clothes and start to leave. I am walking down a flight of stairs and get to the door. I open it, by twisting the entire door and shoving it out. I see then that I would be walking in wet mud flats. This isn't good, I don't like that. So I start to go back u[p the stairs, again returning the door to it's proper closed position. Now a violent man with a knife has me. He threatens to kill me if I make noise or try to escape. I am afraid and do what he says. Now I seem to be a man and he wants to know if I am an IRS agent. Later he snarls, You're a lawyer, I can smell it. I taunt him a bit by saying which is it? IRS or lawyer? Later, he startles me and I fall grabbing onto his beard. It rips off in my hand like it is grass. I quickly put it back, trying to pat it back into place. He and I suddenly laugh because he had once said to me never touch my beard. Now it seems funny. We are almost friendly. (384 words)

["Doing the right thing."] I am in an open area with several other people. This is a kingdom and the king and a woman are there. He wants me to do something and I do not want to do it because it is wrong. So I stand up and walk away, down a stairway path and around a curve and into another kingdom. The older king there likes me and he is honorable and I am honorable. There is a young man as well. And a woman like Kira of Star Trek. We do good things for the kingdom and they want me to stay but I feel the need to return to my own kingdom, and finish up what I had started. I return and they are still dishonest and I fix things and return back to the good kingdom for a visit. I try to maintain some distance with those three but end up in a bathtub (outdoors) holding hands with the old crippled king (who is in the tub with me, manual wheelchair and all) and Kira, who sits outside the tub. The young man, who I am very attracted to tries to move his face close to mine and I gently push him back and ignore him but he persists, I am happy he does. Later, Kira and I and another woman shower for a long time together we are good friends and have much to talk about to catch up on the current events of our lives. I realize I've been talking good things about the young man and he may be there in the men's shower (we are at a swimming pool.) (274 words)

["Returning to work at Community College."] I returned to work at Community College. They have moved the Disabled Student's department upstairs on the fourth floor. I walk up the stairs, wondering if I should use the elevator. But I feel strong enough to make it. I see women working there that remember me and we talk. I am led to a room off in a corner which was used for storage. It is long and narrow but has a window and a nice oak desk with pigeon holes drawers in them. I say this will be nice when we get it fixed up. The students can use that end by the door for their support groups and connecting and I can use this desk for the paper work. I come back out and start to walk down the stairs but the stairs are steep and the steps are tilted so it is dangerous to walk on it. I am wearing high heels too. So I decide to find the elevator. I find it but can't figure out what to push. There are two metal plates with words on them. One is loose and keeps moving. I walk down the stairs after all, this time with no problem. I ask someone where my wheelchair is. I had left it on the second floor. I go where it should be and a play is going on. I sit at a small round table, Angel my assistant is there. Now I see that they are filming a soap opera there and Dylan has an acting part. And Tyler and other counselors are a part of the crowd scene. Apparently they do this every day. (275 words)

["Sexy cigarettes and anger."] I am in a room, maybe a hotel area. Dovre and I are hanging out watching TV all night. We are smoking and I really am chain smoking. I finish a pack and then pick up a pack called Lily Fields or Lilac Fields. It has a pretty flower with yellow colors on the pack. Obviously cigarettes made for women. I light one up and walk to a overstuffed chair in a corner and smoke. I pull in every drag I can. It makes me feel sexually excited and warm. I pick up the pack and read the back which explains that there are Phonemes embedded in the thing so that when I read the carefully coded words I will experience a sexually warm feeling. I like it and the cigarette is short and finishes up quickly. I keep smoking until the burning ember of the end is nearly on my lips. I then walk over to the sink to put it out. The faucet doesn't work right. I move the handle to the left and to the right but it never turns it completely off. Water is squirting up from the drain. I realize I have to turn a knob to stop the water flow and do that. The stub of the cigarette is now grass green. Now I go back to the chair and sit. A nurse comes in who apparently usually does the IV into a vein in my scalp or brain. She has a whole pack of men with her and she says she has injured herself and will leave me in the care of these men who do nursing stuff in the room across the hall. I don't like this and start to tell the man exactly where the vein is and it is tender and hurts. The man is sharp and cold. He says that part of your brain is dead. It can't hurt. I am furious and walk away saying I will call my Doctor. I will not allow you to touch me. The woman nurse shows me her welted and red swollen arm and she leaves. Now I am watching as a woman comes in very drunk. She won't take the treatment. Her brother goes in and comes out saying she won't listen to us. Only to Beverley. I begin to cry, angry and upset. Some woman asks me Will I fight for her? I feel put upon and used and tired. I cry and cry. (414 words)

["Candles that won't stay lit."] I am in a big room, maybe a hotel room. Charla is there. It is a family reunion. I look on the windowsill and see some small birthday cake sized candles. I decide it would be fun to light them. I tell Charla I like new fresh candles to burn. I light one or two and then the rest seem to start to light but fizzle out very soon. I keep relighting them. I look again at the ones on the window sill and realize they are under a wood sash and that is a dangerous place to light a fire. I blow them out. Now Corinne comes in as I am packing the candles up and cleaning the place in preparation for joining the family reunion, I ask Corinne who all is coming this year. My father comes in and mentions that later they are going to the radio station to hear "Gulliver's travels" being read. I say I wouldn't mind going there with you. He is surprised and says I didn't know you got that station at your place. I say I don't. I'm not interested in the content. I just am curious about how a radio station works. Then I change my mind and think it would be boring to go there. (215 words)

["The Rabbit Man."] I am in a bank. I want to deposit some money. I pull out the papers from my bag and see that it is very complex. I have to finish a needlepoint canvas they gave me before I can do the deposit. I am rushed for time and decide to wait for another day. We leave the bank, perhaps my daughters and me. They get ahead of me and I notice a man in a rabbit white face doing some street theatre. I slow down to watch. He comes up to me and kisses me. I then walk down the sidewalk and we talk. He thinks I am just a pretty girl but as I talk, he learns I am an actress, a writer, a videographer and so on. Now I turn down another street because I saw the green back of my van turn that way. I say goodbye to him. I walk a half a block and then see I was mistaken. It was some other vehicle and I return back where I was. I meet up with the Rabbit/man again. Now we are in his house in a warm room with beautiful woods used in the walls. We are taking a warm bath as there is water on the floor. We continue talking. He has a partner that joins us in conversation. I am building a big case for them using me as a professional performer and writer in their production. (244 words)

["Can't remember my Lines."] Lucy and I are driving to a gig. We pull off at the place we think the gig is supposed to be. We walk around looking for it, occasionally asking someone where it is. No one seems to know. I try to read my written instructions but it is faded and unclear. I say it must be right over there. We drive and suddenly see the freeway stops dead in it's track with a huge drop off to nowhere. We are startled and relieved we noticed it before we drove over the edge. We turn and find a place to stop. We sit down on the sidewalk to think about it. I suddenly realize I didn't rehearse or bring my scripts and desperately try to remember the ADA skit. Lucy is a bit upset with me. I say I even forgot the Evangeline hats. That really upset her. Now she wants to give up finding the place and going home. I say Katrina will be upset, what will she do? She had asked us to do this for a staff meeting. Lucy says she'll figure out something else. I want to agree but feel bad about not trying harder. I am mad at myself for not preparing better. Now a woman comes up to Lucy and sits on the sidewalk next to her. She asks if she wants a hit. I turn my head away saying no. But Lucy says yes. The woman lights up a marijuana cigarette and shares it with Lucy. But suddenly Lucy jumps up and yells get away from me. I am startled. I think that the woman made a sexual pass at Lucy.I see the woman's oddly blue-veined breast, exposed. But Lucy says "You are Sister Mary Ellen." The woman leaves and Lucy tells me in a disjointed way that she was a media victim and this woman was a part of it and she is very upset with her. Another man comes by who was a part of that time and Lucy and he talk about it. Now we agree to return home. I pick up our red car and turn it around and place it on the fast lane of the freeway back home. I tell Lucy to hurry and get in before the oncoming traffic catches up. I drive away quickly.

["Moving bathroom."] I am walking down the halls of a school, maybe a University. I am looking for a bathroom. I see classrooms and peek in, and a library, but I know I am not a student here so I can't go in, even though it looks interesting. I find a tiny room, with the word Women written vertically on the wall. I open the door and am surprised to see it is a non flush primitive bathroom. Two smelly messy holes in the ground with lids and a small metal tub on the wall. I squat over the tub and pee. It stinks in there and the room seems to be shaking and vibrating and moving sideways. I wonder if I'm in an elevator that goes sideways. I reach for the toilet paper but it is very tough and stringy like packing tape and it is very hard to break into pieces to use. I get out of there as quickly as I can. (163 words)

["Bee Sting and smelly dog shit."] I am driving down a freeway and notice the traffic is coming at me. They are going the wrong way. I pull off on the left side of the road and get out. I walk down a steep embankment to a park area, very confused. I keep looking at the traffic and saying to myself, but it should be going the other way right? I look across the park and see the other side of the freeway and the traffic is going in the same direction as the traffic on my side. This is strange. I decide I have to go to the bathroom and walk down a path. I see many piles of dog shit and the odor is strong. It is smelly shit. Lots of bees are swarmed around it and as I step over the shit, one stings me on the leg. I call out One of them stung me. Then I see the rest are hovering over and around my leg and I can't shake them. I feel some fear. I try hard to shake them off and keep moving. I finally manage to shake them away and return back to the freeway. Now I see that some cars are going the right way but it is dangerous because there is still traffic coming from the wrong direction. (222 words)

["Directing a children's play and it all goes wrong."] I have been hired by an elementary school to direct the children's play. I sit on a high shelf on the wall, with two pillows under my buns. They keep sliding because the shelf is slightly tilted toward the floor. So I fight to keep my balance. On my left sits a young student helper who keeps getting in my way. The two young actors, a girl and a boy keep doing the first few sentences over and over waiting for my directions, but I am too busy trying not to fall off my perch and I can't seem to keep the directors notebook open to the right pages. I am searching for the purple or salmon colored pages of this particular play and can't find them. I ask for help and an assistant brings me text books and copies of the script for the actors. There is a crowd of kids on the gym floor where we are rehearsing, the other class members waiting for their turn to act. Two other kids, teens, keep getting on the stage area and I ask who they are. I am told that they are helpers. So I let them stay. They are putting props on the stage. A bicycle and something else. Finally I am very uncomfortable physically on that perch and say that's it for the day. I ask a passing teacher to give me a hand down from the perch. She is reluctant, thinking it would be too much for her to do physically. The assistant comes and I tell her to stand to my left and I will slide down, using her for balance. We do that. I get into my wheelchair with a sigh of relief at being back home where it is comfortable for me. I drive through a hall and find the supply room. I request a grade book, a lesson plan book and look over the various types of stenographer tablets available. I am tired so decide to get what I need another day. I find the exit door and leave. Now I wonder if there is a bus out here, since the school is out on Highway 99. I look back at the school and notice a small apartment room on the side. I remember that Claude and his wife used to live here and for a moment I contemplate weather to visit them or not, but I am too tired. I'll do that another day. I roll on down the side of the highway and see a bus up ahead. I go there and it is a greyhound sort of bus, not a city bus. I look at the murals of trees and bill board signs they have under a long canopy as I drive by. I keep rolling, thinking at least the chair won't get tired, if I have to go all the way back without a bus. Now I see an intersection that looks familiar but only it is different than real life. It is the intersection of H. and highway 99, which doesn't really exist. I think it is odd. There is a sort of shopping mall there and big rolling hills of asphalt. I see a city bus in the distance and start toward it. A woman says you can't get there in your wheelchair. I say oh yes I can. I turn right to an accessible tunnel I remembered was there. I get to the bus, which has a very high step that requires a sort of box elevator. I am waiting for the box to come down to pick me up. The attendant seems surly and unhelpful. So I play around with the buttons which I discover send signals to the dolphins inside that power the elevator box. They are plodding along so I switch the digital signal to a Wave code, which is more jiving and jazzy. This makes the Dolphins happy. They come quickly to pick me up. But it annoys the attendant a great deal. He grumbles and I sarcastically say Oh yes. It will be on the nightly news. Maybe the Mike Douglas news show. Does Mike Douglas still have a show I ask. Yes sir, Pabst Blue Ribbon beer proudly presents me messing with the controls. OHH my!! (716 words)

["One last Fling."] I am in a room and have left two men recently who have cheated on me. The third one, Kevin Kline, is with me and I am breaking up with him. Another man, attracted to me, is near. I am sort of showing off for his benefit. I tell Kevin goodbye and then decide to walk him outside. We walk around the corner of the building and Kevin and I begin to make love, just one last time before he goes. He leans me up against the wall and I am helping him get his penis up in me. Kevin says let's go inside and find a room. I look around and see kids playing nearby and so on but I smile and say no, let's just do it here. It's too much trouble to go find a room. But Kevin insists. So we sneak into the dormitory. We peek into rooms looking for an empty one. We have done this before, and I carry a camera so I can pretend to be on a journalistic mission. We go into one room where several empty beds are there. One higher bunk does have an older woman sleeping in it. I point her out and we try to sneak back out. She wakes up, and wants to know what we are doing. So I say We heard you knew Dustin Hoffman and wanted to do an interview. She says yes, she did know him and would give us 15 minutes. I am surprised and not happy because I made up the Dustin story thinking it would be extremely unlikely she would have known him. We sigh and I pull out a notepad and randomly write down what she says not really caring. The sexual tension seems to be fading away. She says Dustin has always talked a lot. He talked all the time.

["An Angel intercedes and lovers meet."] Steve Martin is walking down a path. He is going to the military complex. A narrator is talking about how a path is taken or not taken and life changing effects take place. I see an angel, I recognize as a comedian but his face looks like Odo's of Deep Space Nine. He flies right at the oblivious Steve Martin which deflects him from his path to a side path that goes past a small university. There is snow on the ground. As he walks up the path, a woman walks toward him and as they are passing she says to him, I am a student nurse. Can I practice on you? Do you have a sprained ankle? Next, he is lying on the ground in some sort of metal casing around his chest and she is taking tests. She says she will bring him the results tomorrow. She leaves but Steve wants to see her again, as love is developing. So he follows her and finds a huge military room where troops are resting. She is seated with one of the troops. He wants to be alone with her, so he fakes a huge voice calling out orders for a parade practice. The troops groan, as they are tired, but they get up and in groups come marching past Steve waving their huge platoon placards. Each one is a shape of a mascot animal. Nearly all of them are out and Steve is wearing an odd parachute with hoses like tenticals all around himself and he is sneaking up to kiss the woman when the woman's father comes in. He is a high ranking official and demands to know what is going on. Steve tries to hide himself in a sort of rubber raft kind of thing, covering himself with those hoses and stuff. I am now looking out from that space as the officer searches all around me. (320 words)

["Healing Clouds."] I am in a house. We are moving. I am going to live with my mother. I am in her bedroom looking for things of mine I left behind when I had moved out before. One of my daughters is helping me. I look at a rack of clothes and realize they are all my mother's and none are mine. I do find one old large purse that is mine. I look at some pictures on the wall. They are hers. I see some native American artifacts and they are hers. I say to my daughter, she has the real stuff. Mine was just trinkets. I see Aunt Naomi and say I look forward to us living together. She says I'm not living with you. I'll still be in Dover. It's too hot where you will be. She is seated in an open window and I look past her to the sky and am suddenly very impressed. Huge dark clouds contrasting with bits of bright light. A storm is brewing. I say to Naomi. Look. It is so beautiful. She does not appear interested and doesn't even turn her head to look. I watch in admiration as huge clouds form and billow out at me like a movie of rapid time frames. I say to Naomi. It's just like in the movies. Huge thunder clouds rushing and growing right down at me. Then beings come out of the clouds. One, a male being, comes right in the window and I back up, afraid. He reaches for me as I am pushed back against the bed. He touches me, over my heart. I realize he is healing me and I relax, happily, to his touch. (284 words)

["Writing again."] I go into a room. I see a writing pad and remember I want to write. At first it is tedious, but I get going and it is fun again. I realize I must write thousands of pages and just keep writing. To get to the good stuff. I am now looking for more yellow pads to write on. I go into another room and I see Nate. Another man is there also, who seems supportive of me. I roll out a very long measuring tape which is at least 4 inches wide and many feet long. I make a joke and Nate and I laugh. I am carefully rolling the tape back up which I see has many pages and notes attached to the inside of it and I don't want to wrinkle them or lose them. Nate asks me to tell him what the notes say but I tell him I can't manage rolling it up neatly and reading the notes at the same time. (167 words)

["Caveman days and I fight."] I am swimming in a huge river. On the left are high rocky cliffs. On the right is an unending expanse of water. As I swim, powerfully, I see shapes passing me underneath. One looks like a body. Others are fish. I feel afraid that something will get me from underwater. In fact, something does. A sort of reptile man monster. We fight and I kill him. Now I swim quickly toward shore. The river is changing from the broad expanse to a narrow river more shallow with rapids. I find a beach and quickly run up on land and climb up a tree with many branches. I need to sleep there at night so I try to will the branches into a more accommodating shape. I manage it. Now I notice other cavemen in the tree. I am wary, but not afraid. Now a man from modern times, an scientist doing research comes by me. He offers me a dead carcass of some animal and I build a small fire in a paper cup. I roast the meat and eat it. He talks to his colleges about me. I do not speak. They observe me. I get out of the tree the next morning and walk around. A woman scientist says to me to be careful. There are more of those reptile monsters over by the cliff and they are unreachable and dangerous. One of them comes toward me and I point to the sun and make a gesture. He doesn't understand me. I am trying to say that when the sun moves this much, then 30 minutes have passed. He finally understands. The woman is impressed that he and I are communicating in a friendly manner. They want to continue researching me but I decide I must go on and continue my journey. I dive into the water and continue my swim. Only now it is a walk down a hilly path. A male narrator is telling how I walked until I found the city and a freeway which I had never seen before. I see the city ahead of me. Perhaps New York City. It still stands after all those centuries after the nuclear war. (368 words)

["The baby elephant types."] I am in a house and I am moving, or thinking of moving. I remember I have a whole wing of rooms I never go into. When I move, I'll just scoop up all the stuff and put them in boxes. They must not be needed stuff, because I never go in there. I try to remember now many miles I am from Dover. I figure out 50 miles until the interstate, then two or three hours south to Dover. I must be in the next state to the north. I figure I am about equidistant from M. and Dover. I go outside to get the mail. I walk up the lane. I see a large mailbox. Each neighbor has one too. And at each mailbox stands a large elephant. It is the elephant's job to bend the mailbox, open it and bring the mail to it's owner. I look again and our large elephant is a tiny baby one. Very cute. I wonder if he can manage the large mailbox. The mailman drives up and puts the mail in the mailbox. I watch as the tiny elephant wraps his trunk around the box and bends the pole so the box is down by the ground. He manages quite well. The mailman says and this mailbox is 5000 pounds. I am impressed. Now my sister Lydia wants to type a letter. She calls the elephant over. She types on his little side and then he goes over to the computer keyboard and using his trunk types it into the computer. But then he refuses to let me retrieve it. Now I am back in the house and Charla is preparing to go out. I ask her what she's going to do and she shrugs her shoulders. She doesn't know yet. A boy named Doug wants to meet her at 9:15 and go on the train to the zoo or someplace fun. I make the arrangements for her. Then I see Doug sitting in the living room waiting for Charla and Charla is leaving. I ask her where she's going and she says to summer camp. I'll be back in an hour. I decide to walk to Dover and then return here so I can go to M. I begin walking down the lane and then realize what a waste of energy and time that is. I'll go to M. and do the Dover thing later at a more convenient time. I walk around to the back yard. (417 words)

["How assertive are you?"] I am in a building. I am going to teach an English Composition class. It is 8 o'clock, time to start but none of the students have arrived. Even Burt Lancaster, who usually is on time. I wait a few minutes and then decide to go upstairs to the classroom and start class. If no one shows up, I will cancel the class. But at the last minute, the students show up and I teach. Now I am traveling down a road, a very straight and narrow road looking for a small town in the mountains. I don't remember it's name, but it starts with a T. Maybe Times. I guess I find it as I am now teaching a small group in assertiveness. I am in some room. I go around the circle. I ask each person what percent of their time do they behave in an assertive way. One woman says three quarters of her time. Another says not very much. One man refuses to answer. I hems and haws and says "I don't know," I get very insistent and will not go on until he answers me. Finally he grudgingly says Not too much. Then he asks me for my answer. I think and then say, Three quarters. (211 words)

["Japanese Exchange students."] Two Japanese exchange students are with me for a weekend. We are in a house and discussing what activities we could do. One of them pulls out a handful of packaged cold cuts for sandwiches. Each package is flat, has exactly enough slices in it for a sandwich. A paper china plate is in the package to look good. One package he eats very strangely. He buries his mouth in a lump of the food and gulps it down, making lots of noise. I find that curious. Now we are in a room and the room has water in it, like a lake. We are in a boat and a Japanese man is showing me a device, a square metal black thing with buttons on it. If I learn to look through it properly I can see what is under the surface of the water. At first I simply see water as we speed over it. Sparkly silver ripples. As I learn to look correctly, I see the bottom of the room under the water is covered with electronic devices, much like the one I hold. I exclaim in surprise. My "dad" is there and we agree we'd like to spend more time together. We go to Aunt Millie's apartment so we can spend the weekend together. Charla is around somewhere. (221 words)

I can walk around and function, but I run out. I try to walk downstairs to find Rochelle, but I can barely walk. I am trapped and desperately addicted to those tablets. She gives me some more and I rush back upstairs. Rochelle pushes my hand and makes me drop the bottle they are in. I desperately try to retrieve them from the floor and cut myself on the broken glass. Rochelle looks at the wound because I say there are bits of glass in it. She probes deeply and I see the muscles under the skin. I tell her to stop. She is cruelly being too thorough. I beg for more. She has cut me off. (142 words)

It has a picture of him and me in outline form and he is blacked out. He walks away from me toward the doorway.

["Walking from California."] I am at a V. family reunion. We are in some house. People are arriving and we are greeting each other. Then they take their food dishes into another room. I see Darcy wearing a perky beret hat. We chat surface things. I see Aunt Charlotte. Some of Dale's kids. Finally, I go to join them in the other room only to discover they have already finished eating and hardly any food is left. It is all packed up to return with them and people are saying their goodbye's. I am quite amazed. I comment that usually people would come and eat for hours and talk and linger over coffee. But everyone seems briskly intent on getting this over with. I forage around looking for some food, as I am hungry. I find a few packages in a large glass cupboard, like you see in a florist's shop. Now I am walking back home, which apparently is in my state and I apparently am in California. I am walking down a long straight country road. Sagebrush all around. I am a bit worried because I am going a new route. I am headed for L/, my state. I come to a tiny town and find a road sign. It says 44 more miles to the my state border. I decide to take a bus the rest of the way, since I am confused about the route. I have to go to the bathroom and ask a woman at the bus depot coffee counter where one is. I look around and find doors, but not one that indicates it is a restroom. She points to one behind her counter but says it's for employees. I am adamant that I must go now. I use it. It is very small and I pee into a narrow metal container screwed into the wall. I get on the bus and it is very crowded. I see some empty seats ahead of me, near the middle part of the bus and rush, like all the others are to grab one. The seats are facing long ways toward the windows. (354 words)

["Where's my meds?"] I am at work. My office is a couch in a hallway. I suddenly realize that the woman who assists me hasn't been to work for days. And therefore, I haven't been taking my daily medicine that I am supposed to take. A woman from down the hall comes over and I ask her what happened to my assistant. She says she doesn't know. It is lunch time and she invites me to go have lunch with her. We walk down the block to a small conference room. It is open to the public. I sit at the conference table and several other women come in and join us. One of the women is my assistant. I am surprised to see her and she says she will be back into work tomorrow. She takes me into another room and hands me two bottles of my liquid medicine. I drink down a small cup of the red medicine. I wonder if it was harmful not taking my medicine those last few days.

I have a Ford and I need to do some errands. I walk to the barn it is in and notice my left knee hurts very badly. I am limping and crying. Howard seems unconcerned about my pain and does not offer to help me drive. I get into the driver's seat and notice that the ford van is now just a metal frame with a steering wheel and a seat. I try to drive forward with great painful effort but am blocked by piles of boxes. I back up, trying to avoid the children's toys scattered on the floor. I turn left to drive down a steep wooden ramp. I narrowly miss more children's toys and make it outside. I am crying with the pain. (155 words)

["I smash the evil magic woman."] I am a woman in a house. Another woman is trying to feed a baby girl. I pick the baby up and feed her. She has two teeth and doesn't suck on the bottle nipple but chews it. She still manages to get the milk. The other woman is surprised. Apparently the baby girl belongs to a third woman who already has three teen kids, two girls and one boy. And then she had this baby, years later. I am sort of her. She is exhausted. She goes to a narrow cot bed and tries to lie down. She remembers she needs to set the alarm. She calls the other woman in to help her plug it in, thinking she can't reach the plug in socket. She looks again and sees it is easy to reach but she is so tired she lets the other woman do it for her. Now she lies down. But the other woman comes in crying. She says the magic woman has fixed it so that the older three children no longer understand they are her children. She is devastated by this and sobbing. I get angry at this injustice. I see a naked brown man, a tribal person, being manipulated by the magic woman as well. I see his penis which is bell shaped, the tip the open area wide and oval like a cow bell. The other woman says she even put a spell on the Aztec totem. I see a wooden cupboard door open and a large Aztec clay figure floats past. Now the magic woman is trying to put a spell on me (the sleeping woman). She/I am upset at her and make the bed raise up and float at her in an attempt to smash her into a plate glass window. I hit her and the window does not break. The magic woman smirks at me. I back up and try it again. I still can't break through the glass but I am managing to roll my bed over her up and down which is flattening her into a paper doll. When I have her flat enough, I light a match and burn her up. She looks very shocked I was able to accomplish this. (375 words)

["Begging Ellie to stop."] Ellie is going from man to man in this building asking each one if he will travel with her so she can go to this place she wants to go. She is sexy and flirty trying to get what she wants. I am very upset and follow her around. I had tried to stop her and convince her she was putting herself in danger. She would not listen. I am very sad. She is turned down by this one young man (I think they are all military men) many times. I beg her to stop. She is making a fool of herself. She is determined and ignores me. She goes to another man and this time he says yes. He obviously sees this as an opportunity for some free sex, just as I had worried they would. I walk up to them. I say, passionately, I will be blunt. My daughter is young. I have warned her about getting pregnant and getting sexual diseases, but she won't listen to me. Please don't get her pregnant. I cry. He looks at me sympathetically and promises he will not harm her. I turn and walk down the ramp to the outside. I walk down a path as I cry. (207 words)

["Howard Again."] Howard and I are traveling on foot. Perhaps someone is chasing us. But we stop at a beautiful waterfall and pond. We swim and it is lovely and fun, except there are alligators in the water. We get out and Howard combs my hair for me and puts it up in ornate braids that have purple cloth covers on them. We companionably walk down the road. We are in the mountains and are looking for a trail or dirt road that will take us back down to the valley to my home. We see a large double trailer truck pass by and decide to follow its route. We find a way down the mountain but we get separated in a town. I don't know what the name of the town is, so I'm not sure where I am in relation to home. A parade is happening. It is on a large long train that passes through the center of town. I can't cross the street to continue my journey until the train finishes and that will be hours. I ask someone the name of the town. I think I am in Connecticut. A car is uncoupled in the train for a few moments and I take advantage of this luck and run across the street. I continue my journey and find home. Now it is the next morning and I get up. I walk out to the living room and am excited about it being Charla's birthday. I want to make a special breakfast for her. She comes up to the house, which has the front wall gone. It just opens out to the lovely countryside. I see Howard outside playing cheerfully with the kids. Ellie is there with Charla. I say to Charla that I am going to make her a breakfast and she is crabby and rude and says she doesn't care and doesn't want it. Ellie defends her right to choose. I am hurt and go into the kitchen, slamming the door and then crying as I set the table and make the breakfast anyway. I come back out after I have calmed down and Howard is there. I look at him. He is in his early 20's, a young, lean good looking man. I rearrange my hair and notice the ornate multiple layering of the braids. I am impressed with his tender skill and thoroughness. He wants me to sit in his lap and cuddle. I wonder why we haven't had sex and then remember I can't bear to have sex with him. I am reconsidering this as he seems so sweet and tender now. I wonder if we could be happy together if we tried again. I sit in his lap. We hug. (458 words)

["A Physics Award."] I travel to a college sitting in a tiny cubicle that is an outhouse, along with a bunch of other tiny outhouses on a trailer. It stinks bad. While at college, I meet some distant relatives, apparently three children of Esther she had after her other family grew up. It is now the end of term and I am trying to remember my M. phone number to give to my new cousin. I remember 475-2266, which doesn't seem right. Then I remember 475-2907. He writes it into a directory. Now we, a crowd of people are getting ready to travel home. I see the outhouses and start to walk over to them. But I change my mind and decide to follow the lead of another of my new cousins. And walk there. Now lots of people are leaving, I guess friends and family members of the students. They walk through the swimming pool. Now an awards ceremony is happening. The woman president of the college calls my cousin's name. He is in the outhouse trailer and doesn't hear. Then they call my name. I have won an award for excellence in Physics and mathematics. I am surprised but walk up toward the front to receive it, because it is my understanding they will do a presentation thing. I see my cousin and tell him. We go up front but by the time we get there, they are wandering around and the ceremony is over. I see that my cousin won his award for excellent playwrighting. He wrote a play called Act III. I tell him I am a writer too. I have had some of my work produced in Dover and in E. I then tell him I probably got good at math and physics because I was married to a physics student and had to learn the language so I could communicate with Howard. We are preparing to walk to M., when someone says Peter, the father of one of my new cousins may be visiting soon. I think that would be interesting. Maybe we'll get along and have a relationship, since he is more my age than these young students. (362 words)

["Fire and incest."] I am in a bedroom. I am supposed to make love to Willie so that I can have his baby because Willie is dead and that will ensure he continues on. I feel quilty because he is a cousin and this will be incest, but it is important to do. I wait for him. Later, I am waiting for a man, but it's not Willie. I don't know who he is, but he is older, and it isn't OK. Maybe my "dad" or an older married man. Later, I am changed into Elizabeth Taylor and I am waiting for my married lover, who is older than me. I look out the window and see him with his male buddies swimming in the river. He is a risk taker and is up to his nose in the deep water. I feel some concern for him and also admiration for his bravery. Now he and his friends are walking up a steep hillside path. At the crest of the hill, he sees a raging brush fire. He turns to escape and they run as fast as they can, but the fire jumps ahead of them and they are surrounded. Fortunately, they find a place where the fire already burned so they are safe. But the fire is eating through the wooden wall of the shelter they are in. Now the flames are men's hands as the Fire "men" come into the house. They see a fire in the fireplace and join their compatriots. They go up the chimney and try to start more fires outside.

["Where's the other kitties?"] I am in a house. I am preparing to pack a few things and go on a day outing. There are four sweet fuzzy kitties. One is white, one is yellow, calico and black. My three daughters are there, as children. I lose track of the kitties because of the preparations. Howard is there also. I pick up the white one. He looks like a fuzzy white slipper, All white fuzz except for the bottom which is a smooth leather with two plastic button eyes. I look around for the other kitties, suddenly concerned. I hadn't seen them for a few days. I ask the girls if they had seen them. They say no, they hadn't. Howard hadn't seen them, either. Now I am worried. I search for them hoping they haven't died from neglect. The phone rings. The university wants to make an appointment with Howard. I say OK, Thursday at 1:00. I hang up. Howard looks up at me and says, but I wanted to stay home with you, because I love you very much. And I wanted to be with the kids. He then realizes the little boy has wandered into another room and he goes to get him. He comes back out and the project he was working on falls apart, because he accidentally kicked it. It was a sort of pumpkin with glue on it in white drops where other melons had been attached. We never do find the other kitties. Now we are in a car going out to the country to find Howard and Jacquelyn Kennedy, in the white house. Howard has something for them. Recent floods caused the river to come out on the road and we are driving through it. Howard is driving sand I am worried it will be too deep and we will get stuck, but we successfully get through. We find a small house were we now live, only four houses down from the White House itself. Later we drive out into a field to have a picnic and I look back to see the white house which is oddly set among a series of old west type buildings. We get to the picnic and I open a huge package of hams. We put three on the grill. I wonder what we are going to do with all the other ones. I hope they don't go bad. (399 words)

["The Disembodied hand."] I am a man who is looking down into a big room full of musicians. Someone gives me a clarinet. I have never played one but I seem to know sort of where to put my fingers. Another man is on my left. As I am trying to play the clarinet, I feel a hand pushing me. It is on my back, up near the shoulder. I sort of see it from another perspective so that I can see that it is a disembodied hand, a big white one. I feel very uncomfortable about this. I blow air into the clarinet and the note is sweet and clear. I fumble more with the fingering. I see my big fingers stretching to reach all the holes. The hand is somehow trying to help me, perhaps, give me an encouraging push. Now the rehearsal is over and I go down into the big room. I find the leader and I tell him I've never played before. He is impressed with how well I do but also somewhat distant. He shows me how to screw the sections together more tightly and shows me a few fingering positions. I practice it. The feeling is I will be very good after I have learned how to do it. (213 words)

["The Mac House is all different."] I arrive at the Mac house to visit my parents who still live there. It is all changed. I walk up the front sidewalk and am amazed at the size of the tree in the front lawn. It has overgrown the lawn to the place that the whole lawn is covered with this rich canopy of leaves. I go in and am surprised to see how much the inside has been remodeled and changed. I go from room to room, exclaiming at how large the rooms are and how many more there are. I tell my father I can't find my way. I can't recognize the original rooms and where they were. I enter my parent's bedroom which has a huge dark wood bed frame. Now I am in the kitchen, where the kid's tables have a special place behind the cabinets. I see the large plate glass windows and beyond I see the ocean. I walk out on the patio on the right side of the house. Dwight sees the ocean and says I wish that that had been there when we lived there. Now Dwight introduces me to a friend of his. A nice man. He walks into the next room and sits at the piano. He plays a blues song. I like it. He also plays a sax. We get along well. I like him and he likes me. (232 words)

["Loving Paul, sad black woman."] Paul Reiser and I are a couple. We're in a small narrow kitchen, trying to fix a breakfast out of the mess on the counter. We are in love and want to do kind things for each other. A teenage boy runs in, loud and rude. Paul tells him to go on home. Get out. Paul is annoyed but still pleasant and tolerant. The boy leaves and Paul and I are feeding each other tidbits of food. The boy comes in again and we repeat the process. Some other person knocks and walks right in. Paul becomes amorous and kisses me. I like it and respond. Now Paul and I are lying together on the floor and Paul and I are sexually excited. I murmur, not here. On the floor. He says, Yes. Here. I say, but people keep coming in. He is kissing me and I give in because it all feels so good. I love him and he feels so sexy and good to touch and be touched. I grasp his hair and gently pull him closer to me. A black older woman in a wheelchair is wheeled in by her son. They see us. I am concerned she'll be shocked and get up and go to her. I look into her face and say It's all right, we're in love and enjoy each other. She looks at me sadly. She says but some people don't get that in their lives. I realize she is lonely and sad. I hug her and we have a long caring hug. Then they leave. Then I hear noises and go to a large open window which opens out to a roof ledge. A large crowd of Paul's friends are trying to sneak up on us. They are laughing and having fun. I see Paul outside, down on the ground and one of his friends is next to me. I tease him saying, Ha, Ha. You didn't surprise us! He laughs. It all feels so loving and fun. (336 words)

["Where will I live?"] I have to move from an apartment and I meet Bill. He shows me a tiny one bedroom cabin I can rent. On the day before I am to move, I go to where Bill is rehearsing a project. His assistaant. is there. I remind Bill of our agreement. He is surprised and upset. He is still using that room to write scripts and so on. I say but we had an agreement. I have no other place to go. He reluctantly agrees to let me move in although he will still be there to finish his work. Later, I show Dovre, who lives with me, a cute photo cut in the shape of a crown and a valentine of Bill at his 50th birthday party. I point out Derek, and his new girlfriend. Derek is in a laughing pose, his head thrown back and a big open smile on his face, like a photo Howard took of Dwight years ago. I point out to Dovre the plain wooden boards the cabin is made of. There are bare nails half hammered in. It is very primitive. (186 words)

["Darcy and the incest."] I am at the V. farm. I am outdoors. I see that Aunt Rosalie, Darcy and her family are camped out down in the pasture. They have been there for a while. We had been waiting for them to come to us. I realize that I will have to go to them. I walk down to the pasture. I talk with Aunt Rosalie. Darcy joins us. I realize that now is a good time to ask them about the incest. I say, in a hesitant tone of voice, I need to ask you a question. It may be distressful for you but I don't know what else to do but ask it. Then I ask Darcy is she had been incested and does she know if I had been incested. Darcy and Aunt Rosalie are pleasant enough. Darcy says Well, actually. There was no incest. I feel oddly uncomfortable about that. Then she says, It's just that my father had some lessons for me to learn. He was teaching me. I then smile, thinking aha. She is in denial. There really was incest. I feel relieved to finally have the answer. (191 words)

["Hiding in a closet."] I am walking down a road with many people. These are my French friends and they are fleeing the enemy. I am a photographer, with a tiny camera. Other people hand me their tiny cameras and ask me to take pictures of them. I look to see where the on button is and so on. I take a number of photos. Then we are rounding a corner when I look back up the road and see the enemy soldiers coming after us. I race over to my friend and yell, they're coming. They begin to panic and run. In the confusion, I run and hide in a closet. My original intent was to hide the camera so the pictures would survive to tell the story but by the time I am in the closet, I hear the massacre outside and I say hidden, to save my life. I knew I could not save them. After the Japanese soldiers leave, I go out and see all the dead bodies. Two boys apparently survived, one is disabled. I take them with me as I sadly walk back to the gas station in France which my French friend had lived and worked. I am gathering up his papers to keep for remembrance sake. I find a scrapbook where my wedding announcement is pasted in it. It is hand written in calligraphy, like my birth announcement I made for one of my girls. It says Barb Anders. Then I see the partially obscured photo of a baby, which looks like Dovre's 6 month old picture. But it is the boy. I burst into intense grieving sobs and cry deeply. I am overwhelmed with my loss of my friend. (284 words)

["Hiding again."] I am teaching a class of 5th graders or so. One uppity girl and two nearly delinquent boys. I like the boys. I work hard to help them. Then I leave. At the door, the boys hug me goodbye and one sticks his head under my shirt and is sucking on my skin just below my breasts. Now, I am walking with a girl, maybe Charla. I look ahead of us and see Yankee soldiers being chased into the woods. They are running through a shallow river. I and Charla are in a building, hiding and I make sure we are not able to be seen and I yell a warning to the soldier who used to be a student of mine. This attracts the attention of the other soldiers as I knew it would. Charla and I run up the stairs where it comes to a platform and a choice. Another flight of stairs going down and a ladder going up to a small ledge by the ceiling. I know it would be more likely I should go down the stairs which will lead to outside and I can run. But I choose to go up the ladder thinking that they will assume I went down the stairs and then I will be safe. I feel doubt about the wiseness of my decision. Nevertheless, we go up the ladder and lie down curled up and wait. The soldiers run up the stairs and others run up the other stairs. I hear them talking about whether they have seen me or not. Some look up and I think they see me, but they all go away. I go on now, alone. I had parked my van over night in some empty lot and I walk there to retrieve it. When I get there, I am upset to see that vandals have stolen things. At first, I think nothing is wrong and then slowly, I notice one thing and then another. Four flat tires, the steering wheel is gone, the front seat upholstery is gone. I see my mother's violin is there. I am relieved at that. The pretty rocks my two school boys found are gone. That saddens me. I see some things lined up under the wheel well on the rear of the van. Evidence. I begin to walk back to downtown to call the police. I feel stupid for leaving my van over night where a rock concert is held. Just asking for it. But I am glad that not any real valuables are missing. I walk and see the big city core of buildings across the huge river. I see the water is high and rapid. I walk along the edge of it, on the sidewalk, a bit worried I will fall in and be swept away. I continue on to the city, looking for Monroe street. Now I am back in the school room to tell the boys and the uppity girl about their rocks being stolen. I want them to know I am proud of them, because I can see they have made important changes She is less up tight and they are more responsible. I feel pleased. (533 words)

["My family destroyed."] I have returned from somewhere, maybe I have been at war. I am trying to connect with my family. I am walking down a long narrow hall with doors. I'd open a door and walk through, closing the door. Over and over and over. I get word from some man that my grandfather is now living with a General. He is having a homosexual affair. He is not interested in connecting with the family. Then I find out my "mother" is having an affair with some man and is gone. Then I find my little "sister," who is 13 years old and naked. I see her budding breasts. I am upset with her and try to talk her into getting clothes on. She laughs at me when I tell her that men come through this hall and some might rape her. She shouts out the word rape and laughs. I race down the hall, going back to find my grandfather. I open door after door and never find him. (169 words)

["Observing life as a couple."] I am struggling hard to walk on a steep embankment. I am concerned that I did not choose the right way to go. The soil is sandy and it keeps sliding under foot, making walking very difficult. I see that if I slip and fall, I will land in a dirty water area. That would be bad. I look up to see if it would be better to walk on the high ridge of the bank. No, that isn't good either. So I continue walking. Suddenly I see that I have made it. I walk into a city area. Right in front of me is a road. On the right it is a deep canyon and on the left, it is flat and a regular street. So I turn left and walk down the street. I look at the shop doors. I am looking for something, but all I see is a mission and a post office. Now, I am transported into a domestic scene. I am seated on a couch watching a couple as they manage their daily routines. Four or five cats, half grown kittens, gray and white spotted ones, hop around me playfully. I go into the kitchen and watch the couple. I am very aware that I live my life as a single person. This is what it is like when you live as a couple. I feel envious about their happiness at being together. (239 words)

["Doing workshops."] I am visiting Ginny. I am in bed. I am sleeping next to Ernie. It is comfortable and friendly. We hold hands. The next morning, I am making changes. Ginny is helping me. I am moving some things around in my house and packing some things. Now I am giving a lecture at a workshop. There are 6 people in the audience. Two on my right, two in front of me and two on my left. I move a rectangular table with uneven sides, like a half of a hexagon, in front of them and begin my lecture. I am reading Italian from a big beautiful book. My accent isn't very good and I work hard to do a good job. (121 words)

["Visiting Hector."] I am in Mexico City to visit Hector and his family. I fly in an airplane and feel quite comfortable. There are fewer stops this time I notice. I arrive and his sisters pick me up from the airport and take me to their house. It is late at night and I am remembering that I did go to the Doctor's office before I left to get the stomach pills to ward off The Terrible Tourista. Sickness. I am taken upstairs to the sister's bedroom where a third small cot has been set up for me. Hector isn't anywhere around and I expected this. I am happy to notice that I feel fine about this unlike the last time when I was angry. I am determined to enjoy this trip and not make the same mistakes I made the first time. (141 words)

["Hector's Mother."] I wake up the next morning and go to the kitchen where Hector's mother is cleaning up. I look out a big window and see a large river running right by the apartment. It is flooding and overflowing its banks. I am talking with his mother about how nice and spacious the kitchen is. This is obviously her pride and joy. I look down and see that the river has risen up so much that it is flooding the kitchen and I am standing thigh deep in the water. I am surprised it isn't cold and then I realize that I'd been standing in it for hours and have grown used to it. Now Hector's mother and I go for a walk up some stairs. The apartment is in the same building as this small city. I see "Jose" who sort of is an older Hector, but is sort of a younger Hector's father. We chat. Hector's brother's are there, doing business in the city. They wear nice business suits. (170 words)

["The Man Helps Pack things."] I need some help packing up some things and bringing them to my big house. A young strong man is helping me. He is very efficient and strong. I watch him as he picks up heavy things and easily loads them into the van. Now I see a tiny black kitten who had his back legs injured and is recovering. I pick him up and hold him, petting him. Now it is time to take the things to my house. We drive to my house which has a large double door entry way. The doors are open and some friends had been doing a garage sale there. I notice a rusty boiler. The man tells me he will not work for me tomorrow as he had earlier agreed to do. I realize he is flirting with me as we are attracted to each other so I simply shrug my shoulders and say OK. I walk into the house. I am now holding two tiny black kittens, one well and the other recovered from the injury and still limps. I release them in the house so they can romp around. They scamper upstairs. Charla is up there playing. The man brings in some boxes and things and puts them down. He and I look at each other and he smiles. I respond with a smile and he walks over to me and hugs me, kissing me in a sexy way. I warm up to his advances. Just then the door bell rings and I go to the door. Jock, Melinda and two more people come in to visit. I wish they would go away because I want to make love to this man. So I ask them in and tell them to hang out in the kitchen, I need to find Charla. I and the man go upstairs to find the kittens and Charla. It is a very large house with spacious rooms and we go from one to the other looking. I see Charla in her bedroom playing with toys. I see the kittens. The man and I kiss again. (350 words)

["Behind the scenes."] I am at a rehearsal but I am only an helper. It is an unusual position for me. The director is upset that the person in charge of maintenance isn't doing his job right and there is no toilet paper in the john. Also there is stuff left in the wrong places. Sparky is around somewhere. I have a notebook, maybe the scene lines, so I can help actors rehearse. I tell myself to try to stay in the background and not foist off my loud attention getting personality onto other people. (92 words)

["Fired."] I am being fired from my job at community college. I am upset about it and want to fight the decision. I talk to some woman who is surprised that I was fired. I explain I was told that the reason I was fired was that I needed a special permit card and my circumstances didn't allow me to have one. She says to me but that's not true. I have a special card. Because I am a friend of community college and a girlfriend too. This means that she has several relationships with community college and she shows me a plastic ID card community college issued to her. I walk to an office to talk to the woman in charge. She is Rosie O'Donald and is taking care of her baby as she works as an executive. She doesn't listen well as she is distracted by her baby. I help her wrap some things but that doesn't help the situation. I need to go to the bathroom. I see a small bathroom and ask permission to use it. She says it has no toilet. So I go down the hall and I hear my Aunt Naomi who is teaching children their letters and sounds. I pass that room by and find the restroom. I go in and see the toilet which is hanging on wires and swinging back and forth. I sit on it but the swinging won't stop. A girl comes in and stands near me. I am concerned I will spray urine out onto her shoes as the toilet is simply a swinging bowl that is hanging above a cement trough. Bicycles are hanging up on the wires as well. People, families, wander in and out. (289 words)

Dad is busy setting up his music festival. He has reams of paper on the subject piled up on the file cabinets. I see food on the table and dish up a full plateful of pasta and sauce.

I feel his tongue but the kiss doesn't feel good, or complete. I feel alone and isolated. Now I leave with Howard, I am a bit disappointed it is Howard again, but we leave. We go to a funeral. It is for my "dad." As I am walking down some steps to the room where my "dad" is laid out in state, I hear people exclaiming in wonderment and people crying from surprise and happiness. I realize my "dad" isn't dead after all, or came back to life. I go into the room and try to hug him. When I lean down to kiss his face, I notice that his face is covered by a plastic box like a take out sandwich would have. He looks tired but glad to be alive. (158 words)

["Archie and I dance into love."] I am in a kitchen. Archie is there too. We begin to dance in a Contact Improve way and we are sensually making romantic love while we dance. It is sweet and tender and exciting. I hop up on his waist in the front and he leans way back and we balance while twirling around. It is wonderful. An older woman comes in and she is confused about something that happened in a class or group I was teaching, probably about dreams. She is asking questions and I am trying to explain to her as best I can. Now apparently Archie and I are in love and living together. We are always together, intertwined. A small sink is next to our bed, in my room. Each morning I get up and I see globs of blue toothpaste in the sink from Archie brushing his teeth and not cleaning up after himself. I am annoyed but I also feel fine about cleaning it up for him. It is a loving gesture. A way to help him. I scrub it out, then brush my teeth. We are going back to our work, and Archie says I love the morning ritual you do. I love watching it. I giggle wondering what he meant. He says I am quick and efficient and do the same thing each morning. A man comes by. There is some problem at work that Archie and I and the man need to fix. His wife Mabel Wynia sent him a noodle and cheese casserole to feed us during the work. I feel pleased that she knows I am there and wanted to help me too. (276 words)

["Playing the violin."] I am in a quartet of violin players. We are standing in a row on a lake beach, very near the water. Across the lake is a huge cliff which has seats or bleachers in them for the audience. To my right is the orchestra being directed by a famous director, a man. I work very hard to play as perfectly as I can. I can feel my little finger brushing against the other finger like it has a hangnail or a sore. This could throw off my playing but I concentrate very hard and manage to play very beautiful music that the director is pleased with. I win the contest. (111 words)

I see the house in the distance, with lots of windows and skylights. It looks nice. But I am a bit worried about how far away I am from the center of town. It will take longer to run my errands. I am on a bus for awhile and then I am walking and Ernie is riding a horse. We are talking in a friendly way. He reaches down his hand and holds mine. He asks me if that is OK with me. I nod and we continue talking and moving slowly on. It is a friendly and supportive moment. (126 words)

["Sexy hippos."] I am in an old big house. It's a bit run down. Some man keeps coming in with small gifts. I guess he broke something and is trying to repay me with things I had said I wanted. He gives me a china tea set but as I look at it more closely, it is rather coarse thick china with chips in it. Now he's at the front door and I go there and he wants to fix my electricity problem out on the porch. I try to tell him I don't need all this, it isn't necessary. He keeps on doing it. I think he feels guilty. I see a path and call to Charla. I say let's go for a walk and go see the sea lions. She and I walk up the path which goes up a hill. It parallels the coast line so on the left is the ocean. We get to the top and look out over the edge. I see many sea lions out in the ocean. Now lots of other people are coming to see too. They bring radio station equipment and platforms for stages and so on and very soon my view is cut off. I walk around the area trying to see over or past the booths and platforms. I see a weight lifting contest being set up. I find a small place where if I get very close to the edge, I can see. I look and somehow I can see from underwater. I see two hippos. One has the others little curly tail in its mouth and is pulling it backwards toward himself. It is a female hippo who wants to make love to the male hippo. I chuckle. Then suddenly, the male hippo is up the cliff and coming at me. His huge mouth with all those teeth is right next to me and I am trying to crawl and roll away. He has me in his grip and is rolling over me. I am afraid I will be crushed and injured or killed. He seems to want to make love to me. I squirm away from him and walk back down the path, wondering how I can manage all this without my wheelchair. (376 words)

["The disabled man stands up."] I go to the office of Bob T. to get an opinion and some advise. He is in a wheelchair. He is pleasant to talk with and very supportive. Merle is around somewhere. I leave and then need to return and ask him some more questions. I go down a school hall looking for his office. I find what looks like the right place, but none of the green doors have labels on them, so I don't know which door is his office. One door opens and a person walks out on crutches. I figure this is his office and I go in. I turn and see him standing near me. No wheelchair and he is very big and tall. I am surprised. He apparently can stand and walk a bit, like I can. He smiles and sits close to me. Another woman and her friend sit close by and the four of us are in physical contact we are sitting so close together. Our knees bump and so on. I am aware of the contact with Bob. He seems attracted to me and I to him. It is friendly and pleasant. Now I am in a room with my two daughters, Paulina and Ellie. I am cleaning up my things and want them to help carry some of the dresses. Ellie is not interested in being helpful. I am a bit annoyed with her. I look out the window and I see many black whales lying down for a nap. They are above the water line, and are nose to tail thick. Hundreds of them. I then turn and decide to boat down a water way thick with sea lions. I go fast and then turn to go back. I slow down, concerned I will hit a sea lion because they are just under the surface of the water. The water has brown spots of sea weed in it. (320 words)

She has been given the order to create an unusual bit for this part of the movie. She is stretched beyond her limits and can't seem to think of a way to do that. She is trying to create a mask. I try to help her. At first, it isn't working at all. I am trying to crochet a row out of a waxy candle like material. It keeps crumbling. I then get the idea to curve the mask to the shape of a face, more pointed and narrow at the base, like the chin. I try decreasing stitches and then for the next row to increase stitches. It is still difficult but is working better. The cotton thread is coarse and very black. Somewhere in this dream, Howard is seated on a bench right by me, companionably hanging out with me. It was a friendly feeling. Now the boss wants the woman to create a whole new little scene to put in the movie. She can't come up with an idea. I have one but she isn't listening to me. I'm just an "extra." (215 words)

["Howard says No."] I am in a huge house, where I the children and Howard live. There are many rooms that I never go into. We just don't use them. We are cleaning up and packing, apparently to move or to get ready for the new business to move in and use some of the space. Howard is coming down the stairs and I am going up the stairs, each of us have a pile of clothes and things in our arms. I begin to think about us getting back together again. It seems friendly enough, maybe we could make it happen this time. We smile at each other as we work together to organize and clean this big house. Later, I say to him, I've been thinking, maybe, I mean, I know it would be impossible, but maybe we could reconcile and be together again. He smiles gently and says no. I defensively say well, I know it's no, but I was just thinking about it. I remember thinking to myself just before I said anything that I can't believe I'm saying this. I shouldn't be saying this, because then maybe it would happen. (192 words)

["Bill Cosby's Unusual penis."] I see a naked black man in profile. He is in some argument with a white man. They are standing facing each other, the black man in a more defensive position. I am curious and look down to see if I can see his penis. It is long and thick, and hangs straight down. Then as I watch, it begins to snake around and I see that the tip is like an elephant's trunk, sniffing around. I think the black man is Bill Cosby, in his younger days. (88 words)

["Out of control in the snow."] Ellie is driving the car. I am in the passenger seat. Snow is on the ground. She drives to the back of the house and says look at that hill. I look. It is a very steep driveway going down. I say be careful, back up so we don't go other the edge. I am referring to the cliff in front of us. She tries to back up but we start rolling forward and we are now headed down the steep driveway, sliding and out of control. I am tense but somehow, Ellie manages to keep control enough so that as we are racing 100 miles per hour over the landscape. It is a wild ride but somehow I know we are going to be all right. We finally come to a stop near a restaurant and we go in to have a cup of coffee or something to soothe our nerves. Paulina is with us. She was in the back seat of the car during the ride. We go in and in order to get up to the level where a table is, we have to climb up on a white toilet seat as our first step up. The water is overflowing and I gingerly try to place my foot so it doesn't get wet. Then I have a very high step to make up a sort of water slide thing. (232 words)

["Tickling Ernie's Feet."] I am seated in an overstuffed easy chair and Ernie is teasing me. He stands up on the back of the chair just above my shoulders and then sits, draping his ;egs down over my shoulders. I tickle the bottom of his bare feet. He laughs and we giggle, having fun. Later, I am walking down a hall. I see Howard in another room and he comes out toward me. I am a bit surprised because he is dead. His face is white and quite round. I smile and say I've been meaning to ask you a question. He waits. I say, Was it the National Merit scholarship or the Rhodes scholarship you got? Or both? He says both. I say well, they realized just how smart you were. But then maybe they took the Rhodes one back, because no one can have both. He is very pleased that I acknowledged how smart he was. I say good bye, realizing I was luckily to catch him and ask this question, since he is dead, but just not all the way gone yet. (182 words)

["Sheep's Feet: Eaten Alive."] I am watching as two large dogs are gnawing on a live sheep's feet. I am horrified and scream at them to stop. I try to rush at them or distract them. Nothing works. Someone else is resigned to the inevitability of this but I am sick with disgust and sympathy. I empathetically feel their pain. I see the feet are gone and the leg muscles up to the mid-calf are down to bare bone. The dogs never let up. (80 words)

["Paulina Comes To Me."] I am going to do a performance and then I will catch a plane to visit Paulina. Another woman and I are to read some of our writings to a small group of people in a room. I am frantically looking for my book I read from. I can't find it. Now it is my turn and the people, who are standing up in various parts of the room are waiting. I talk to them as I rifle through a book looking for my place. I am charming but I can't find anything. I apologize and give up. I go back stage to call someone to get things ready for the trip. I can't use the phone because the next act is a rock band that uses a computer modem hook up with their act. Time is ticking away and I can't seem to find the man who can get me to a phone. I go looking for him and find myself in a tiny boat just off shore of the island we are on. The water is very rough and choppy. I am worried. I can't imagine trying to return to the mainland over this difficult bit of water. I then look again and see the tide has gone out and the water is gone. I ask someone to pick up my boat, with me in it, and put me on shore so when the tides return, I'll be safe. Someone does that. Now I walk back into the building. Finally I realize it is too late. My plane left at 12:30. The rock band is done and I try dialing. I can't remember who I was to call. Maybe Dr. M. for permission to go, no. Maybe my mother. No. Maybe Paulina. Then I turn and see that Paulina is there. She had used my unused ticket and flew to visit me. I am happy. (317 words)

We have plenty of eggs, lettuce and carrots. Nothing else. I guess we have to go to the store and replenish our supply. Then I remember we still have canned goods and soups in the cupboards.

["Fast and wily baby."] I have three children. A girl, about 8 years old, a boy about 2 years old and a young baby. We live in a city that is all indoors. We have two places we live. We are traveling from one place to the other. The girl is argumentative and not helpful. The boy is active and having fun. The baby is always sneaking away from me and popping up in odd corners. The baby keeps changing shapes as well. At first it was a normal baby. Then it was a small rag doll. Then a toy. I am angry at the girl for not helping me watch the baby. I am frustrated with not being able to keep up with the baby. At one point, the baby in the shape of a small doll was caught in a corner behind the wall like it was in a mouse hole. I had to wriggle it free. Then it bounced off to get into other mischief. Now we decide to travel back, on foot to our other place. We meet a male neighbor and the girl is talking with him. I am concerned that she is so unconcerned about talking with strangers. I come out to supervise. We return to the first place and I do a visual check to see if anything is amiss. I see three places where I left things on. The toaster nearly burnt something near it. I comment that I could have burned the house down. (249 words)

She laughs at me contemptuously. I angrily walk back to the tasks I was doing, maybe in the kitchen. I am still crying, feeling great pain and overwhelmed by all I have to do. I go back to check Charla. She is taking a bath and I am furious. This is goofing off. I told her not to do anything. Her hair is full of shampoo and I grab her roughly by the nape of the neck and I slap her and shake her. I am aware I am out of control and doing and saying hurtful things that are wrong but I can't seem to stop. I feel guilt and am driven to continue. Charla is arrogant and doesn't stop pushing at me. I am washing her hair and as I look more closely, I see many different colors of hair. It is dyed pink, purple, blue, and other bright colors. I ask her why she did that. She shrugs her shoulders and says because she wanted to. (200 words)

["Flying, Aliens and a manual wheelchair."] I I am in a mechanics shop because my van is broken. I am waiting a long time and the owners seem to be watching me very closely, but from a distance. It makes me nervous. I pace up and down, pretending to exercise, but really trying to keep an eye on these strange people. Finally, after many hours, I am now waiting in their living room. The boys are in there too and they watch me suspiciously. I notice I am now in a manual wheelchair and I pop a wheelie, balancing on the back wheels. This impresses the boys very much. I seem to have gained some power by impressing them. I keep doing it. Now the living room furniture has been removed and the boys are setting up a game for a contest. Three large tin cans are piled one on two to form a pyramid. A long line of these clusters of cans go down the center of the room. I am now in another room where a TV screen is in the wall and is playing Star Wars. A food table is set up. These strange boys are watching me. I begin to wonder if they are aliens. I get worried and nervous. I find a moment when they are not looking and sneak out and down the stairs to the shop. I look for my van and finally find it. It is all changed and I get in. The aliens are on to me and I must hurry. I am excited and a bit scared. I try the key and am able to get it going. The faster I go, the more the van rises up in the air. I am flying. The aliens are in pursuit. I have to work hard to keep the van above the tree line. I look ahead and see a mountain range. I keep forcing the van higher and make it over the mountains successfully. I call in to a small town airport and tell them I know this is strange, but I am flying a van and don't know how to land it. They give me instructions and I made it in safely. (366 words)

["Long time wooing."] I am some jungle primitive woman, shy and careful like a deer and also a royal person, a leader of my tribe. There is a group of men who are after me, to steal me into their tribe. There is one man, not of their tribe, or my tribe, who is very attracted to me. But when he approaches me, I shy off and run, thinking he is like the others and means to entrap me. He is incredibly patient. He repeatedly waits in the clearing and very slowly approaches me. Gradually, I allow him to approach, as I am also fascinated and attracted to him as well. But the bad guys keep breaking through and use the advantage of his attracting me to try and capture me.

["Hurting Myself."] I am in a log cabin and outside is a big burly bear throwing himself against the cabin wall, trying to break in and get us. A man, maybe my brother Jake is standing near the door, a screen door, trying to shut it against the bear. Now I am crying, because I must spread melted butter on my left hand. I think that ritual is because I must spread the butter on someone and I am unwilling to hurt someone else so I am forced to do it to myself. I resist but I must do it. I am crying at the awful brutality of having to harm myself, to save others. Now the bear is coming and I must hide. The only place to hide is inside an old wood burning stove. I crawl in backwards and am soon coated with the cold dead ashes of a previous fire. I feel sad and cornered. (156 words)

["Hiding in a crowd."] I am in a large warehouse sized room, which is very crowded with people. There are some bad guys around and I am using the crowd to mill around in as a way of hiding. Then I get braver and am organizing a talent show. I am performing and becoming more prominent in the crowd. Now I am in danger because they can easily find me. I run out the door and they chase me. I flap my arms and start flying. I have to think myself higher. Then I think to fly without flapping, or I'd get too tired. The sky is clear and blue which is bad because I'm an easy target now. They are shooting arrows at me. I take off my sleeveless white blouse and use it as a sail, attaching it to a stick (I just happen to have with me) It also conceals me so I am a bit safer. I think up a cloud and go into it to hide. (167 words)

["Swimming and my nodules are easing up."] I am in a swimming pool. It is crowded. A man, sort of Nate and sort of built like Michael, the German that Dovre likes. He is very friendly and we chat. I get out of the pool and we are standing. He comes up to me and we start to hug and kiss, it is getting sexual. Now the scene shifts and I am in an apartment, supposedly mine. I wake up and look around to discover that the landlords have been remodeling. I walk around and see to my surprise my bedroom is empty and gone, another tiny room has been added and an odd high platform I assumed would be the frame for a bed mattress, but it would be too high for me to use. I am annoyed and upset that they would come do this without even asking or telling me. I go outside. I walk down the street. No now I am in another house. I am sort of the house mother person. A man named Warren comes up to me and chats. I realize he and I had danced at some costumed ball and didn't at first recognize him. Now I see a TV film crew is setting up. They are doing a documentary on me and my family and how we do dreams together. I remember about my dream software and want to tell the director about it so we can talk about it when being filmed. I walk over to a small group of men who are busy talking about setups and shots and so on. I try to get their attention. They ignore me. I get more insistent. Finally I hear the director say to the others that they are not really interested in hearing from me. I see an outline of the topics and line after line says Law. They will do a quick sound bite about me and the kids sharing He then turns his brightly red scarfed head away from me. I say to him, "Fuck You." I turn and leave the room. I am very angry at them for ignoring me. A woman comes up to me, very close into my face and says that she wanted to interview me a bit for the 3:00 segment. I tell her about how the men treated me and how angry I am. She listens patiently and then says she will massage my left leg. I say oh no, please don't touch it. I have very painful nodules there Too painful to touch. She takes down my ugly green sock and pulls up my ugly pants leg. She begins to massage the area very gently. I am surprised it doesn't hurt but a little. She says. They are softening and going away. I am glad for that. (468 words)

["Floods and counting my pills."] I am in a house. I look out the back window and I see the water, a vast body of it, lapping right up to the window sill. I remark to some woman that it is calming and pleasant to have the water up so close. I then wonder what would happen if it rose any higher. It is raining. I go to the kitchen to find my pills. I have found some but they are huge round chewable ones and I'm not sure which ones I should take. I am now trying to replace a bottle cap and can't find the right bottle. Someone says The water is rising. I hold a milk carton, a quart sized one, in one hand and I go to the room where the window is. I see the water pouring into the house from under the window sill. Someone says we have to go higher and we all grab for whatever belongings are near us and go up the stairs to the attic. I walk the length of the house going from room to room. I think to myself, Ah, one room for women and another room for men. I open an old closet cupboard and see old world war I uniforms there. Musty and dusty. I go to the other end of the house and see some dishes and a tiny sink. I look for a small refrigerator but don't see one. I guess the milk will go sour. I go to the back room. The windows are covered with brownish tan colored shades that are nailed shut. I then look out after finding a place to peek. A long ditch is being dug by the towns people. The water seems to have receded somewhat. I am encouraged. But then the waves swell and the people in the ditches are covered over and struggle to get above water. They do. I look around the small room and see a pipe with a stream of water coming out of it. This is not good. I call for the man who comes to, look at it. Now I realize the floods have taken the house off its foundation and we are floating out to sea. I look out the window and see that we are scraping over dry land to get there, but we are floating anyway. People on the sides are shouting encouragement. One man yells look at me and is shooting a shotgun at a bird to show us how to hunt for the right bird for food. I wonder how long we will be gone. (434 words)

["Valentine cards at the wrong season."] I live in a kind of boarding house. My mother is the "house" mother. I walk downstairs. I am now sitting on a couch and trying to weave or knit something out of a soft creamy white yarn. A man sits near me on my right. He's kind of a nerd, like Charles S. of high school and a bit like the Charles I met last year at the conference in California. He seems friendly and I am not particularly interested in him. He comments on my yarn project. I show him the stitches and as he looks at them, he leans very close, and we keep brushing against one another innocently. I stand up and walk into the kitchen to find something. He follows. I see a candle is leaning too much to one side and try to position it more upright. He says Why don't you take a picture of it? As though it looked interesting. I sigh and say no, but then I change my mind and say what the heck. I go into the living room and pick up something thinking it was the camera. I am surprised to see it is a package of Valentine cards and I wonder out loud why I am addressing them at this time of year. I put them back and sit on the couch again. A woman is seated in a chair on the right. I ask do I know her? She says she thinks we were introduced. I say I don't remember you. Are you sure you didn't move in after I went away for a month? I then say I am the house mother's daughter. Oh, she says. So that's you, eh? Charles is near by again and suggests we look for the camera. I get up and go to a dresser and look around on the top. He points to a huge green plant hanging on the tall brick walls. He says I am surprised this cost $6 dollars. I say Really. Isn't it fake? He agrees it is fake. (344 words)

I am trying to ask questions of the women who are running the thing. They are at a table handing out information. One of the women reprimands me for being noisy and disruptive. I am now very upset.

["Rescued and scared."] I am on a small box adrift in the oceans, having been abandoned. A man is out there also, on another raft or box. I have drifted away from him. I have been out there for days. I am in deep exhaustion and fear. A shark or something big and dark is following. All it has to do is bump the box and spill me over and eat me. I see a dark fin rise in the water. It is near. Then it becomes a dark submarine. I slither from my box onto it and pound on the door yelling at them to help me please. Finally a crewman hears me and opens the hatch. I am now down in the submarine and in bad shock. We are walking down the narrow hallway of the submarine and there is water flowing in it up to my knees. I am terrified of the dark fish ;like shapes I see in the water. The captain is now there, sort of Kelsey, the actor from Fraiser on TV. He soothes me and I slump up against him hugging him for security. He is tender and understanding. We end up in a set of small rooms. His rooms, but they are sort of cute and domestic, curtains and a tiny kitchenette table. I am warning him that something is waiting for him down there, maybe the enemy submarine. We are becoming friends, respecting each other. Romance is a possibility. (245 words)

["Showering with the girls."] I see my dream mother who is very tired. She has been working very hard. I say come on into my room and lie down and rest. She does. I walk with her and after she is lying down, I decide to change my clothes. I go to the closet and see lots of hangers laying down in a row blocking my way to the clothes. I manage to reach through and get a dress, my purple sleeveless jumper. I am looking for a blouse too. I realize most of these clothes I'd gotten at Good will and didn't recognize them Most are too small for me to fit into. I am interrupted and I decide to walk across the long hall and change in the other bedroom, the one belonging to other siblings. I decide I need a shower and take my clothes off. I notice that along one wall of this outer bedroom are shower heads or sprinklers and water is pouring down the wall. It does not occur to me that that is the shower. Instead, I open a metal door and step in to a very long and narrow metal shower stall, where three or four other women, in colorful bikini's are already in there. I am surprised and a bit embarrassed by my nakedness. One woman says to me this is a class. Oh, I say. The shower water turns on and I get my hair wet. Just as I hear a click that I suspect will be the shut off of the water, I suddenly decide to shampoo my hair and sure enough with my hair all lathered up, the water stops. The other women are not sympathetic. (284 words)

["Lions and a cliff."] I am traveling down a narrow road, a dirt one, and I see the approaching headlights of a train. I will be run over if I don't do something. I look up at the straight up sheer cliff on the side of the road. It has grasses and other vegetation. I begin to pull myself up hand over hand on this vegetation. I get part way up, out of the way of the train. Unfortunately, a large lion, like mountain lion that is colored like Boomer comes out of the cliff, maybe a hidden den, and lies down to nap. More and more of them come out. I hold very still, hoping they don't notice me. Someone else is there and I call out to warn them. That then makes the lions notice me. (134 words)

["Running with the wolves."] I am at some gathering of women, maybe a university campus. The women seem distant and unsociable. They all begin to walk out toward the woods. I follow and soon realize that they are really wolves in human form. I become frightened. I run and they chase me. I desperately climb a tree. The wolves jump and growl threateningly at the base of the tree. I am high enough up that they can't get me. However, I see a black panther in the tree and in order to save myself I pretend to roar very ferociously at it. I am afraid but somehow it worked and the panther leaps over me and runs away to another tree. Now later, I am coming back to the campus. The women are gathered to do some performance. One woman draws a circle and chants and drums. I am suddenly hypnotized by this and lean into the circle, laying my hands and arms into it. I transform into a wolf, huge glowing eyes, big teeth and growling vicious personality. I growl and threaten. Then I run. I am being hunted down. I crawl into the bushes and slink up hill under cover, I am still in human form, but I am a wolf. Or at least I am experiencing things as a wolf. I come around a corner and peer down an embankment. I see a half grown boy playing with his baby chickens, ducks and bunnies. My eyes glitter in hungry anticipation. I slouch down the embankment and swoop down on the unsuspecting innocents. I eat the ducklings and am approaching the bunny. The human part of me is aghast that I would eat live creatures and hates the sounds of it dying. The wolf part doesn't care. It just takes and eats.

["Teaching and Counseling stopping a father's incest."] I am substitute teaching for a history and an economics class. I am walking around the tables answering questions and checking on student's work. As class is almost over, I am talking with one young woman. I realize she has been sexually abused by her father and it continues even today. Several of her siblings are in the class as well. I go to the father (who looks like that short plump man who does the Lions Duck Run fund raiser to stop abuse) and tell him this is sexual abuse and it is wrong. He denies it all. I go back to the woman, feeling I had let her down because I had said I would counsel them and help them. I feel sick about it. But the father comes back to me and says It's ok because an angel comes to him and says it is the right thing to do. I say, Ah, but that is your way of making it seem ok so you can do it. I said, You are basically a good man. You have a moral conscious and you know the difference between right and wrong. He is gratified to see I understand that. He changes his mind and agrees that I can counsel the family. (213 words)

["Annoying man in sail boat."] I am in a tiny sail boat. I had to swim to it. A woman and her grown son and another woman are on the boat. I must get in or I will drown. I fear sharks are in the water and scramble aboard. It is so small that when we all four lie down to sleep, we cover the entire boat. I am semi-curled up. The man is interested in me sexually so he lies with his fgace near me. He keeps trying to squirm closer. I try to ignore him and I am annoyed. Finally I move my face away and make it clear his advances aren't wanted. That doesn't stop him of course. Now the other woman is Kyle and he goes overboard to go to the bathroom. I suggest the other man do that too. He does, but he isn't happy about it. (147 words)

["The Dangerous Bear."] Ginny and I have taken a huge black bear into our performance. We are afraid of him, but for some reason, we want him in the performance. Right now we are rehearsing. The bear is lying down at the head of the bed, across the pillows. I am standing near the door in case he turns on us. Ginny is timidly and carefully approaching him. I say wait. We need to plan our escape should he turn on us. Ginny agrees. We decide to take a left after we exit the room, slam the door shut and race down the hall to the next set of doors and try to lock them and then, does anyone know where the elevator is? No. OK, we know where the stairs are, so we will head down the hall to the stairs. Hopefully that will give us time to escape. (147 words)

["Snow boating."] I am on top of a mountain with other people and we need to return home. I guess we are in enemy territory and we are being chased. We find a boat and decide to try and slide down the snow covered mountain in the boat. I count the people. There are twenty. I see how tightly we are packed in. We slide down to a cliff and stop. I peer over the edge and see a river with black people swimming in it. I see we are soon to leave the snow and enter the jungle. The men chasing us are near by. We get out and try to sneak through the area to get to the jungle. I lean up against a wall listening to the British and German soldiers talking, waiting for our chance to slip by them. (141 words)

["Frustration at not figuring out the categories."] I am explaining to my father, another older man and someone else what I need to complete my dream software. They each go off and try to create what I need. Cousins come by in a car and visit. Six men in a line, perhaps the cousins, as a trick or joke, all together rush at a freshly painted wall and smash their foreheads at it. This leaves an imprint for each man. They laugh. At first I am upset, but then I remember that my father had wanted such a momento. Now my father returns with lots of papers with still photographs on them. He shows them to me, excitedly explaining how this will answer my category problem. I am at a loss to see how. I need a movie or continuous stills. I see a huge machine in the right hand corner of a picture. I say to my father, but what I need to see is the machine moving. Apparently part of the story in the pictures is that a young girl gets crushed in half and dies with that machine and I need to see it to understand how to write the story well. Meanwhile, my father shows me lists of categories like Orderlies and corpsmen. I say but I don't have those categories. I try to read what he has to understand it. I can't Now I go to the window to witness the crushing of this girl. I see the front part of the machine open and she is lying on her tummy. A metal stick like thing comes down on her spine with great force and she splatters and dies. I break into a torrent of tears. The old man takes me into his lap and tries to soothe me saying don't cry. I say but I must. This is good because it means I feel the pain deep enough that I can write it well. (323 words)

I need to go out, and I go out and we're sort of in Alaska. In lots of snow. I am with some guy and he gives me a pair of earrings. They are sort of temporary. I say, I haven't worn any for awhile.

I then see the male leader is in a crib, naked, and he looks like Howard. He is lying on one side and is in shadow. I'm starting to take the earrings out. The same man is now there, dressed and not in a crib. He says you can keep the earrings on. I hesitate and then keep them in. I see he is trying to be nice to me, and so I say well, it was kind of nice to have them in again. It was a good screw. (199 words)

["Massacre and I shot the sherriff."] I am in a house. Now I walk outside to a long wooden ramp. People are out there. I have a small, very small hand gun in my right hand. I fire at people and kill them, even though 2 cops are standing very close by. A man at the end of the ramp begins to come after me. He has a big machine gun and is killing people wholesale, coming after me. I run into the house and climb the stairs until I am in the attic and find a hide hole to crawl into. The man sets the house on fire to burn me out. I am fortunate the corner I'm in doesn't burn. I crawl down the charred stairs and begin to look through a box and am checking off any items that have sugar in them. Ernie and his two boys, Ricardo and Rigo are there. Rigo asks if he can help me check off the list and I show him how to do it. (169 words)

["Getting taken care of!."] I am staying at a hotel, perhaps some convention. Jim E. writes me a note, asking me to have lunch with him, or to go to a dance. I want to change my clothes. I am very contented with the special luxury service at this hotel. I paid a $15 charge and they will do anything for me at any time. I love it I laze by the pool and then call them up and they meet me at my room to help me choose what to wear for my date. The woman who is helping me is Terry, my past personal assistant who says this service is nearly at an end and If I want her to continue I will pay her $7 an hour. I don't want to have to pay so much but I'd gotten quite used to enjoying this extra service. I look forward to the several hours in the morning when I am giving her instructions and she is doing the work. I'll probably spring for the money because I like the pampered feeling I have when she does it for me. (187 words)

He genuinely wants to change but is confused about how to do it. I tell him kindly that I can't do that. I explain that it would be unethical of me because I am a room mate and want to be there for both Tim and his wife. He understands. I offer to give him some names of people he can contact. He agrees. Now we are in another room, a bedroom, I think. Tim is in one bed and I am in the other. I am preparing for sleep. He is knitting, sitting up in bed. I ask him what he's making. He says its pants. I laugh and say let me see. He comes over to show me. I see a regular pair of jeans down to the knees and then he is knitting the rest of the pants legs. I say oh, you're not knitting pants, you are knitting pants legs. (189 words)

This was a meaningful creative piece and I am destroying it without thought. I do it to a second one as well. I am gathering up small objects out of drawers and so on. I look through a shelf of books. I am hearing some report on how A movie company in Russia wants to film in real outer space but the story isn't even about outer space, it's about love.

["Crawling up the hard way."] I am walking down a street. A man is watching me. I think he is attracted to me. The street is full of debris and potholes. I am walking toward a big freeway that intersects the street. Thousands of vehicles rushing past. I am worried about how to cross safely. A dump truck backs up toward us and is beginning to lift up the dump part to loose all the debris into the street, right where I would cross. Another man darts ahead and I now try to cross rapidly before I am buried alive under garbage and junk. But no matter now hard I try to go fast, I can barely move. I am lying on the street clawing my way trying to crawl, but still barely moving. I am afraid the dump truck will dumps its stuff on me. But I somehow persevere and make it across now I'm standing and trying to run. It's like we in an underpass. I decide at the last moment to climb up to the next level on a cement pole with metal foot rests in it like a ladder. I scramble to the top and crawl over a chain link fence only to be encountered by a stone faced cop. I made it this far and I can see life is so much better here so I aggressively stare him down and tell him to leave me alone. He does. I go on, moving normally. (244 words)

["Drunk rock and roll star sells self."] I am a man and a member of a famous rock and roll band. After the show, I lie down on the floor with a bottle of booze, very drunk. The young women are coming up to the bar to buy our services. One pays for me and I get up and we walk into a large room with benches and curtains setting off tiny cubicles on the bench, only enough room for a man to sit and a woman to sit on him. People are having sex all bunched up together like that. I look for an empty seat and find one. As I sit down, the other two cubicles beside me open up so that we lie down. I guide my penis into her and feel the extreme sexual thrill of going inside. I feel a faint orgasm. It is over very quickly. I am glad I was able to find the place to get it in. Pretty soon, another woman will buy me and I will do this over and over. I am very drunk and spacy. Someone, a man, I think looks at me like he'd like to make love to me. (I feel like I'm a woman inside, so I think he is attracted to me as a woman). But I get bored and tired and decide to walk home. I walk past him. He is lying on the grass. I pat his head sympathetically and say, "I am going to see my father." He nods. I walk down to the ocean front and wade in the surf, looking for the creek I can swim back up to my home. A woman tells me I have to be careful of the cross currents of the ocean and the creek meeting. I see a water slide on the other side and a flight of stairs going up. I am trying to decide which way I will return home and decide not to cross the creek, but to wade right up it. It's harder that way, but I want to go that way. (346 words)

He looks just like you. He does too. He stands to hug me in greeting. He is very tall and I comment on it, surprised. I feel his hard penis straight out and poking into my leg. I am surprised again. Now a male director is trying to organize us. I am looking through my scripts and can't find the last section, number 21 or 22. Others can't find theirs either. He is annoyed with us and lectures me on being responsible. I feebly try to indirectly blame it on the woman on the train who might not have given it to me in the first place. But I do remember having it. I look harder, feeling guilty and embarrassed. I do find it in my pile of papers. We are going to rehearse. (231 words)

I am getting my guitar out and notice one string is out of tune. I try to tune it, but the string comes undone and I can't get it back in correctly. My sister tries to help. We are on stage and the audience is restless and booing. Then two people in the audience start their own music, singing and guitar, they are very good! This is their way of humiliating us. I am wearing a sort of tail coat with a high pointed collar. I pull out the fiddle and begin to play with them, harmonizing and counter point. They are impressed I am so good. I walk down the aisle in the audience to join them. Now a number of people are walking up and down the aisle playing instruments, and I see with concern they all had very wide fat butts. This is the only acceptable body shape here. Of course, I look normal, which makes me abnormal. I get a clever idea and my sister and I walk, arms entwined, both of us playing. I am on the right and now she's on the left. I bow and she holds the fiddle and does the fingering. We walk down the aisle carefully, stepping together as one person. This makes our butt wide enough to be acceptable. We are playing a song. "We are having a baby, a baby, a baby. We are having a baby. Tra la, tra la, tra la. ." We step into an open suitcase and out of it without tripping or missing any notes. Everyone is impressed. We are successful. Tweedle dee, and tweddle dum. (307 words)

But now there used to be a whole bunch of books left on these shelves and now there's practically none and I know I hadn't taken away that many and I couldn't figure out what happened to the books. Meanwhile, I noticed that the shelves were on an old fold up bed and it was in terrible shape and patches of maggots and rotten material and a box of old clothes I had donated thinking so homeless people could use them, but they are just sitting there, pretty ugly and smelly. I decide to clean this stuiff up and I find a broom and a garbage can and I am scooping up masses of steamy smelly maggots and carrying these things over to the garbage can and so on and I'm trying to get things cleaned up and finally I get some other people interested and we decide we are going to throw away the old bed and the old clothes and get things cleaned up and dusted up and make it more useful.

I go to the Sheriff and ask where my friends are. All the people pull back from me, shunning me. The sheriff tells them that I am no longer just a creature, but a real person. They must learn to accept me. I feel alone and scared and disbelieving this will change and I will really be free. (163 words)

We are going to have lunch. I ask him to have lunch with me. My mother begins to set the food before us, mostly by throwing it from where she is seated on a couch which is not facing us. I say to the man, I feel uncomfortable so far away from you. I'll change my place. I move myself over to right across from him. I quickly drink my soup not really looking at him or talking. I get up to put the dishes away in the adjoining kitchen. I talk a bit with him as I carry the glass dishes into the sink. I put the pretty glass cake plate with the circle place for a cup of tea on it into the sink. I move two empty soda cans aside. As I return to get more dishes I see my mother standing at a sink full of water in the dining room, near the foot of the table. She is going to dye her hair with hydrogen proxide. She asks me how much to put on. I tell her I'm worried she'll bleach patches of her hair if she pours it out of the bottle straight on the hair. I suggest she pour it into the water in the sink and wash her hair in it. She doesn't like that idea. (255 words)

I see some crackers shaped like teddy bears (crisp bread, really) and some blonde colored sliced meat. A note from Aunt Bridget says help yourself. I look at the meat, but it looks unappetizing and I don't know how long it's been out, unrefrigerated. So I nibble on a cracker and like the taste. (103 words)

["Church Spies"] I see two men and they seem suspicious. I follow them carefully. In looking at where they were being suspicious in the woods at the side of the road, I slip and slide down a steep embankment. Into a wooded area. As I am sliding and falling, I notice lots of docu,ments and papers. I see words that say church and realize these men have stolen important papers from the church. The men are looking for me, and I lie still in the undergrowth hoping they don't see me. Then other people start searching for me too, punk teens and so on. I start running through the woods and scramble up to the road. The church men are there and want me to come back to the church with them. I say no. I don't want to. I just want to leave. A school bus, for the church kids is there. I try to get on and stumble once or twice. The children stare at me and are not helpful. In fact, they are mean and not helpful. (178 words)

["The enemy or the helper?"] Ellie and I and our babies are kidnapped and tied up and put in a car. I fight the man, hating him. We go to an old house and I manage to get enough free to knock him down. I hit him over and over with a hammer, first on the penis and then on the head. I try to kill him. I force him to lie on the floor, holding him at gun point while I also get a pair of scissors, since I can't find a knife, and cut Ellie's ropes. He keeps trying to get up and I threaten him again with the gun, which I had wrestled from him. It is broken. Ellie and I take the babies to the car and start driving away from him. He chases. We pass through a small western cow town where the people look like traditional cowboys. I think about finding a sheriff and getting help but decide this is probably his people so I don't stop. I continue driving down the straight road. Finally I stop to call for help. I learn that the man is actually trying to help us. He rescued us from our parents who were going to kill us. In fact, as soon as we were gone, they had three more babies to replace us and could care less about our well being. I am now confused and don't know if this is a good or bad guy. (244 words)

My "mom" taught me what to do with a man's arms if he should jump me. My good looking "Father" and I are also equally attracted to each other, sexually aand lovingly. He teases me about knowing what to do with a man's arms. My "Mom" keeps going outside the barn and watching off into the distance, listening intently. I say to "Dad" I wish she wouldn't do that. It makes me nervous. He grins at me and I suddenly shove him up against the wall and we laughingly wrestle. I pin his arms back and bite him hard. He has to let go. He laughs and says She taught you right. I have both his elbows in my one hand and have my other hand free to fight" him. We laugh. I am pressed up to him. He says you got me in a belly press.

So I now hold a rifle or shotgun. The three of us begin to sneak across the barn to the house to see what's up. Even the horse gets down low to the ground and sneaks across.

They see us and one comes out to threaten us. I hold the barrel of the gun right at his lower abdomen. He grins at me because I have courage, but he doesn't believe I have the strength to do it.

["Dancing like mad."] I am dressed in my sexy hot pink dress at a dance. No one else is dancing but a woman, Marilyn, from work, comes over and asks me to dance with her. She pulls me up out of the chair by the arm. I start dancing. We do exaggerated moves, going into the adjoining room, where many men are standing around talking. They laugh with us as we gaily dance around and through them. In the first room, I see they are gearing up to dance some ballroom type dancing, like the waltz and the tango. I want to join them and learn those dances, but Marilyn wants to continue our odd dance. We do. Someone comments that our style is silly. Marilyn (now Lucy) has too much arm movement and I do too much leg movement. (137 words)

["Bullseye."] I work in an office which is very crowded with desks and secretaries and other workers. My secretary is leaving on Monday and I realize, with guilt, I should be getting her a gift and throw a party. On Monday, after she is gone, there is more room. I like that. I am rearranging the desk supplies. Patsy is there and gives my secretary a wall hanging which is exactly like the one she gave us. I notice ours is broken. There is moss and little plants on the knickknack. Now a man challenges me to shoot a hole with a rifle in a small circle painted on a booth, one of a series of them up a wall of a building. I try to aim the rifle, but it keeps swinging back and forth so that I haven't got a lock on the target. I feel tense. Then I relax and intuitively wait until the swing is just before reaching the target. I fire. I hit the mark easily, each time. This impresses the man. Now I am traveling in a small moving cart to get my prize. Like an elevator, we go up the outside of the building, but my booth is over on an overhang and the cart creeps along the edge and I feel excited and scared. Another man is in the booth and he is surprised to learn I had such good skills. He asks me questions. He asks What gun do you own? I say I don't. I just have my ex-husband's rifle. How much do you practice? He asks. I say I don't. He is impressed. I ask if it's OK to stamp my own tickets. He says no, then I could get away with not paying for the tickets (like postage stamps). I get back in the cart to return. (308 words)

["Teaching the man to take care of his baby."] I am on a high mountain top. People are there, each group sitting or lying on a cot. One man and his baby lie in a cot. I go over to help him take better care of the baby, who is crying. I put some drops of milk on his nipple and place the baby there for feeding. The baby hungrily nurses. Then I pick up the baby. I see his cute face and dark black hair. He is wearing a plastic sack up to his armpits. At the bottom of the sack is milk he had drunk. I hug him and pat him. He is happy. Now it is necessary for all of us to leave the mountain top and go down the mountain. It is snow and ice and we struggle. We get to a sheltered spot around a big rock when I realize the people we had counted on to be there weren't going to show up. Bad people were coming close and we had to make the rest of the difficult journey alone without help. It is difficult, but we make it. Now we are at an outdoor fair where people sell their merchandise in booths and in old motel rooms. I walk from one to the other looking at the wares, but not interested in any of them. Some strange man, a bad politician is around. (231 words)

["Just had a baby, looking for my granmere."] I have two rooms and I have lots of stuff in both rooms. And I am packing things up and I go from one room to the other to pack up lots of clothes and papers and things. And then I'm go apparently to M City but on the way I stop at a candy factory store. I'm in my wheelchair and I go into the building and I look at the displays of candy and so on. I had gone the accessible way but I decide to go back through the front, where everybody else goes. This required going on an escalator. This is exciting. The escalator went up and all of a sudden at the top, there was this drop off and no hand rails so I looked down and I could see there was the tip of another escalator there so, I went on to that and hanging on to the round and metal handrails on the left side and I did that 2 or 3 times. Each time, I'm not quite sure the escalator will be there underneath me. Each time it was. The last escalator was a series of black padded steps that rotate and drop you from one step to another. Pretty exciting. At the bottom I see some people were watching. One had a video camera and I thought that was cool. I'm trying to find my way out to the front door and some woman dropped her bag of candies and they're all over the floor and a clerk was trying to help clean it up. It was a liquidy mess. She asks what kind of candy is this. The woman told her, because they are going to replace the candies. Now I'm not in a wheelchair because I am barefoot and am going to tip toe through the mess. Without getting any of the mess on me. Now I'm going down a long aisle like in a store. I'm in my wheelchair again. Behind me I see Mabel and Dominic. Dominic looks terrible, like he's balding and like he's had cancer. He looks old and pale. I yell behind me. Mabel, Dominic, Hi. I've had a baby. Come see. They say hi, but they don't really stop. A woman says hello did you have any luck finding GranMere Madeleine? And I realized that a year ago I was in this store looking for information about my great grandmother. And I'm embarrassed to tell her I had done nothing with the information for the past year. I wondered if I would see someone I had met doing that search. I say, well, take a look at my baby. She pokes my belly and I say that hurts. I just had a baby 2 days ago. Look at my baby and reach into my handbag. The baby is so tiny that it's cradleboard is the memo notepad like the one Dwight and Corinne gave me for my birthday. So the baby's like and inch to 2 inches in total length. I pick it up and turn it over with some concern. Hopefully the baby is still breathing. I wasn't paying much attention to it. I had kind of stuffed it into the handbag without much attention to it. But it is OK, and the baby is sleeping. I hold it in my hand to show it off and they all ooh and Ah. Then I head on out the door. I see the van. To the left appears my mother and father in a lovely red convertible sports car and they are going to drive with me and my old van and them in their lovely sports car in tandem to M City. (620 words)

I feel ok about what we did and what I learned. I get home, a four to six hour drive and Rochelle wants me to go back for more conference. It seems a waste of my time to turn around and go back, but I sigh and do so. By the time I get there, I am tired. I have lots of things to carry, luggage, purses, coats and so on. It will take 2 trips up the flights of stairs. I am frustrated about that. A woman says Hi. I tell her how hard this is going to be and she somewhat reluctantly agrees to carry my second load up for me. I feel guilty for manipulating her. Up we go and it is hard to do because each step is very narrow, hardly leaving enough room to place your foot. It's an extra flight up as well. By now I am very tired. I find the room and go in. The beds have the blankets folded up on the bed. I sigh. More work. I wonder which bed I should take, since Rochelle doesn't seem to be here yet. I decide to heck with it, I'll take the one I want.

["Opps. You didn't mean me."] I am lying in a bed. Another woman, my "daughter" is in the next one. It is in the middle of the night. I am tired but awake. I move the sheer curtains a bit to see the outside. It is raining hard. It looks a bit like M City out there. I say to my daughter, I love to watch the rain when I'm inside and warm and dry. I hear my "husband" George of Seinfeld coming tiptoeing into the house. He has brought several drunk women with him. One I know and another is the band singer from the lounge they were at and some of her children. Young teen girls. This is the last straw. I see George peeking around the door nervously checking to see if their giggles and drunk stumbling around has awakened me. I call him in and he lies down at the foot of the bed like a naughty puppy. I say this is it. I'm through. He groans, no. I say yes. This is no good. I'm not good for you and you're not good for me. We hurt each other. He begs with me. He holds out an old Mexican blouse, embroidered, I got from a trip to Mexico. He wants me to wear it so I'll be warmer but I say no. It doesn't fit me anymore. I wouldn't feel comfortable at all. It would, in fact, make it worse. He is very sad. Now the bad singer is in my room and seated at the piano playing. I sigh. I say please don't. I need to sleep. Then one of the girls is introduced to me. Her father is some beginning charter member of a charity organization. I am out of bed and standing by now. I commiserate with the band singer about her tough lifestyle. Then she says she is going to make a big contribution to the charity in the name of Mary Ellen. I am surprised. That is my name and I begin to demure. Then the girl speaks and I realize she is the Mary Ellen they are talking about. I am embarrassed and back away abit. Now we are someplace else. We stand in front of a full refrigerator. I see the doors are open and I say the photo would look good here with the full refrigerator. After all the charity is giving hungry people food. I stay on the outer edges of the group and watch. I feel embarrassed. (417 words)

["Weird train tracks and Mrs. Snowman's son."] A man is talking to us. He points off into the distance where I see train tracks and roads going perpendicular to us. He is complaining about these roads and tracks. He says this is what I don't like about them. Now he drags me onto the track which are unstable, no ties holding the tracks together and a long drop off below. It has bumps on the metal tracks so that I am very frightened I'll fall off as we go. He doesn't notice or care and drags me along lecturing in a complaining tone. He says this road isn't safe either and now I am next to a set of long shelves with food stacked on it like a grocery store. I am to find hand and toe holds where food isn't to hang on while a train passes so I won't get run over. I move carefully from one hand hold to another. At one point, there is no handhold and I say to the man I guess under these circumstances I just squish the food. After all, the only other alternative is for me to get squished. He nods in agreement. I get back on the path and am returning to where we were. Now we are walking out of a cafeteria where a man is at the cash register. I look back at him as we get to the doors. His back is to me and he is gossiping with the other employees. He is talking about everyone and specifically I remember he said well, I guess Mrs., Snowman's real proud of her son. Apparently Mrs. Snowman is his nick name for a cool well endowed woman that works there. He is being sarcastic. People don't really like his constant gossip. It puts people down. (300 words)

["Howard and the baby."] I don't know where I am, a large area. I am looking at photos I cut out of the girls. I show them to Howard and point out to him that they were photos he took of them when he was taking care of them. I was artistically cutting them out and putting them together in a collage work, where many of the photos are like pictorial totem poles, long, with many different things in a line, vertically. I realize in the back of my mind that apparently Howard and I are living together again and in fact, have sexual relations now. I feel vaguely surprised and uncomfortable. A short woman who had been having a baby in my last dream comes through and hugs me and I am shocked to realize she had passed as my husband for a short time and I am relieved I don't have to hug her. She walks on. Now I have a baby who seems hard to keep hold of. It is not too well and I'm getting it checked up. I and another woman are going to some booth where they are selling Christmas decorations. I look at them, not too interested. Boring stuff. Cloth dolls and candles. I can't seem to find the place where I take the baby for a medical check up. (223 words)

She is not cooperative. She is vague and slippery. He goes to her house and goes in. A maid takes him to the living room. He sees a box of journals and asks the maid if that is the woman's diaries. She says yes and then leaves. He sneaks over to read them, and as he does he realizes that the woman is really the alien. I see images of the woman's face and I watch as it transforms in a series of images to an ugly brown pop eyed alien face. The woman comes in and seems relieved he knows. It seems a friendly relationship. (139 words)

["By bike or by car?"] I am in a house. It is supposedly Lucy's home. I am cutting out articles about an incident in the newspaper. It's her newspapers and the article is about something, an accident, that happened to her. But I want them so I take them, rationalizing she can't read them anyway. I am packing to leave. I have a bike and a car. I can't decide which one I should take home with me now. I decide on the car and then change my mind and go on the bike. I coast down steep hills and pedal hard up the other side. I stop at a wayside and rest, feeling guilty about taking the articles. I should have asked permission. Now there are people around. I am going to sleep on a cot. A girl, like Charla is with me. She brings me a box of Kleenex. I say thanks and offer the little boxes inside it to others. Soon lots of people have boxes of Kleenex. Then I realize Charla had taken the box without permission and it is the supplies for the vending machine which sells these Kleenex boxes to the public. Now I owe a bunch of money for having given them all away. (206 words)

I ask a man, perhaps my brother Jake, where's my 32" TV set. He says he doesn't know. I am upset. A woman is there too. I then see a small baby, with blood on it's face. I realize the man has been hitting the baby. Abuse. I am more upset and realize I can't turn my face away on this. I may be week about the TV's being stolen, but I can't ignore the baby abuse. I am looking for the phone. I find it and call 911. There is a long wait. The man and the woman are very upset with me for calling 911. I am resolute. This must be done. (143 words)

["Libeled."] There is a large wedding happening and I am watching. Perhaps I am also the bride. A gangster kind of family. The family is gathered around a huge square of tables and making toasts. One man, an uncle of the groom, makes elaborate grimaces as he speaks and I watch with interest. Perhaps that is a family ritual or habit. The groom and I write a small 4 lined poem. It is amusing, about two animals, one perhaps a turtle, another perhaps a bird. We enjoyed writing it. But soon we read a critical review of the poem. The entire family, and indeed the entire town is up in arms about this poem. They ridicule me for being wrong about the theme or premise of the poem. I didn't know my subject matter, they say. I laugh and say to someone well, they have a point. I made that mistake, but I was writing the poem from another point of view and so it didn't seem to matter for what I was trying to do. The people are unforgiving. They refuse to speak to me. I am being completely ostersized. I begin by being a big embarrassed and gradually progress to anger. I demand to see the mayor. He is upstairs in a building and refuses to see me. The secretary is rude. I finally snap and push past her walking rapidly up the stairs yelling at him that I am coming up and he will talk to me. I find him in his office and threaten to sue him for civil liberties. I tell him off. (267 words)

["Communicate with the man mentally."] Two men are interested in me. They are courting me. I am not sure which one to choose. They both seem nice. The one more distant from me physically I see more. I seem to be more attracted to him. He mentally sends a group of people to come up to me and surround me. They stand very close all around me, as I am sitting. They stare at me. Somehow this is an extension of the man's mind as he learns about me. I begin to send mental signals back to him and actually start to feel what he feels and hear what he thinks. I realize I've had this capability for about a week. He is pleasantly surprised to discover I can now connect with him telepathically. I choose him and move through the people to sit next to him. We are happy. (145 words)

["Old friend returns."] I am on vacation with Dovre. We rented a couple of rooms. We are walking down an area and a man comes up to me. He has dark pretty hair and a trim beard. I realize he is an old friend from years ago. Sort of like Archie and sort of like Nat III. We hug and talk. I am happy to see him, and he me. We kiss and he is impressed, saying I am a good kisser. We walk together. He ignores his friends and I ignore Dovre because we are so immersed in one another. He changes his clothes for dinner and comes to me. I am standing at the opened trunk of a car. I comment on the nice sweater he is wearing. It is knitted and white. A cardigan. He is embarrassed. Someone gave it to him, he doesn't particularly like it. I say in defense, well, it looks very collegiate. We walk over to my rooms, so I can get ready for the dinner. I show him each room. The living room, the bath room. The stairway to the bedroom. The bedroom. Dovre goes to take a shower and we fall upon each other and make wild love. (204 words)

["Don't neglect the babies."] I am now responsible for two babies that my mother had but doesn't pay any attention to any more. She's had other babies and lavishes care on them but neglects the first ones. I resent this and feel bad for the abandoned babies. The same thing happens with Lucy. I am taking care of her first babies too. I try to explain to her that she is neglecting them. She doesn't seem to care or hear it. In my explanation, I use a horizontal metal bar that is a part of her couch we sit on. I say horizontal. She thinks about it and uses the baby's legs as an axis to get a spatial picture of horizontal versus vertical. She traces a line across the spread legs and says Christmas, right? (132 words)

It is necessary for me to get out of the way but at the last moment I decide to grab some of the papers I want for a later meeting. I shuffle through the piles having a hard time deciding what to take. I feel frustrated. I give up and decide not to do this, and not take much with me. I walk out to my waiting ride. (131 words)

I smile at my father as he walks through the living room. I hint that he should write me some original music. He laughs and says no way. That would take too long. I then comment that if I get music from someone else, it will be copyrighted. He doesn't take the hint and leaves the room. I go down a hall to visit Dwight's room. He's hanging out. He has no suggestions for me. (106 words)

But he seems to be attracted to me in a casual way. He lets me hang out with him. He insists I cut my hair very short. It already is a short ball of curls, with multiple colors in it. His mother laughs at me as she mimics snipping my hair down to the scalp. She takes a snip out of it in the front. I go to him and say why do I have to cut my hair? I like it this way. This is pretty brave of me. He grins and I know it's ok. (125 words)

The others are set up all ready. We climb up to the door using a metal ladder attached to the wall. It is a difficult climb. The rungs are thin and bend easily. I now find my space. My desk is set up right by the fireplace. I announce I like this space. The space to my right is my "father's." He's dead. I see a man's figure sitting at his desk. All I see is his back. I call out to my father's spirit. I then see a bright opaque swirl of colored lights on the ceiling. I tell the others this is my father's spirit. (141 words)

["Rape and Kill."] I am in my bedroom. I get up and go into the bathroom. Carlos comes in with the intent to rape me. He grabs me and I struggle. I shove him away and escape into the living room. He now has a gun. I call 911. I can barely see and my movements are slow motion. I try to remember my address. I finally remember 2nd and Elm. It's like my memory is going. Then I remember 2127. Carlos is approaching and I start to duck and hide in the computer room. There is a blue mat standing on its side. I hide behind that. Carlos is near. I grab the gun. He wounds me. I now have the gun and Carlos is lying on the ground. And still trying to hurt me. I finally shoot him in the shoulder. Now I feel angry and righteous. I have the right to kill him. I feel some restraint of compassion but it is small compared to the desire to kill him. I shoot him three more times in unvital areas. Finally, the police arrive, but it now looks like I am the aggressor and they want to arrest me. Carlos grins and tells them I tried to seduce him and then attacked him. I am furious. (215 words)

["Don't want a boyfriend."] I have moved into a house. I don't like the town, a small traditional place out in the country. Dovre is there, helping me, only she put my rug that belongs on the living room floor over the rug I already have on the bedroom floor and then the excess goes out into the living room. It is wrinkled and messy. I am unhappy about that. I go into the bathroom, as I just woke up. I look out a window and see a huge diesel truck near by. The driver is looking in out of curiosity. I am annoyed. I go out for a walk. When I return, I see a glass enclosed porch where women are cooking. I realize it is my kitchen. I go into the house. The women call me into the kitchen. They say the townsmen are ready to look me over now. They are interested in courting me. I don't want that. I am annoyed again. I leave the glass kitchen and go into a living room where five men are seated, waiting for me. I shake each one's hands and say Hello. I feel uncomfortable. I don't want any of these men. I don't want anyone. I want them to go away. (209 words)

Jean-Luc Picard accompanies me to the surface and then turns to go back down to try and save the ship from exploding. He turns to his left and says "Michael." The Warf character is there. He also volunteers to go back down. They swim down to a sandy silt ledge where yet another crew member is pacing back and forth, guarding. His feet are silly, like a clowns. There are three objects down there and they are going to explode. Capt. Orders the others to go up to the surface with two of the objects. He stays behind to bring up the third one, the most dangerous. It is on the verge of exploding so he releases it and pushes it to the right. That momentum forces him into the same path. The thing explodes. I think the Capt. Survives. (167 words)

["Is it OK to be lovers?"] Ricardo and I are seated side by side in a vehicle. I am where the drivers seat is and he is on my right. He is much younger than me. He leans over to kiss my belly. He nuzzles a little roll of fat on my side. I feel awkward and uncomfortable. I wonder if this will be OK with his parents. I tell him we should ask his parents permission. His father shrugs and says I guess it's all right. His mother says no way. This is wrong. I don't approve. Ricardo still wants us to make love. He brings me a small metal boat and holds it steady in a pond. I start to get in it. We are going to float around on the pond to be alone. But the boat is unstable and Ricardo is rocking it around. So water is splashing in. I hesitate, not wanting to get in and sink. So he brings a small kayak. It is also unsteady. Now he is walking around in the shallow pond, away from me. I walk toward him, wading. I look down into the water and I see something swimming by. I look more closely and see that it is a woman who is either sleeping or stoned on drugs. She is smiling. Another young woman is floating with her, in the same condition. I am concerned for them. What if they are so unconscious that they drown. I keep walking toward Ricardo, but I keep looking back at the women, concerned. I see another set of women like that. Now I am carefully walking over a fallen tree trunk, very old and gnarled. It is ancient and beautiful. There are currents and eddies and odd mysterious things in this pond and Ricardo seems to keep disappearing further away as I observe what is around me. (310 words)

["Black baby is eaten."] I enter a room. I see a plump, cute black baby lying there. He is sucking on a pacifier vigorously. He has it all the way in his mouth. I remove it but he wants it, so I find a bigger one, with a shield on it. He sucks on it so hard it slips completely into his mouth. I am worried he will choke. I take it out. I pick him up and hold him. He smiles. I look in his eye. It has mechanical little squares in it. I am surprised. Is this an alien baby? I put him down. I look around the room. I look back at him and notice he has changed into a snail like creature. Another odd animal is beside him. As I watch in horror, the animal eats the snail. I am sick with horror. I try to grab the animals mouth but it is too late. I wonder how I can possibly tell the baby's mother he was eaten while I was caring for him. I am shocked and worried. (179 words)

As I walk through the house, I keep finding more rooms. One is a tiny thing where the floor is rotten through. I look down and see a busy industrial establishment. A large truck drives through as I watch. I wonder if the exhaust fumes come up into my house. I see Lucy walking near this room and am concerned she will fall through the rotten spaces in the floor. In the kitchen I see a hutch with things on it. I want to move it so it will look better. I go into another room, surprised to find another one. Terence is around somewhere. (138 words)

My father asks a man to bring us a prepared lunch. I open mine, and find a bunch of square things with general information on them. I see packages of cheese or milk. I ask a man if every time I want to eat lunch I will get this same package of square informational things. He says yes. That seems a real waste of resources. (101 words)

["Falling in love with a drag queen"] I am very sad. I feel alone and unloved. I am in some tunnel of cement and curved lines. A naked black man is there and he is sympathetic to my feelings. He walks ahead of me trying to coax me into following him to see a friend who can supportively counsel me. I think there is an underground river to the left that I was sitting next to. I slowly follow him. He tries to jump up a cement jut where the tunnel branches into two. He slips and falls on his butt. He laughs at his antics. He's trying to cheer me up. I feel sad and lonely. Now he leads me to a friend. Sparky. She says she'd like to hear what's troubling me. Another woman is there who was going to tell her troubles but she says it's OK for me to go ahead first. She'll learn from my situation too. I suddenly decide to not talk and let the woman go first. I wonder why I did this, because it would be right and a good thing for me to talk. But I hold myself in. The black man is now dressed as a drag queen. He cavorts around in a flashy way. I am now trying to adjust my clothes. I have a skirt that rides up into my butt crack and a see through blouse so it is obvious. I keep trying to adjust it, but it reverts back as soon as I let go of it. This feels embarrassing. I can't walk around looking like this. So I try to put a pair of jeans on. I stand up and walk over to the black drag queen and straddle his lap. I say I don't know what I'm supposed to be a man inside and a woman outside, or a woman outside and a man inside. I feel confused. Then I say to him. What would happen if I loved a drag queen? Would I have to just wait until he's ready? (340 words)

I get the dishes done and look over at the stove. There are lots of very dirty dried on food pans waiting. I don't want to wash them. We decide to soak them. I tell Theresa we should put away the food so it won't spoil. She says she'll slice up her turkey and we'll put it away. Then I'm in the next room setting up some pieces of papers on a table. We are going to do collage like art work. Lots of people, maybe the whole tribe will be involved doing this. I chat with some nice guy. (155 words)

A cat had changed into a baby. The baby that was a cat is plumper and healthier than the other baby. The real baby has red circles under it's eyes. I carry them around with me, one in the crook of each arm. I want to take care of them good, now and am appalled I neglected them so long. I just forgot to take care of them. I walk into another room and with my foot pull out a trundle bed from the couch. I want to put them there to nap. A man is there, he is a neighbor, but we actually live in the same part of the building. His bedroom door is to the right. Which opens into the room I'm in and my bedroom is off the same room on the left. (208 words)

He asks me to sort out some papers for him. I do that. I wonder if we are going to sleep together that night. I assume we will, but no one has actually said the words. I have a wooden tent like accommodations all picked out in case. He says his Mother lives near by. We can stay at her house tonight. I ask if she is going to mind us being together. He smiles and says it doesn't matter. I know now we are going to sleep together. The age difference bothers me a bit. (127 words)

She grudgingly gets up and steps aside so I can walk on the sidewalk. She is annoyed with me. I continue. Now I see a woman evangelist sitting on a large wooden structure. She is preaching to one lone woman seated on a bench across from her. The listening woman looks bored. I pass between them. As I continue, I see other people standing around on the sidewalk. I walk with effort and concentration, kind of surprised I can manage this long. (114 words)

["Turn off the radio"] Charla and I are going to a special meeting at her school on Sunday. I keep trying to position my wheelchair so I can face the two women speakers. I can't seem to find them. I decide I need to turn off the radio, it is annoying me. I find the radio and push a number of buttons but no matter which one I push it won't turn off. I feel frustrated and I give up. Now I am outside and walking. It is slippery. I see a stream of water ahead and realize I can't step over it. So I choose to go uphill, slipping on the wet grass and mud. I make it to the sidewalk. I see the bus Charla and I will take. Now a young woman, perhaps Dovre, and I are wearing push up halter tops that are black and strapless. I mold mine to hold in my left breast, as I noticed it was sort of dropping out a bit. As I approach the bus, a man approaches and makes lewd remarks. I feel annoyed by him. (183 words)

["Growing computers."] I am in a field planting old computers in a row. I finish my work and look over the field where many green plants are thriving. I pick off a flowering fruit that is forming. I taste it and am very pleased. It is moist and sweet and slightly crunchy. Someone asks me what this all is. I point out the beginning of the first row and say that was a Compaq computer, and that was an old Commodore 64. It even has the old fashioned keyboard with the shift button on the left. There is an Atari. (98 words)

["Secret bus"] I am walking in an open area. I see some boxes and racks with used items there. I dig around and find a purse and a sundress. I am going to buy them, but then I notice the purse's handle is missing and has a seam open. The dress doesn't have an elastic waist, so I won't fit into it. I decide to leave them, although I like the openings on the purse. I can manage them with my hands. There are people there that are part of a secret group, called the MOI. I follow them, searching for their secret headquarters. I see a bus and get on it. I am now in a wheelchair and notice the bus is very spacious, allowing great accessibility for the chair. I see a display panel and look at it closely. I find an ensignia of the MOI there and realize I have found their secret place. I continue to casually observe as I wheel down the aisle which is a grassy path. There are no visible signs of the bus. No floors, or walls. It looks like I'm strolling down a meadow path. At the back end of the bus, I see some young men in suits who are part of the MOI crew. I notice they have sleeping quarters and a bathroom set up back there. They watch me suspiciously. I pretend to be an innocent tourist. (237 words)

["Giraffes in the new house"] I am looking over a series of rooms I am thinking of moving into. The rooms are run down and as I go from one room to another, I notice they aren't closed off from the rest of the building. I walk from one room into another not realizing I had entered someone else's room. I back out, embarrassed. I choose one room to be Charla's bedroom. Now Robert Downing is there. He is my son. He wants to move in with us. I am hesitant. He's an addictive personality and trouble, but he is my son. We enter another room and I see a glass display case with jewelry in it. I am pleased to find something the previous owners left. I don't particularly like the jewelry itself. I comment they will make good Christmas gifts for friends. I see a pile of wooden carved giraffes. I am very happy. I say oh good, these are my totem animals. This is a good omen. We walk down another hall to reexamine Charla's room. It is big but the hall from it simply opens out into the building. I don't like that. Now Robert and I walk outside the building to return to the first room. Each room is in a different building, it seems. (215 words)

["Fireworks and cute critters"] I am in a room. I ask where my father is. They say he's up on the hill setting off the fireworks so we can enjoy them. I look out a high wide window and see fireworks and black puffs of smoke. I notice it is daylight and ask why he didn't wait for night so we could see them better. The colors are faded. Someone says it's because some people who would enjoy this won't be here later. I go sit on a couch. I see an odd critter, sort of like a furry deer with a flat wide head. I am sure it will run away if I reach out to pet it. I touch it and suddenly it leaps up on the couch beside me and wants to be petted more. Very affectionate. I am amused. It is cute. (142 words)

["Sneaking a Peek"] I am talking with some nice man. I kind of like him. He has a locker and I happen to notice the combination numbers he uses to lock it. I decide to sneak into his locker and look around. I do that and pull out books and papers and his drawing pad. I am hoping I find some journal entry that talks about his meeting me and how he feels about me. But I am embarrassed and feel guilty. So I barely look as I flip through the pages. I know this isn't right. I notice he is a very good artist. Lovely colorful pictures. I put the things back in the locker. I realize he will know someone has been rifling through his things because I can't remember where things were, exactly. I want to go hide. I feel shamed. Now either I have to go confess to him or not get involved with him, because I couldn't handle the thought of being dishonest with him. I am sorry I ever opened his locker. I feel sad because now I've ruined a possibly good relationship. (186 words)

["The Horse Breaks a Leg"] I am in a room. There are two or three fireplaces. There is a huge stone hearth in front of the fireplaces. A fire burns in each fireplace. As I watch, I see bits of burnt wood spark out onto the hearth. I am grateful it lands on the stone and not on the floor or the couch. I move the couch away from the fireplace. It is on a downhill slant. I don't like that. I look at the stone wall near the fireplace. It has sparkling places. I look more closely and see quartz crystals and amethyst crystals which reflect the fire. It is pretty. I look over at the other fireplace. I see smoke pouring out of it, into the room. Now I am worried about toxic smoke inhalation. I say I need a fan and then see a button on the wall. I turn it on and a fan starts up. It clears out the smoke. I then see a black device on the wall. I look more closely. It appears to be some kind of camera lens with a series of f-stops on the multiple lenses. I have no idea what it does. Now there are aliens in the room. One has a round fat tummy. I don't want him to stand so close to me that we touch. He leans forward and touches his small purple tongue to my mouth. I pull back, feeling uncomfortable. Then I look out the window. I hear some people playfully racing their horses down the street. But they are careless. One horse slips and falls badly. I feel sick when I hear him fall. I look and see that his back legs are bend. I think he's broken his legs and will have to be shot. I feel very upset and distressed for the horse who was driven carelessly and must now pay with pain and perhaps death. The horses face is full of suffering and pain. I want to cry. (333 words)

["God Help ME"] I am observing a young woman who has two boyfriends. One is her main boyfriend, and the other is a new one that she is attracted to and he to her. She is quite torn as to which one she loves more. She is miserable. She and her woman friend are in a crowded restaurant. The woman friend sees her boyfriend, and picks up a coffee pot, a gift from the other man and holds it up for him to see. She calls to him to get his attention. The young woman is shocked and angry. She says How could you do that!. The friend follows the boyfriend outside repeating her message. The boyfriend is extremely upset and hurt. The young woman walks angrily back into the crowded restaurant. Her friend returns with her. The restaurant is crowded with waiters who stand on top of each other's shoulders and wait tables in this acrobatic way. The boyfriend places himself in a harness that holds him suspended up from the floor about three feet. He is sort of like the waiters, doing a showy act for the customers. But while he is there, he arches his back in frustration yelling repeatedly "God help ME!" Meaning let me be the one she stays with. (212 words)

["Keeping the Animals Safe"] I own a large run down house where I keep exotic animals. Lion cubs and a sort of furry dinosaur, and many other animals. I let them roam free. The house has a long front yard that goes to the ocean. In the house are stone outcroppings just like outdoors. I use them as sort of stairs. Some of the house is unfinished. The stones lead up to a wall for example. The dinosaur goes wild and is potentially harmful. I need to put it up in a room in the house. I struggle to get it up there. I feel bad that I have to lock it or any of the animals up like in a zoo. I am enjoying the fresh air in the yard and notice a lion cub is loose. I am concerned it will be hurt by the dinosaur. I pick it up, cuddling it. As I am walking around with it, I see two men who are going to harm the animals. Now the dinosaur is loose and swimming in the ocean. I get into the passenger side of the car. The two men are in the driver's seat. I pull out a shotgun and point it at their heads. I say if you don't stop, I'll blow your heads off. They smirk. I aim at their shoulder and shoot. This scares them and they jump out the open window on the driver's side. The car is moving fast and I struggle to get into the driver's seat to stop it before we plummet into the ocean. Too late. I feel the impact of hitting the water. I feel the sinking of the car in the deep water. I am also aware that the impact is softer than it would be normally. I struggle out of the window and start to swim back to shore, with my shotgun in my hand, on the lookout for the men. I see one up on a hill. I return to the house and run up a long flight of stairs. I see my staff, now a large group, working. I warn them about the men. (358 words)

["A Sad Story of Love and Betrayal, 1940's style"] I watch a young woman and I am sort of the young woman. We live in an apartment building. My room is sort of open to the hall. I have a single bed and it faces a wall partition that has a box on it, with things from the previous owner on it. The place is cluttered. I am cleaning up. I open a box with magazines in it I had been saving for a long time. I open one magazine. I see cut out pictures of a cute dog. It is black and white. It is called a pop eyed dog. I like the picture but resist keeping it. I throw it away, even though I think it is cute. I see the box on the wall has holes in it and look in. There are shelves in there with lots of stuff on them. I start rearranging things. I fold up a cardboard cutout of a miniature piece of furniture. I think it is a dresser. I see framed pictures on the wall. I don't particularly like them. They were left by the previous owner and I never bothered to take them down. A man comes into my area. I try to ignore him. I don't like him. He lives in a neighboring apartment. I see him sit on a bed next to mine and I watch as he does stretching exercises. I see he has a thick build, like Ernest Borgnine. But his legs are very thin and lacking muscle, like a para. He is dressed in a T-shirt and his boxer shorts. I roll under the bed to pretend to sleep and avoid him. Now I am walking down the hall of this old 1940's style apartment building. The neighbor man is attracted to me and calls me into his room on some pretense. After we are in there, he unbuttons my dress and exposes my breasts. I the dreamer is looking on. I am surprised to see her breasts are so small, they are practically non existent. The man wants to fondle her. She is upset and runs out of the room to escape. She runs across the hall and into the bedroom of another man who is sleeping. She kind of likes him. He has been kind to her. He is in bed sleeping and she crawls in beside him saying in sobs, can I sleep here? He is surprised. I the dreamer is surprised and pleased to see it is the actor Al Pacino playing a role of a working class man. He has a gap in his teeth. I am delighted with his acting skills of taking on this unusual role for him. He at first assumes she wants sex and tries to touch her breasts. She is curled up and says no. I just want to sleep here. He sees she is upset and allows her to lie there as he comforts her. Meanwhile, I see the father coming down the hall. He is going to find them sleeping together and assume the worst. He is going to go after the man and force him away. It is a sad story. (530 words)

["Another time, swept away."] My brother Dwight and I are on a raft in some river. We are right next to the bank, which goes straight up like a cliff. There is a canopy roof over us. I notice beautiful waterfalls, like sheets of running water over the face of the cliff and point them out to Dwight. Then I suddenly realize we are in danger. The water is increasing. One sprouts up right next to us. I yell to Dwight to help me get the raft out from under the canopy before the water rises suddenly. We just barely get out in time. We are moving downstream when a wall of water comes washing down and over us. It pushes the raft and us over a cliff into a huge lake. It is so big that I can't see the land anywhere. Then I see smoke stacks way off to the left. Then I see some houses with spires on them and cars near by on the right. I think to myself that there can't be cars here because somehow we had traveled back in time. The cars disappear. We move to the dock near the houses. And get out on land. A young man comes up and an older couple. They are dressed like in the 1600's. Pilgrims sort of. They are upset that I am wearing pants. I go back to the raft and find a dress, it's not in their style, but it's a dress. They ask us to come in. We do so. A plump woman asks us if we are married and I laugh and say no. She is shocked and faints. I then hastily explain we are brother and sister. This is a very religious family. We are now eating dinner with them. They finish and say they will now go have a family prayer meeting. We are left at the table alone. The young man peeks in from the door to the outside and asks us to meet with his friends secretly outside. They have some secret revolutionary group going. We go out. The steps are very steep and at the bottom, the young man catches me in his arms. We cling to each other, very attracted to each other. Then we scramble over a small hill and hide with the others. Now I see three geeky men, dressed like cowboys. The are standing in a row by a fence. One comes up to me. He wants to kiss me out of curiosity. I see the young man jealously watching and I decide I want to make him jealous. I agree to the kiss, but the young man is angry now and comes over to grab me from the man's arms. We embrace and cling to each other fiercely. He professes his love and now sad and lonely he will be when I return from where ever I came from. We are deeply in love and sad. (491 words)

["Letters from Brian, wish I knew who he was."] I am working hard and feel very tired. I fluff up some pillows and prepare to rest on a big easy chair. Another woman friend is also tired and takes my place. I see this and happily give up my spot for the other side of the chair. There are two large holes in the corners of the chair and I stuff a big brown pillow in it and arrange a few more for comfort. I curl up. Now I get up to look for some letters I received. I had gotten a postcard from someone named Brian and I wrote back. Only I can't remember who Brian is. I got three letters. Big fat ones. My name Beverley is written three times across the envelope. I am excited about receiving these letters. They look like they will be fun to read and full of information from the past. I try to think who Brian is. Maybe an elementary school chum. Maybe I met him at Aunt Millie's. I open his letter. He has a whole list of facts about my Grandma Agnes' family on this paper. I begin to eat the paper. It tastes very good. I then realize that I am eating the facts before I even read them. I don't want to lose the information, so I nibble around the margins, because I really like the taste of this paper. It is crunchy like potato chips. (239 words)

["Like the Kennedy family."] I am a young woman who visits a very large family. There are perhaps 11 or more adult children and the male head of the family. It reminds me of the Kennedy family. We are called into a large room with three or four couches. They all sit on the couches and I am amazed at how much furniture is required for so large a family. The older man lectures to his children. At one point he walks up to the son and leans into his face and says sex. He means they shouldn't be thinking about sex and relationships, but getting on with their careers. He then comes over to me to get acquainted. I need a crochet hook to make something. He walks me over to his daughter who is severely disabled in a wheelchair. He leans over to her and says No Tim. He means she shouldn't be thinking of her boyfriend Tim. They help me find some crochet hooks. But they are all too big. I see the size J. I need smaller. We search around for awhile. The son comes over to talk. He is attracted to me, as I think the father is. I am shy. (202 words)

["Center of Attention"] I am seated in a large crowd of people. Way up at the top of the bleachers are the important people who perform. I am leaning back on the ample bosom of an older woman, feeling relaxed and comfortable. I watch a man doing a performance. He is racing on the ice covered ground, running from something that could get him.The man tries very hard but doesn't quite make it. Now the important woman at the top of the bleachers is making a public speech about his performance. She then suddenly starts talking about me and how I will criticizes his work because I am always critical in a negative way. I am surprised and angry she speaks like this about me in public. I stand up and announce that I am not critical of his performance. I in fact think it was wonderful. The fact that he almost but not quite made it successfully was even an added plus to the excitement and poignancy of the performance. I am furious at the woman and stare up at her. The older woman and a younger woman seated next to us are very aware I may blow up and be caustic in my speech with this woman. They are trying to calm me down. But I stand up and walk toward the woman who is descending the stairs. I grab her with a cane behind the neck and jerk her around and force her to the wall. I lean into her and tell her off, angrily. How dare she berate me in public and so on. Then I walk away in a huff. When I sit back down, a woman comes up to me and says look at that. You did it again. Two years ago, you sat on the stage itself, and was the center of attention. Last year, you accidentally sat with the important people and was the center of attention. And now you managed it again!!

["Bone Density"] I am watching as a woman is standing in the street, shocked that she has survived a holocaust. She says I must have had enough bone density. Millions of people had been killed because they didn't have it. She is relieved she has survived, but she watches as other survivors search for their loved ones. They come into a huge warehouse to search through millions of bones and skeletons. There is no hope they can identify one from the other, it is an overwhelming task. The woman and I look on in sadness and empathy as a crying grieving woman hopelessly goes to the bone pile to try against all odds to find her loved ones. (116 words)

["Reaching for God"] I am at a church service that is very beautiful. After the service, two other women and I walk to another church. Our belief is that our own service is so right and beautiful that we can go to other kinds of services and enjoy them without judgment. We go to another church where an old man is the preacher. He is talking on a microphone off in a corner but his voice is booming through the congregation, sort of like the old man in the Wizard of Oz who is revealed behind the curtain. He is saying that there are 8 paintings that are sacred and special. As the women and I leave, we say it's interesting. Not like our service. But it's OK if they want to believe that God is a painter. We walk across a top of some high cardboard like we're on top of a cardboard box. We are going to the next church. We come to the end of the cardboard and there is a steep ladder. I am in high heels. I shake my head no. I say I don't know what I was thinking, not taking the elevator. I can't go down this ladder. Will you be upset with me if I don't go with you to the next church? They smile and say no problem. I turn and walk back toward the elevator. I see a man. We talk. I hug him and am in his lap. I say to him. I love you. The man is distressed. I say don't be upset. It's all right if you don't return my love. I do this twice. Now I feel like dancing. I find a spot on the gymnasium like floor where it's not as crowded and begin to dance like I'm Ice Skating. I swirl and glide gracefully. People stop to look. Someone puts a spotlight on me. As part of the dance, I leap up to grab hold of a crystal chandelier. This represents reaching for God. It is beautiful. The crowd admires my dancing. I am touched by the motion of reaching for God. It is very spiritual. (359 words)

["Nate in the photo"] A woman has taken a photo of Nate and I and another woman. She shows it to me. It is already printed up in a newspaper. I like the picture, but I am uneasy. I say to her that Nate and I used to be lovers and maybe his wife will see the picture and put it together. Nate comes in and I show him the picture, explaining what I told the woman. He smiles and says it's probably OK to print the picture. Since the other woman is in the middle between us, the wife won't figure it out. It looks perfectly normal and explainable. (106 words)

["Center of Attention"] I have a black suitcase, more like a briefcase. It has a game inside it. You push a button and round disks, brown colored and sandpaper like, move around. I get bored easily with this game since nothing much seems to happen. Perhaps it is broken. I open up the case and clean everything out of it. I have a bunch of quarters and odds and ends. I gather up the quarters. I hear John Lithgow talking to another man. He is telling him that he shouldn't be such a hog with the center of attention in the group circle. I smile at the fact that it is John himself that seems to need to be the center of attention and he is jealous of the other fellow's share. (129 words)

["Sawdust Eating MaMa"] I am in a garage with Charla. She wants to drive my little red car. She gets into the driver's seat. I don't want her to drive. I tell her she is only 11 years old. But she starts driving anyway, in the garage. Slowly moving forward, she bumps into a large box. She then backs up and bumps into something else. I finally take the steering wheel from her and stop the car. I am sitting in the driver's seat and I feel a strong wind pushing at my back. It's a breezy garage. Now I am walking with my "father." He is human, but my "mother" was a sawdust eating creature. We walk across a flatland area to a huge tunneled out building in a mountain. The halls are white, long and endless. There are unmarked doors where businesses are. Other people and creatures are walking through the halls to get to their work place. I see a big room ahead, no door but a wide archway opening to it. Some of the creatures think this is the sawdust eating room, but as we get closer, I see it is a swim pool. The water is steamy and cloudy and murky. My father and I get in and swim around. The others go to the sawdust eating room. (220 words)

["Rushing waters, against the current"] I am in a large room that is crammed full of boxes of things displayed like in a store. I see rows and stacks of boxes with shoes on them and I see dark figurines of horse's heads and so on. I need to clean this place up. I see a pile of clothes and start picking them up to put away. Several pants of pastel colors and design are on an ironing board. I haven't worn them for a long time and had forgotten I owned them. I am interested in wearing them again. Now I walk out of the room through a door out to a porch which is in a huge cavern. A river rushes through it right up to the porch. I can see the currents are strong. Even though it is dark in there. I jump into the cold river and try to swim across. But the current is too strong and sweeps me downstream. I manage to get to the side which is a rock face wall. I fight my way walking upstream against the current holding on to little handholds in the rock face. I look up stream and see that a large waterfall is at the upstream end where the water enters the cavern. Now I am in the middle of the river and walking upstream, managing to move OK even though the current is still strong. (235 words)

I am unhappy. (66 words)

["Hard to See"] I am trying to iron a dress which has wrinkles in it from being wadded up in a pile of things for too long. I sit in a regular chair with my wheelchair beside me on the left. I have trouble seeing. It's like I have a blindfold over my eyes and trouble with my right eye. I catch bits and glimpses of things but am a bit disoriented. I feel the wheelchair and try to use touch to find my way around. Lucy and Mary Sue are there. I am explaining to them about my visual problem. They listen but are a bit bored as this is common experience for them. I go outside to walk and Lucy comes with me. I can see better now and tell her there are some holes in the boards we will be walking on. We can't walk around it because just underneath on the right side is a large body of water. We must be cautious and careful with our steps. (169 words)

["Jake sings Opera"] I am in a room, dressing. Ernie comes to the door and I am only in a long sweat shirt, no undies or pants. I feel self-conscious. At least the shirt is long enough to cover my private parts. He comes in and we talk. We are going somewhere. Two men are working outside the open window. As we start to leave, I become concerned that I should lock the window so no one will come in and steal anything. I say apologetically to the men, it's not that I think you will steal anything. We go out into the hall and then drop down through a hole which is like an elevator shaft without the elevator. We land on a piece of furniture in someone's living room. I am embarrassed. They look at us. I apologize saying we thought we were going to land in a lobby or something like that. We go outside. Some woman had driven a car down this road and we were looking for her. I think she is up in a tall building with lots of windows. Now we are in another room, like a bar. Lots of people. Some of the people are doing amateur talent skits and songs. I see Jake off to the left back corner and he is playing a record or tape of classical music. He manipulates the tape with his right hand. Then he bursts into operatic song. It is kind of silly and I am impressed with his native ability. I am surprised he had the courage to do this, as he hates to make a fool of himself. I applaud and shout out Bravo! Some man on my right thinks Jake sounds silly and I am silly for applauding him. (294 words)

["Many rooms, remodel."] I am moving into a house. I am walking through the rooms to look it over. There is a great deal of work to do to make it livable. The plywood is rotting, it's old and dusty. I am amazed at how many rooms there are and how large they are. I open a boarded up window and look down to see a huge basement room, with dead leaves on the floor. Patricia and Aunt Elaine come to visit. I am showing them the house. We move now toward the front rooms of the house. Here they are in better shape. Elaine exclaims, oh, here's an other door. It's on the other side of the entry. I open it. It has some wallpaper and is very spacious. I like it. I see four doors. I open the one on the left. And find myself in a clothing retail store. A sales woman rushes over to shoo us back into my room. She follows us in. I say to her, does this other door go into the store too? She says no. I open the door that has a ramp with shallow steps built on it. I see a flight of stairs being renovated, fresh cement being laid down on the steps. I close the door, trying to lock the little flimsy lock. It keeps falling back into an open position. When I locked it, the hinges on the other side of the door pulled out a bit. Then I tried the next door. A closet. I didn't see anything in it. I didn't like how it felt to look in there. The last door is another closet. I open the door and four heavy golden brown men's overcoats fall out on the floor, just like four dead bodies. I am startled and a little afraid. I tell Elaine that this room will be for Howard and me. But I was thinking I want Howard in another room and this room is for me. Now Patricia is outside driving a VW bus. The sales woman runs to the window to look disapprovingly at her. Elaine and I go look. She is driving around in the front parking lot. (367 words)

["Princess Meets Mud Man"] I am a young Arab kind of princess. I am outside playing. My old grandfather, the King is watching. He is proud of my beauty and my energy. I have been a child and am now becoming a woman. I have long dark black hair. I turn cartwheels and run happily through the grass. Grandfather goes in to palace. I am walking back to the front door when I see in the ground a small hole. In the hole is a man's face in a pool of water. He has beautiful brown eyes. His image recedes under water as I approach. I go into the palace and ask for my Grandfather. No one responds to me. They bustle around very busy. I go toward his bedroom. I enter a room and then turn left and enter yet another room. He is there, very ill, in a white hospital bed. It is very high up and big. There is white netting all around the bed. I walk around the bed trying to find a way to get close to him. I finally command a servant to lower the bed. He does so. I hold my dying Grandfather's hand and I tell him of the mud man. We guess it is a spy from the other kingdom which wants to take over our kingdom. My grandfather decides that when he dies, he will make me queen, skipping the men of his command. He smiles at me and then dies. The men are not happy about this sudden change. (256 words)

["Multi-colored stairs and the dating game"] I am in the back of a pickup truck. Ellie is driving. She is driving very fast and I am being bumped around badly. I am in danger of being bounced out of the truck and injured. I am angry and scared. I yell at her to slow down. She pays no attention. There are two round cylinders in segments. I have my hands on them, holding them so they won't fall apart. Each segment seems to represent an amount of money. I think it was $100. Now Ellie and I are walking across some very high walkway with a metal railing. I sarcastically ask if she took this like she takes everything else. Now we are climbing down some metal structure. I look down. It is an endless drop if I fall. I several times take the wrong foothold and swing around precariously, nearly falling. Finally, I see a long endless flight of stairs with multi-colored thin stripes going vertically in the carpet. I have a hard time getting on the first step without falling. Then I am fine but it is a long way to go. Too bad the elevator is broken. As I descend the stairs, I look to my right and see lots of people seated in rows. I go into that room and they point at me and I wave at them. I don't pay any attention to them, just vacantly waving back now and again. Then I get on the stairs and continue my journey. What I didn't realize was, this was a dating game kind of situation and they were interested in me as a dating partner. And when I waved back, I was signaling OK, I'm interested too. A narrator's voice says and some of them will wait a long time for a response. (302 words)

["Floods, and saving the baby"] I am in a dingy room in a basement of an apartment house. Ellie is there and so is a baby. The baby needs something and I go to get Ellie who is sitting like she is comatose near the kitchen. I see the dishwasher and start to do the dishes. But suddenly, a whoosh of water wells up, and spills out over the floor. I am pushed out the door of the apartment by the force of the water and more is coming. I run to escape the flood. Down a long dark hall I run. I go up to another higher floor and search for people to get help. I see a door open and go into some office with odd looking phones. Two men are working there. I say I need to call for help. They vaguely notice me but don't do anything. I try to use a phone but can't figure out the complex button system. I scream at one man "You son of a bitch." I yell at the back of the other man, get the fuck out of my way. He is shocked and jumps quickly out of my way. I race back down the hall. I must return and save the baby and Ellie. I find a tiny wooden box with metal wires and pipes in it hanging on the wall. This is an elevator. Two other woman accompany me. You have to hang on with your hands on the metal pipe. But three women is too much weight and the small box speeds it's way to the basement. We hit hard, but are all right. I run back down the hall, the water increasing in depth until I get to the apartment. It's up around my thighs at that time. I force my way in and go get the baby, finding Ellie and forcing her awake. (314 words)

["Angry Archie and the Kiss"] Lucy and Archie are seated side by side. At a table. We are indoors but no architectural details. Archie is telling Lucy something that I get angry about. Perhaps he is belittling her. I tell him I don't like the way he is treating her. He is instantly furious with me and rails at me for a long time. I have no business interfering, and so on. I start to walk away, but he comes to me and steps in front of me. He then kisses me very lovingly. I respond to the sweet kiss with pleasure but I am confused about what all this means. (106 words)

["Don't Discriminate."] Charla and I are in front of a building. We are getting ready to walk to school. I can't find a paper where I'd done an outline of my homework. I ask her to help me find it in the piles of paper on the sidewalk. She's not very helpful. I look and finally find it. Now we walk up the front steps and into the house. The Casey family is having a reunion. I go into a room and see them gathered near a table. I am offered a piece of chocolate pie. I ask is there sugar in it? Then I laugh. Of course there is. Who do I think I'm talking to? It is Grandma Casey who sugars everything. I say I have to get Charla off to school and leave. I can't find Charla outside and Rochelle drives up to the building asking me where is the accessible bathroom. I tell her of three different ones on different floors and decide to walk her there. We go in and wander around but end up going out the back of the building and into a bus. I realize I'll be late for school now and get off the bus. We enter another building and have a hard time finding a ramp, which is rickety and crude. We go in and then I come out the other side. This time at the curb I have to jump down over there are a line of cats lying, relaxing. I go around them so as not to hurt them. Now I'm at the school. I enter the classroom and see the students in three circles. They are choosing who goes in what circle. I see Charla there and am relieved. I had wondered if I should return to the original building or go on to the school. I hear a snotty young teen woman say We aren't ever going to choose a granny in a wheelchair. I get righteous and say loudly that is against the ADA discrimination law. You can't do that. They don't care. They don't want anything to do with me. (354 words)

["Worthless package and a round ocean wave"] I am lying on a beach by the ocean at night. Ginny is off swimming or walking. It begins to rain and storm. I look at the ocean and am concerned that the waves are so big. They are oddly curled so that it seems the ocean is coming at me from two angles, perpendicular to each other. Like the wave is coming at me and curves around to be surrounding me. I get up, trying to move my sleeping bag and things into the house. Ginny walks up and helps me. Now I am in a house and sitting on a couch. Ernie comes over and sits beside me. He sits unusually close and I am very aware of that. It feels comfortable and yet there is tension. Now I am packing and I pick up a small pretty box with a price tag of $20.99 on it. I open it to see what is worth $20.99. I see lots of tissue paper and a small address book. I leaf through it and see where you can write birthday dates and so on. I rummage around and don't find much else. I decide this isn't worth much at all. But by now it is a big suitcase. I find a large wad of pantyhose, musty smelling in one of the compartments. (222 words)

["Spoiled miniature woman"] I am in a wheelchair. I hold a baby that is tiny and abandoned. I am comforting it. It doesn't stay well in my arms I keep adjusting it's position because it limply curls up in an awkward way. There are people in the room with me. Now the baby I took care of grew up and is a tiny miniature woman. I have her in a small cave with a window at the top so I can peek in and check how she's doing. To the small woman, it is a window to the sky that occasionally has a giant eye in it. To me it a porthole to her world. She lives alone. One day, Charlton Heston moves in. He brings her a fresh kill from the hunt. She is uppity and wants him to cook it and serve it. He plops the meat down and says. I got it for you. You will have to gut it, prepare it and cook it if you want to eat. She is angry and haughty, refusing to do anything to help. Charlton walks away from her. But a lower window is broken and a cat comes in. She is afraid and runs to hide for her life. A small orange kitten gets in too. Either I reach in and take them out, or Charlton does. The window is fixed, so she will be safe. (234 words)

["Forgot my nightgown"] I am sleeping. It is the middle of the night and I wake up, although I am still groggy. I sit up and notice that a group of family members are sitting around a campfire on the other side of camp talking. I realize I need to get up and join them. I stumble out of my bed and go there, rubbing my sleepy eyes. I am having a hard time keeping them open. Now we are going for a ride in a cousin's car. I get to drive. Michael J. Fox is my friend and sits on my left. He drapes him arm over me in friendly closeness. I am seated like I'm in the backseat, only it is the only seat and the steering wheel is there. I laugh and comment that most of the car is in the front end, but I am surrounded by my loved ones here at the back. I see the fancy set of pedals to operate the car with. It is a golden bronze color. We start to travel. I realize suddenly with a gasp that I had forgotten to pack my nightgown and maybe a few other things I need. (199 words)

["Western Penguins and my father the streaker"] I am at a festival and get a table. I decide to leave my bowl of potato salad and my three forks there as place savers. A woman tries to take my spaces but I explain I am saving them for two other people and myself. She is annoyed, but moves on. So now I am walking down a sidewalk toward the music and fun. I see a fake tavern and go in to watch the silly old west melodramas they put on there. Then I leave and walk on. I am in another structure, now with Charla. We sit. I am in my wheelchair now. We think we are sitting where the entertainment will be seen, but it turns out we are wrong. So we move to a better viewing spot. Lots of people mill around. My father comes up to me. I am delighted to see him and we hug. There is some activity outside and we look. It is a bunch of horses and then people dressed as old west penguins are getting off the horses and coming toward that tavern. I tell my father this is a melodrama. It will be fun to watch. My father gets a gleam in his eye and says playfully, I can still do that (meaning singing), as a group of old time singers are doing a barbershop quartet kind of thing, with their arm outstretched toward the audience. My father suddenly rips off his shirt and runs naked to the waist into the group and gets on bended knee to sing with them but they freeze in shock and go silent. This makes my father very conspicuous. I feel sad for him and embarrassed. I walk over toward the tavern. One of the players sees me and decides to lasso me in a hangman's noose and incorporate me into this drama. I play along. Another player joins us. We do play dialog for awhile and then just chat. I tell him I am an actress. Oh, professional? They ask. I say well, no. I used to write these scripts and.. They interrupt. I see the red head friend of Leighanne who is in commercials go by. I say I know her. As I am leaving the men, I turn and say, by the way, that was my father who joined your show. He just wanted to harmonize and have fun. But you just froze up. Too bad. They stare at me incredulously as I walk away from them. (418 words)

["Lesbian Math"] I am seated on a couch. A man and a woman are on my left. The man is sleeping at the far left. The woman is nodding off. She sits between me and the man. I decide to look at a book a woman wrote about math problems that aren't generally explained. It is a study guide. This one problem is about explaining the line that is drawn through the bottom denominator which denotes the seller. As I open the book, some of the pages tear off like pages off a notepad. I try to put them back together. I think I would be interested in learning this obscure math problem. Now a landlady of the apartments I'm in is seated on my right. She is complaining about how she and her husband have to quit the manager job because they expect them to move book cases and so on. Too hard for them with their disability. She then starts singing a silly song about lesbians. "Look them in the eye, now you have to look them in the O." She laughs. I feel a bit uncomfortable that she is talking about lesbian sex, but shrug my shoulders and enjoy the song as it is cute, the pun on eye and I. Apparently the letter O means orgasm or the vagina opening. (222 words)

["Disabled boy on my lap"] I am in a gym. Some women are at one end. A young boy in a wheelchair is near me. I ask him if he wants to sit in my lap. I am also in a wheelchair. He nods yes. He has Cerebral Palsy. I move my wheelchair close to him and see he is strapped in. I realize I will have to unstrap him and lift him into my lap as he can't do it himself. I am concerned I can't do it, but I try and am successful. He is light. I hold him in the chair and drive around. I stop in front of a mirror. We smile at seeing our reflection. Other children and women come over and stand with us and I have a camera and try to take pictures of us all in the mirror. I keep hitting the button at the wrong time but manage to get some pictures. Now the boy is a man and is seated at a counter across the gym. I drive over to talk and hit the precarious counter and some things tumble over. I apologize and we chat. I guess he likes one of the women at the other end of the gym. I ask him to tell me which one. He hesitates. I then think he is worried as his counselor I will go try to get her to like him. I assure him I will keep the information confidential and will not do anything. I am just curious to see if I guessed right which woman it is. He tells me it is the woman with black pants, dark hair and a T-shirt with writing on it. I go to see and sure enough, I was right. (292 words)

I walk down the street. I am carrying some glass art objects that are blue colored and shaped like fluted clam shells. They are very pretty. I see an art gallery and walk up the stairs to the entrance. I feel adventurous because I know Rochelle wanted to go here later and I don't want to run into her, but I think it will be fun to be here for awhile. I go in. A woman who works there comes up to me and is interested in my art objects. We walk down a wide hall to another partitioned show room. A man is selling cloth cat shaped dolls and hats.

["Monsters From Inside and Unrequited Love"] A young woman is very unhappy. She is in love and her man left her. She is distraught. A woman friend and I watch her closely, concerned she will try to kill herself in her distress. She climbs up a large tree with a full canopy, scrambling from branch to branch. I say to my friend that we should get her down from there. I grab her as she passes and pull her out of the tree. She is upset with me. I sit her down and start talking to her. I say, Now listen to me. I am a counselor and have learned a few things also in my own life. You feel that what is happening to you has only ever happened to just you. It is universal. There are three things that can happen when the inevitable happens and two people's eyes meet and they fall in love. One is that the other does not return the love and you will have unrequited love. The second is that they will love you and you do not return their love and they have unrequited love. The third is that you both fall in love and all is well. So you see, it just happens. And you figure out how to live with it. Later, I see Mabel wandering around. She comes into the room I am in not noticing that a large killing monster is around. I grab her and tell her about the danger. She doesn't seem to be concerned, like she is deaf to the reality. I and several other people are preparing to fight off the monster. I have a knife. Another has a rifle. The monster comes in. The real danger is the small entity that lives in the monster. I have to get it out of the monster and kill it before it gets us. Somehow we get the monster laid down on the floor and I use my knife to cut papers shavings to start a fire to burn it. The monster pays no attention to me. I find a lighter and start the fire. One large square eye opens then. I have the monster's attention. I try to stab it with the knife but the blade falls off the handle. I wish now I had the rifle as it is the real weapon that will work against the small entity inside. The monster now laughs at me and I see a larger more scary monster approaching me from the hall. It is the really dangerous one coming after me. I look around for the man with the rifle hoping I can get it. (442 words)

I search through the rack of clothes and can't find the one I'm supposed to wear. A woman comes over and finds the blue velvet dress. I am looking for a tape of music I might want to use, but realize that it would be a waste of time to get it now. The program is already fixed. Now I am in the dress and Bill Domhoff and Bob Van de Castle are there to examine my mind. I will go into a trance of some kind and they will analyze what is in there. They are very interested in this research. After they examined me, I suddenly jump into a swimming pool. In the pool is a small swimming white speckled bird, sort of like a penguin in shape. It is swimming around the edges of the pool. I twirl around, dress and all, and swim with him. Bill watches as I'm still in my trance state. The bird goes underwater and I follow. It is fun and the bird and I watch each other in a friendly way. We playfully swim together. (207 words)

["Outer Space and Quiet love"] I am a part of a team that is flying to another planet to either spy on or help them with a new energy system. The leader is a nice man like Glenn F. We are in a spaceship. We arrive at a planet and go to the university. Several young women are with us as volunteers to the project. They want to go get some lunch. I say there are lots of places to eat, but you have to pay for your own food. This upsets one woman, with dark hair. She thinks the project should pay for their entire way. I say that would be too expensive. I walk with them down a hall to a cafeteria area. Glenn comes up to me and we talk. We are going to find the leader of the planet and get or give information on this dynamic energy system. Then Glenn gently kisses me, almost like a accident. I am a bit surprised., but enjoy it. We chat and he kisses me again. I wonder if he is just being friendly or if he is attracted to me. I hope he is attracted to me because I really like him. Now he sits on a couch. Another man is already seated there. It is a three cushion couch and I go over to sit near Glenn. I ask the other man to scoot over and make room for me. He grumbles and says that would require him to get up and go change clothes. I look at him, waiting. He sighs and gets up. I sit close to Glenn. He kisses me again, this time with more lingering feeling. It is gentle and sweet. Now he is going to walk me home. I am now in my wheelchair and we chat as we walk down the hall. We come to the door of my apartment. He has some studying to do and so he comes in to lay on my couch and study. At the door, I get up out of my wheelchair and walk in. I am trying to show him that I can walk like an able-bodied person and maybe he'll find me more attractive. My daughter Ellie is there and she quickly sees that he and I want to be alone. She excuses herself to the other room. I walk over to the couch and sit next to him. I ask him if he's a fast reader or a slow reader. I am trying to help him study better. I seem to think he has a learning disability and is a bit slow with school work, although he is an intelligent person. He says he has some trouble but not much. Now it's time for him to go. I walk him out the door and down the hall. We pause and say goodbye. I turn and walk back to my apartment door. He calls to me and comes back. He then says will I go see a movie with him on Sunday. I smile, and inwardly I feel very happy and excited. I say yes, I'd like that. He smiles, walks away and I close the door, and hear him shout All Right!! Which is what I am inwardly shouting myself. I am very happy. (547 words)

["Back at work"] I am back at work in the counseling department. Mabel hands me a small cup of water and tells me to take it to Jason for his son. I am walking through the halls looking for the room. I walk a long way and feel very tired. I decide to take a short cut. I go to a wall that has a small broken hole in it. Several disabled people are seated nearby. They are sitting quietly, resigned. I see the hole is too small for me and particularly for my purse. I am very frustrated because this means I will have to walk the long way around. I say out loud, I hate being disabled. I feel bad then because of the other disabled people there. I continue walking. I am now walking down a long hall in the basement floor. I see my co-worker Jerry walking with a bad limp. He hurries past me. Then he comes back and walks with me to help me find my way. I finally arrive at a long table where the counselors are seated in a row. I walk to Jason's place and hand him the cup of water, which is now partly empty because some spilled. Now I look up to the ceiling and see a grate. Through the grate I see a group of the counselors seated in their lounge area. Hank is talking. He is looking down where I am and commenting that he didn't realize that the two rooms could see and hear each other. He is surprised. The counselors used to have this room. And the students were in the above room. (275 words)

["Blue Piano and a woman dying"] I am knitting a sweater. I have the right half of it done and most of the shawl back. I am running out of yarn. I am in a house. Suddenly, my yarn is pulled into another room. I follow it and tell Ernie that I think the woman I am knitting this sweater for is telling me I don't have to finish it. I want to finish it though. I think the woman is dying and I want to do this for her. I go to a corner where I am looking for another yarn skein. I see a bright red one. The sweater is a pale blue. Or gray. I put the right side on and see it fits perfectly, the hem right at the top of my waist. Now I am in another room and a woman in a blue bathrobe is sitting. She is dying. Her mother and her brother sit on her left. They are holding her hand and being supportive and sympathetic and sad. I hold her right hand. Another woman is at my right watching and also sympathetic to the dying woman. Her hand is square and blunt. Her arms thin and angular. I feel very sad she is dying. She strokes my hand. She is seated in front of a tiny blue piano, a very small baby grand piano. I admire it and wonder if maybe she would give it to me when she dies. It would fit in my tiny house pretty well. Then I feel guilty for having such material thoughts when she is dying. How selfish of me. (269 words)

["War and Uncle Gus the Vulture"] I am in a house, maybe Aunt Esther's. It is a resort I am visiting. War broke out and it is time to pack up and leave. I think at first that I will only take essential things but as I look around I see many things I had brought that I don't want to leave behind. Knick knacks, pretty boxes and so on. I begin to gather them up and pack them. I wish I hadn't brought so much stuff. I remember that a young man who is now at war left his quartz crystal in my keeping. I go to the hutch to get it. I see several small ones. I'm not sure which one is his. I take several just in case, also aware that they aren't mine, but I kind of like them. I feel a bit guilty. I put them in a small pink pouch with a drawstring top. I work hard at keeping that pouch close by and not getting packed under lots of things. It is important to deliver it to the man. I realize I don't know where my clothes are an call out for help. I am agitated. A woman, a younger version of my mother comes over and says calm down. She will help me. We walk to the cabin we'd been staying in. By now most people have packed and fled. There are rows of black purses left behind in the rush. I look at them and say none are mine. My mother likes one of them with a lacy pattern and suggests we take it. I say no. It's not ours. I see Boomer and pick him up to take him with us. He struggles and tries to get away. I hold tight. My mother sees a pair of pajamas for a toddler. She takes it because she likes it and puts Fluffy in it to carry her like a baby. We walk back to the house. I go in and see photos laying on a table. I wonder if they were left out for me to take. They are photos of Abner, Darcy and me in a coastal town that I know. I look around and see a cousin, perhaps Dora. I ask her if I am supposed to take these. She hesitates and then says no. I don't think so. I look at each one. I see a series of picture of Darcy posing as a young girl in pretty clothes, black and lacy, which show off her budding womanly figure. I see a photo of Uncle Gus as a young man. He is handsome. Then I see a photo of him older and walking. It is a side view and I notice that his neck is crooked and shaped like a Vulture's neck. I wonder if he is alive. I should talk to him. Now I leave the house. I get into a jeep and drive up a steep mud road. It is hard going and I think that soon it will be flat and paved and I will have an easier time. I look forward to that. But I turn a corner and am in the hall with the wall blocking the road. I am stuck. Then I am in a field. Shooting is going on and I crouch, my back protected by a fallen log. I am scared and hope I don't get hit with bullets. The battle is pretty intense. I get into a deep pond with a moose and the two of us stand there, covered by the water, hiding from the war.

["Volcanos"] I am looking at an image on a wall. It is a volcano erupting on the East Coast. Near New York City. I watch as the melting lava area gets larger and larger. I realize New York City has been totally covered and it is still getting bigger. Now it is clear that the entire world will be covered. I see the land all barren and rocky. No vegetation, nothing. I am aware that only a few people survived this catastrophe. They live in rocky caves. Now I look in front of me and see a huge long phallic looking outcropping of rock which is the core plug from the original site of the eruption. A woman is in a hot air balloon floating above it. She, another woman and a man are descending down the ropes to explore this rock. They precariously go down the ropes looking like they could fall to their death at any moment. The rock is surrounded by a deep open abyss. Now the woman looks past me. I turn and look and see a rooster. I am surprised and glad to see there are animals left. I then see two nanny goats. The woman wonders and hopes there is a male goat as well. I see a quail. There is hope for survival on this decimated planet. (223 words)

["Disfigured face and cheating"] I am at some program the children are putting on. There is a series of different skits. It is finished and I am walking to a table to get some lunch. A woman teacher sits on the right. I see several empty spots and reach for a chair. Gordon is headed for the same chair and there is some confusion. I finally ask him if he is going to be sitting there. I then sit down. The woman is watching me closely. Someone says don't leave your purse on that shelf, lined up with the rest. It's an easy mark and someone will steal it. I put my purse there anyway, as I don't believe there is a danger. Now, Mary Sue and I are standing somewhere and she has a disfigured face with many scars. I am telling her not to be so embarrassed and sensitive about it. People get used to things and they don't bother them after awhile. I tell her that people got used to her blindness, why is this different? She insists that this is different. She remains in hiding. Now I am seated at a table with Mary Sue and Lucy. That same woman is watching us closely. Lucy has to fill out a quiz about the program we saw earlier. She can't remember the sequence of the skits and asks me to fill it out for her. I start to and then become very aware of the woman watching. I realize I am helping Lucy cheat. I stop and say no. I can't do this. This is cheating. Somewhere in this dream, I see a small golden and white kitten seated on a blanket with a pile of clothes. (286 words)

["Aliens and Capt. Picard"] I am in an old run down apartment building. I walk fearfully into my bedroom. There are weird little metallic spiders. Capt. Picard comes in to examine them. He has a detector machine and we hear the things humming a high pitched sound. They gather up in a swarm and come at us. We run. They are aliens and are going to attack us. We get into an elevator. One of the aliens gets in and is plump and white like a small puppy. It tried to sting me. I grasp it and fight it off, throwing it to the floor. One goes for Capt. Picard. We struggle but they win and overcome us. Now we are on their planet, held prisoners. We must escape. I run down old dilapidated halls. They follow. Now one of them looks like a German soldier. He throws me to the ground and lies on top of me to rape me. I push him off and grab him by his toes and drag him down the hall. I see a sign on the wall saying Gender Toes. It means their sexual organs are in their toes. I release him and run to the elevator to escape with the others. I get in, he chases after me, I slam the door. He forces it open. I hit him forcefully. He falls and I escape, just barely. (231 words)

["Love Blooms and I am healing."] I am at a conference with the other counselors from work. Tyler is seated near me. We chat. I am rooming with Phyllis. We are going to cross the street to wade in the ocean. As we start to cross, cars race past nearly hitting us. Phyllis is scared and refuses to try and cross the street again. I look to my right and see two curved streets coming into our street. I step forward out into the street to see more clearly. I see a clearing and run across the street calling to Phyllis to follow. She does. We get to the sand and walk to the ocean edge. I see large chunks of broken ice floating in the water. I am surprised. That will be cold!! We walk along the edge. Then I look again and see that there is a long series of shower curtains pulled closed at the water's edge. We can't see the ocean. Now I return to the conference. Time to do some sort of project. I take a poem of mine to share. I try to etch it on glass. It is not working right. I try to find the room in the basement where this meeting is being held and I am getting lost. I finally find it. Now, I am in a house. It is big with lots of rooms. I have returned from the conference with the counselors. I am unpacking. Cherie is there to help. I see that my bookcase is still gone and a few other things. They aren't put back from unpacking. I walk out to the living room from my bedroom (which has glass French doors). I am glad to be home. Apparently my mother isn't back from work yet. The place is quiet. I like that. I walk into the kitchen. Now I see my mother driving into the house. I wonder how she managed that. I guess she made the front door accessible for the car. She stops at the door to the next room and pushes an automatic door opener button. The door opens and she drives through. I don't remember having that before. Jerome comes in. He is friendly and chatting about the conference we were at. I am surprised but pleased he is so friendly. We laugh about some amusing incidents at the conference. He asks to see my project pictures from the conference. I go to a loft area and jump up there to get the pictures. With great ease, I get back down by holding on to the edge with my hands and easily letting myself down with only a short drop to the floor. I am surprised and happy to see I can do this. I walk, noticing how comfortable it is. I am in the kitchen with Jerome leaning on the counter. I show him the pictures. He touches me in a supporting friendly way, his hand on my arm or shoulder. I enjoy this. He likes the pictures and we continue talking. I see a large dark horse walking through the house. Jerome opens the refrigerator to find ice cream. He hands me a gallon container with multi colored ice cream called "something Mateo." He gets another container out and we eat right out of the containers laughing and talking. I feel very happy. I share with him some stories from the conference, things that happened, like when Phyllis and I tried to cross the street and the cars kept racing by. He is kind and supportive, more frequently standing very close to me and touching me in a friendly way. It is pleasurable. He sits on the floor and I slide down the wall and sit with him, commenting that it feels wonderful to be able to do this again. I tell him that lately I've been feeling better and stronger. I see my reflection in a glass and I see my hands. I rub them together. I say I sure hope this means I'm healing. But I've been here before. We'll see. He smiles at me. Now I see the dark horse again. Jerome and I decide I will ride him. Jerome helps me get on his bare back. We walk to the front door. As the horse is walking down the steps I slide up his neck precariously. Jerome steadies me and tells me to sit back near his back shoulders. I do and it is now comfortable and safe. We walk through a field where I see two tractors with hay mowing attachments racing each other. Jerome hops on the back of the horse behind me. It feels very good to have his arms around me, holding me securely. I am aware that we are sexually attracted to each other. I am also aware he is married. We ride for awhile. Then we get off the horse and kiss. It is sexually exciting. He pulls back, saying. I can't. My wife. I say I know. You have to leave. We kiss one more time. (842 words)

["Beautiful Music Becomes A Chore"] Whoopie Goldberg has wonderful musical talent. She plays a piano piece and impresses this group of people searching for the best piano players. She plays a piece and the judges in the next room behind the observation window count each note for duration and intensity. She is very good. They want her to do more and then more and then more. She sits at the piano in a tiny room and plays piece after piece. Then the people take this and sell it or do something with it to their advantage. The music is beautiful. After a long time, she grows weary of being constantly working and not getting appreciated. The people keep insisting she continue. She rebels and leaves. She finds a tiny apartment and sits in there looking out the window. She sees a cat and a dog, possibly hers. She throws a steak down to the sidewalk for them to eat. Then she decides to take her precious jewelry (three necklaces of black hematite pearls) to throw away into a river. She walks to the river, looking for a place where she can throw the necklaces away. But the sandy bank is long and the water out of throwing distance. A man playing a baseball game in the nearby field sees her. He seems to understand what she wants to do. He walks over to her and leads her to a rail where you can drop things down into a man's booth. If the stone or gem lands in a bowl of similar gems, you get more. He drops a pretty amethyst gem into a bowl and gets some back. She tries it too and succeeds as well. (281 words)

["Landslides"] I am at some performance area, like an outdoor stadium built into the hillside. I am looking for an aisle I can walk up. But each aisle is crowded with people. I finally find one at the end and walk up it. Now at the top I am walking across mountainous terrain. Suddenly, a landslide slide starts under my feet and I scramble hard to move off it without falling. Each time I get to a more secure footing, a new landslide would start. I scramble hard until I reach the edge where it is more secure. (97 words)

["Shaky Ponds And Love"] I am walking with my sister Lydia, my brothers Dwight and Jake. Another man, perhaps a distant cousin, named James is with us. We are looking at many tables and booths where people are selling jewelry and other items. Someone is dragging a long white sheet. I lie down on the sheet, thinking it is funny. Dwight is upset, and says get off the sheet. There are hites on the sheet, and they will hurt you. They will bite you. I laugh, not too worried, but I do get up and walk. We go up and down many levels, looking at all the things on the tables. I decide I want a long beautiful crystal necklace. I turn back and walk to those tables. A short round man follows me. He professes his love to me. I keep walking. I looked to my left. I see a large pond. It is shaking and the water is very active. I say oh, No. Do we have to cross this pond again? As we continue walking, I see that we can walk around it. And now James has decided he loves me. He calls a friend over, to witness his proposal of marriage. He holds his arms out to me, and I walked to him to hug him. We are going to be married. The other man has found another woman and they love each other. (234 words)

["Church In Basement, Machine Guns"] I am in a friend's house. She is very ill. Someone is after her. I am trying to help her. I walk carefully out the front door with a gun. I threaten the people to back off. They are trying to find a special treasure. I see a mud puddle by a door to another part of the house. I feel in the water for the treasure. The water slowly drains away. I see some ceramic figures in the muddy bottom, but not the special treasure. I now see a door to a church in the basement of the house. I am looking down a long distance. A woman from the church looks up at me and I signal her. She nods and goes to another room and returns with the golden treasure. An urn. I nod again and she takes it back to the safe it was kept in. I jump down into the church. The people are after me and I run through the halls. I see church women, friends of my friend, who are happy to see me here again. I peek into a couple of rooms to see other women doing classes and so on. I get to the room next to the safe. A group of people are seated in a circle. I run in. The bad people are shooting and the seated people scatter, running for safety. The room is now an open field next to the large building. One machine gun is up on a high wall and shooting. I see one woman walking into the dangerous area. I notice it is Monica Lewinsky. I wonder if we'll see Bill Clinton next. The machine gun chatter keeps getting stronger and faster. I look again from my hiding place and see a long series of garbage cans stretched out with perhaps 5 or 6 machine guns in a circle at the end. A gatlin gun. It is spewing bullets all over and is now moving toward me. (333 words)

["Marijuana and Radio Interference"] I am in a house. A group of women are here to do some project. I am clearing off the dining table. My baby is sitting quietly in a high chair near me. I take a sponge and wipe off lots of crumbs. I'm a bit embarrassed there is so much of a mess. I am in a hurry, so the women don't notice. The plastic tablecloth is actually two of them with different prints sort of stuck together. It doesn't look good. I am quickly thinking if I have any glue or stuff the women will need for the scrap books they are making. I look over to the baby and she is nearly buried under cloth and stuff from the clean up. I feel bad. I tell Ellie, sitting nearby, to put her to bed. I realize it is 9 pm and she should have been in bed sooner. I feel guilty. Ellie is annoyed I asked her to do this. I glare at her and insist. She leaves with the baby. Now the secretary of state, a woman, enters the room. Some woman is announcing her arrival and how this is related to the use of marijuana as a medicinal plant. I realize they had planted some marijuana in our back yard for this evening's event. We are to get stoned before we do the project. I run out the back door to the garden. I see a man pulling up a marijuana plant by the roots and walking away with it. I see green beans thick on the vines. I go back in to confront the women. I tell them I am upset they would plant marijuana in my parents garden without consulting us. They laugh and say it's not a problem, because the law says you can for medicinal purposes. There's only a small chance of being arrested. I feel silly for making such a fuss, but feel compelled to continue. I half-heartedly explain how upset I am. (333 words)

["Pleasant Ghosts"] I am in a house. Apparently, I bought it. My relatives are helping me move in. Uncle Lionel comes in the back door with some things. I say, put them in the refrigerator. He goes to a side room I have not explored yet. I say, no, not that room. The kitchen. I then go into the room to see what's in there. There is a second room beyond that one. I look around, pleasantly surprised to see old beautiful curio cabinets, with dark woods and curved glass. Two of the smaller cabinets are crooked. I see a small window that looks into my bedroom. Near it is a picture of some old man, maybe the old gentleman who used to own this house. He is long dead. As I look at the picture, it becomes animated. He smiles at me. We talk. I go into yet another room between my bedroom, where I can see my unmade bed, and the room with the picture. Lots of interesting things are in there. I see this room opens into yet another series of rooms. I start to walk toward the door but hear someone peeing and realize the old man is using the toilet there. I turn and walk back into the curio room. I see another picture where a series of faces appear. Ugly old fat men, one of whom has an open ulcerated sore on his face. These are the old friends of the old man. They are chatting about how when his wife died, he was.. At that point, the old man comes in and they shut up. We all pretend we weren't talking about him.

["Grade A Papers"] I am attending a conference. A large crowd is in a large room. As I come in, the star of the entertainment Buddy C., a comedian, takes my purse. Someone else takes my wallet to put somewhere for safe keeping. This seems quite normal. I feel fine about it. I sit on the ground. I look high up at a balcony where we are watching a news reporter and Buddy C. doing a comedy routine of funny faces and pauses. I am surprised old sober sides the reporter can be funny. He hams it up. Now it is time to leave. I ask a man, like Charles of the conference in California, if I may borrow his car. He happily agrees. I walk around a graveled hill to the gas station parking lot. I get into his fancy black car and drive. I am conscious of being very careful so I don't hurt the car. I feel responsible. I return to the same spot and get out of the car. I clean up my piles of papers from the conference. I see several of my reports I wrote at the conference. One has a big red "A" on it. I say to a woman friend Last year I didn't even turn in a report. The year before that I got a boring "b" minus. I am very proud of my important "A" grade. I pick up many small scraps of paper I had made cutouts with. I want to return the car in good condition. (255 words)

["Buddy Guy And I"] I am in an auditorium. There is a music concert of blues there. The seats are like theatre seats, raked up. I am seated up toward the top. I am looking down at the performance area, watching the two black men playing their guitars and singing the blues. They are good. One comes up the aisle still playing his guitar. It is Buddy Guy. He sees me and smiles. He nods at me, inviting me to walk with him and dance. We slide down the row of theatre seats in a gliding dancing motion. It is great fun. We are in rhythm and enjoying this together. We dance back up the aisle. Now we are close together, attracted and feeling warm and loving. I tell him he is being discounted and not used up to his potential by these other people who are more interested in their own egos. He sees it my way and we decide to break off from the music group he was with and go out on our own. (173 words)

["God Chooses Me"] I am in a huge mansion on the edge of a high cliff that drops straight down to the ocean. I feel a small shake of an earthquake. For awhile, there are only occasional small shakes, but it builds up to a nasty earthquake. I look out the window worried the house will fall off the cliff and smash into the ocean. I hear a huge crash and see that a big wave came up and broke the window on the other wall. I decide it is time to pack and leave. I think about what I should pack. What is most essential. I get my pills. Then I remember my writing and pack some of that. I find some clothes on the floor and my toothbrush. I am fairly calm and moving slowly even though the earthquake continues. Now I look up at the ceiling in time to see a tidal wave entirely engulf the house. Now I am scared and hurry. Howard comes in. We say hi and I continue rushing to pack. He leaves. Suddenly I look out the window on the ocean side again and see a tall dark figure floating toward me. It has black plastic armor on and a long black lance. The pointed end of it is coming straight at me. I realize this is God and he is choosing me for something. Now I realize I have been chosen to coordinate the writers. I gather up the empty writing books to give to the writers as they arrive. They slowly trickle in. I give each one their book. I pick up a letter Howard sent me. It begins with the word "Honey." He describes the new building he moved into. Brick with marking of circles and squares on each window. An old high school friend comes in. I find his old high school writing book and give it to him. I say he can choose to finish the stuff he started, or write new stuff. We chat about the days when we were in a writing group together. He said collaboration with me was really good. The other group member, Mary was OK, but not like we were together as a writing team. (371 words)

I point out I didn't get any. She says the other woman asked first. I wait, hoping as it passes by, I can get some. Then I am distracted by some project we are doing, involving wrapping a yarn around a stick and covering it loop by loop. I am wrapping the stick and listening to the woman speaker at the front of the room. I manage to make a mess. Then I notice I'm not doing it right. I had started it one way and now I'm doing it another way. I lay it down on the floor. The meeting is over and I get up to go. I leave the stuff on the floor and see the other woman cleaning up after me. I feel bad, but I don't do anything about it. (170 words)

["Heart Attack"] I live in a large building downtown. I go outside and talk to two women who are going to do some work for me, but I haven't been doing the work I need to do, before they can do their work. I tell them I'll get right to it. I don't really want to, but I feel obligated to say that. They are both sitting in rocking chairs. They know I don't really mean what I said.

["Seth And The Kitten"] I am walking through a long old building that is a series of rooms like in a museum. Each room has a special book collection from different countries and from ancient ages. I enter the Tibetan Book Of The Dead room and am very excited to see this exhibit. I see a Japanese room and look at the book covers which look like an old dream journal book of mine. I also see some books with a purple swirl pattern. I am now in a large room with some other women. A man comes to the door, from the prince. I am invited somewhere. I can't find my kitten and am sad. I am called outside where I see some kittens, including the cute fuzzy gray one that is mine. I am told to call to it. Someone is calling "Here Kitty, here kitty." I say to the cat, "Pasele" I explain it is important to just let the kitty come as it wishes, giving it encouragement, not demands. It comes to me and I pick it up, cuddling it happily. Now I am in another room with Seth, Mary Ann and Katrina and several other women. Seth is very antsy and keeps hitting my chair and annoying me. He bumps me so hard I hit my knee on a corner, hurting myself. I automatically turn around and slap him on his head. Then I hold his head, rubbing the hurt place and trying to explain to him how much he hurt me. Mary Ann is very upset with me. I feel ashamed and guilty. I wish I hadn't lashed out so automatically.

["Walking and Losing The Crowd"] I decide I will walk on a long hike with a group of people. My Aunt Naomi, Aunt Charlotte and Bonnie are also on this hike. It seems to be all women. My Aunt Charlotte saves a place for me near the front of the line. We begin the hike. I walk around and come back to the line and can't find Aunt Charlotte. I ask Aunt Naomi where she is. She says Aunt Charlotte decided not to come on the hike. I am a bit upset, as it was she who promised to save me a space up front. I feel badly about cutting in line. I realize I need to go pee. I leave the line in search of a bathroom. I find one. The door opening is odd. The toilet is directly in the doorway, facing into the little bathroom. In order to shut the door, I pull a small segment of the door over the toilet and then shut a second segment of the door with straps on it. I think about just leaving it open, but decide to go to the extra work of closing it. I then pee. A woman from the group comes in and angrily tells me I wasn't supposed to leave the group. I'm in trouble now. I now go back to join the group. They are gone and I don't know which way they went. I feel nervous about finding them. I feel upset that I am walking for such long distances. I don't know if I'll make it. I feel tired already. The hike seems too long for me to manage. I see a woman and ask her where the group went. She says they went to the Shanghai District of the city. I am surprised because that is such a short distance away. I realize they are taking it easy the first day to help us build up endurance and strength to make it the whole journey. (329 words)

["Flying Dolphins Cathedral Grapes"] I am in a house. I think my brother Dwight lives there also. I notice it is raining very hard. I walk over to a window to see the downpour when I am suddenly aware of the courtyard and how beautiful it is. A canopy of grape vines like a cathedral ceiling. I look to see if there are grapes. Big nice ones, some so big they look like electric light bulbs. What abundance I had with me and I never noticed before. Then I look higher to see two transparent glass like dolphins leaping and arching over the top of this grape vine structure. They are so graceful and beautiful. I go back into the house. A woman stands right in front of me and opens her dress completely like it was a robe. I stare at her naked fat body and then turn my eyes away. I am repulsed by her fatness. She is grinning at me. Then she has underwear on. She closes her dress and is inspecting all the things in the house. Some General is around and wants to know. I show her Dwight's room. I am uppity and joke around about being a spy. I don't like their attitudes. Now a young man is talking to Dwight who is soaking in a pool.

["Falling over Ellie"] I am in a house. I am expecting three women to visit. And later, the Judge will be here and I need to teach him something. The women arrive, but the one I need there isn't there. So I leave them in the living room and I begin to clean up the other rooms. I pick up some toys a child left on the floor. And so on, trying to clear the entry way so the women can leave without seeing a mess. Now the meeting is over and the women come out one at a time and I guide them out. I ask the last woman what was decided in the meeting. She paused and couldn't remember very well. She finally said we didn't decide anything we just talked. I felt a bit embarrassed thinking I should have stayed with them as a hostess, and not be off cleaning. The woman comments on the spots of pink on the ceiling which I was trying to clean off. She says how clever to have spots of color in the recessed areas. I say sure, It's called Bas Relief. I am pretending to be very artsy about it, to cover up my shame about being messy. I then point out the bare wall in the other room and say soon I will have cabinets and bookcases there. It will look very nice. I stumble over a laundry basket of clothes and fall into it. The woman leaves, not too impressed. Now Ellie comes in, and I am picking things up. She tries to help and we both reach for a large stuffed animal. We collide and I fall again into the clothes basket. I get up throw a pile of clothes into a closet and shut the door. Ellie isn't too helpful, mostly in the way. Now I am at a lake shore. My father, who looks like a young Uncle Joel is going to teach the Judge how to row in a rowing boat, professionally. I am there and as he explains I try to show the right way. I pull back on two rowing arms. I see the lake. The waves are high. Someone says we'd better not practice today, the lake is too dangerous. We all agree. (379 words)

We are in the main church area and I ask a woman if the candy has been passed out yet to the congregation. She says yes. I ask, what about the taffy? She says yes to that also. Now I am a bit worried because that took up some time and I wonder if I'll have enough presentation for the time allotted. I hear the woman announcer say the name of this play is "Women And Cancer." I am surprised because the play is about pioneer women and raising their children. We begin the play. I open a large diaper bag that is very colorful and empty. I try to stand it up but it keeps falling over. I keep readjusting it. I do a monologue about pioneer women and children. It seems a long speech. (154 words)

The nice pastor of the church comes over to where I sit in my wheelchair. He asks me what I think. I say It's wonderful. The men now understand that if they don't change, we, the women, won't want them. And they are changing now. I have hope for the first time in years that I will find relationship. I am smiling, feeling excited. I watch as the church organist is playing a hymn. The pastor is trying to get her attention to ask her to get something from the office. The halo flys to hover over her head. Someone picks it up and moves it to a spot over another person's head. It zips back as if a magnent. This happens three or four times. I stand up and say to the wondering congregation, I notice that while we are arguing over whether this is religious or scientific (secular) it keeps coming back and forth to each one. It appears over a seated man's head in the back of the congregation and the man disappears. A beautiful angel appears on the back wall of the church. I ask it to take me and suddenly I am flying through the air being pulled by some strong magnetic like force. I am trying to speak to the congregation about my experience as I am being drawn to the angel. I say I am scared and yet excited. I am sucked to the angel image and meld with it. My arms are stretched out llike the angel's wings. I am being blended and disappearing into the angel. (292 words)

["Fire!!"] I am with a group of people who somehow time travel and drop into a battle. At the moment we drop in, we are making shooting noises. At that same moment the real soldiers are shooting. So we are not noticed. Now, I am watching as a general (sort of Sean Connery) is sleeping in his tent. The enemy sneak up and light small fires in the corners of the tent. The fires smolder. The general doesn't notice. A woman and a man come to the tent and see the fires. They want to warn the general so he can escape with his life. But instead, the woman, in an attempt to help the General, pour gasoline on the fires to get them to flame up big. Her thinking is to make the situation so bad that the General will notice the danger and escape. He does escape. (148 words)

["Sex In A Closet"] I am in my wheelchair. It is after dinner and Paulina's "husband" nods to her, indicating he's ready to have sex. He and Paulina and I go into a closet like room. I am supposed to be there while they have sex. I busy myself looking at things in a cluttered box of junk. I see a glimpse of his briefs as I try not to observe. He is standing up as she is spread eagle on the table. I feel very uncomfortable and remind myself to ask Paulina if it's all right if I don't attend these after dinner quickies. I see syringe needles from Fluffy's shots, some Xmas cards, one from a cousin, perhaps Darcy, Deirdre or Beverly to Charla. Charla never responds to her. I am throwing away the old cards. I decide to dump the whole box, but I see 3 necklaces. Jade marbles with dragon claws on them. I decide to keep them. Jake asks if I should ask Rigo to help me with my dream software since Ricardo isn't being helpful. I laugh and say with strong sarcasm, Goodness No. Rigo is an idiot with computers and will really mess it up. Now Paulina's "husband" is done. I'm surprised it's so quick. Paulina sure didn't get any pleasure. He's dressed again, wearing a black pants, black vest and pink shirt with a ruffle on it. He sighs contentedly like he's had a good meal and pats his tummy (244 words)

["Betrayal and Contradiction"] I am a guest of an Asian woman and her family. I am seeking a job as a school principle. I walk to the school. I walk across a raised wooden platform sidewalk.

I lose the job and sadly walk back to the woman's house. She is making a bed. I help her smooth out the sheets. I realize I am working harder here helping her than if I'd stayed home. I feel tired. A man, balding, with long scraggly hair. He's overweight and not good looking. He wants to date me. I turn him down, packing to go home, feeling betrayed. I can't understand how "Derek" could have betrayed me. I look out a wall of windows and see him coming toward me. He hesitates, looking at me questioningly. I hesitate and then smile at him. He then comes in and I kiss him on the cheek. We talk. Then as we talk I realize this is not ok and I walk back across the wooden platform to the school. He comes with me. I tell him I don't really want this job. I am a valley girl. I don't like M City. Too isolating. No one here I'd want to have a relationship with. Then I tell him I didn't like what he did to me and I'm taking the job. He pulls out a large pistol (silver) and we struggle over it. Sometimes he's trying to kill me. Sometimes he's trying to kill himself. I get the gun from him. The other man that is attracted to me is here as well, watching me, wanting to be with me. (303 words)

["Servant And Love"] I am a servant in a rich home in the 19th century. My job is to take care of the young girl, who is like Charla. The girl is very difficult to manage. She is angry and violent, striking out at me, trying to hurt me. I carry her in my arms as she struggles against me. She grabs at my mouth with her hand trying to pull and rip at my lips and teeth. I try to pull back my head to prevent her from hurting me. I carry her into the house. Then I come back outside alone for a few minutes of rest in this difficult day. I need to go back into the house and can't remember which door is the correct one, there so many along the side of the house. I find it and go in. Now I am seated for a few quiet moments in a large library room, two wing backed chairs, and walls lined with bookshelves full of books. I become aware of a man approaching the house. I go out to greet him. He is a stranger to me, but we are attracted to each other. I am showing him the house. The other servants sneer at me and make belittling comments to me as we pass them. The man continues to be attracted to me. We are standing in the center of a large round table with the middle open. Suddenly he is lying on top of me and it is sexually exciting. I feel his hard penis against my vagina through all the clothes. I like it. But I make him stop because I am afraid people will see us. (282 words)

This is fun and yet I don't want to drown by being knocked over by big waves. We are laughing and talking. He hugs me and pulls me closer to him. It is a very pleasant sensuous feeling. I think it is very intimate. Our full bodies are touching and I love the good feeling. We want to make love. We are in love. It is a very happy feeling. He then wades off to the right, near a deeper place with cold fast currents. I am afraid for him. He gets caught in the currents and is pulled under. I go near the dangerous area worried for him.

I try to get the towels pulled up above the water. They help me. They invite me to pour in a few drops of scented lotions. A floating device is a waterproof light bulb. I pick it up and examine it. I am trying to turn it on. There are two small bulbs, one white, the other yellow. An elder man of the tribe gives me a small handmade book. I open it. It is handwritten. It is bound in beautiful buckskin. He made it himself. I am touched and impressed he wrote an important story for me by hand. Now the bath is over and I am dressed, in another room. A young native american woman is talking about how she loves chinese things. I see she is wearing black and red clothes with chinese designs. I tell myself to remember to buy her a gift of something chinese. Bonnie comes in. We are chatting about a trip we once planned on taking. I speak in spanish.

["Small Room In Space"] I enter a space ship which looks like a small square room with a door to a small bathroom. The walls are all white. Little or no furniture or decorations. Several other people and myself are seated, waiting for lift off. Then, we get up and go into the actual command part of the ship. It is cold, with fog drifting around and a bit scary. We go to our stations and drive the ship off into space. We are there for a long time. I see a piece of wooden cabinet and I burst into tears, touching it because it's been so long since I have been around normal things and not just metal and space. We travel on. Now there is a huge alien space ship above us and our small ship is caught in the turbulent currents. We are tossed around violently. The aliens come on board. They had been to earth and either transformed earthlings into them or became like earthlings. They look us over and decide we aren't much of a threat. They leave. I remember seeing swirling purple colors when the huge ship was above us. (192 words)

The birds are the size of ostriges without the long legs. Emus, maybe. Charla tries to get the baby out from under its mommy. It doesn't want to come. So I act as a distraction to get the mommy busy elsewhere. Charla captures the baby. I carry it on my left shoulder. It doesn't fight, rather it cuddles up in my neck and enjoys the comfort of being close. We see several display cases with bird cages and bird food in them. I check prices and am surprised and not unhappy about how much things cost. I check another case. A metal bird cage costs 51 dollars. That's the cheapest one. I return to the first case where I originally had thought it was too expensive glad to see it costs less than the second case of things. We get a package with cage and food. (180 words)

["Three Brides For Election"] I am in a milling crowd of politicians up for election. I am one of them and am wearing a baize lacy tablecloth folded into a wrap around skirt. I look around to see that two other women candidates also have the same lacy tablecloths. One has two. One for the top and another for the skirt. Yet another woman has three of them. We look like brides, with a Spanish mantilla look. I am now the one with three tablecloths on. I pull off the one at the bottom of the skirt that is like a train. I modify the skirt as there is a gap showing. I reset the hooks closer so the gap is closed. It feels ridiculous to have us all looking the same. (128 words)

Suddenly I realize that I can't see or hear the play from this corner because we are several blocks away from the presentation. I get up and walk rapidly toward the outdoor theatre. The other authors follow me. I am nearly running when I wonder if I can manage this. I am out of breath. I finally arrive only to see the play is finished. I hear the applause which sounds warm and loud. I ask a man seated on my right if it is only intermission, or is it the end. He said it was the end. I am disappointed. I ask him what he thought of the play. He said there were too many characters. 14 of them. He couldn't keep track of them all and the plot was too involved and he got confused. I don't feel good about his negative critique. I must be a poor writer. (184 words)

But Ginny is taking so long. I finally do go outside. I hear Ginny coming to the garage door saying "Set A, Set B, Set C" She is counting the keys in key sets to make sure they are all there. It isn't a task that will help me pack. It is simply one task she got diverted to and is lost in trying to get it accomplished. (137 words)

As the people mill around and shift position, I end up very near the front of the line, right across from where the sons are standin at a doorway. They are trying to signal their servant to give them orders. I see their signal, and then I mouth to the servant who is also across from me and to the right of the sons, what the sons said. A narrator voice, male, says the sons have created a special bed for themselves on the throne area. Soft warm sheets, lots of pillows. I think, I'd do the same thing.

["Charla Falls"] I and two other people are walking down a series of corridors. I think we are pretending to be Star Trek characters. I am at the end of the line. I feel scared because I am vulnerable and someone or thing might jump out and attack me. I comment to the others I don't like being the one on the end. It's too dangerous. We turn a corner and come to a mezzanine level area. I look over the railing to the floor far down below. I feel scared I might fall. Suddenly I see Charla fall over the rail and I rush to the edge to see if she is all right. She lies crumpled up on the floor, the video camera she was holding, under her. People rush to her to check out if she is OK. They hand her up to my level to show me she is all right. She is curled up, still unconscious. Then there is a deli counter between us. A woman says sarcastically that I will give up and not stay to watch her, because of the deli counter in the way. I am angry at her. As I try to go to the right side of the counter, I discover that the counter goes along the entire edge of the railing. I can't get to Charla to confirm she is all right. (231 words)

Rich comes toward him, angrily telling him to back off. He's not the boss. I am lying on the ground between them. I say this isn't the best place to be. I stand up and walk to a clear area. I have to go pee and I sit on the grass, in full view of everyone, and put a silky orange scarf over me to be private. I know this is silly and I feel embarrassed. I pee, glad I don't have to poop. Now some woman hits a great fly ball out of the park. Jerome is talking with Tyler about how good the hit was. I join them trying to enter into the conversation. They ignore me. Suddenly I notice a huge tidal wave coming. I see the spray plumes up over the trees. My van is parked near the tree line. We stand there chatting about it. We should run for high ground. Jerome says. I agree and start to walk away from the tidal wave. Jerome suggests getting into the van. It at least would float. I think about doing that, then continue walking away. I come to a fence with barbed wire on top of it. Josh runs past me and leaps over the fence. I realize I will have trouble getting over this fence. I look beyond it and see the ground going steeply down hill. Will that be more dangerous? I clumsily scramble over the fence. (263 words)

["Bear Cubs And Sleeping Beauty"] I am in an old room with very high ceilings. A very tall thickly built man is there. I am looking around, because this is his house and I am curious about how he lives. It is run down, and junky, yet the room itself has elegance with the extremely tall ceilings. I see piles of old things and then I see a litter of bear cubs. Maybe 11 or 13 of them. They are cute and frisky. I pick one or two of them up and hold them. One has a very long thin snout, more like an anteater than a bear. The Mother bear is near by, watching comfortably. The man likes me. He is from some unsavory family. I like him too. He seems gentle. He stands up and I stand near him. I am amazed how much taller he is than me. I am aware of how his muscles are not in good shape. He is sort of pudgy, yet still good looking. He feels warm and cuddly, like a bear might feel, if you could trust the bear. I do trust the man. He lays me on a stretcher and I close my eyes pretending to be asleep. He carries me to other rooms in his house. His male relatives are suspicious of me. but the man and I just like each other. (228 words)

One, Mark, is from a dysfunctional home and is acting out all the time. He is smart, but failing. Merle is from a rich family and is always doing the right things academically. Merle is always on Mark's case pushing him verbally. Mark then responds angrily and gets himself in trouble. Merle is verbally attacking Mark and I walk up to Merle's desk amd lean in on him until he is in a corner. I look him straight in the eye and insist he listen to me. I tell him to leave Mark alone. I tell him he is jealous of Mark because he is so smart. They could be friends, if they'd let go of the animosity. I turn my attention to other children in the classroom. I am an excellent teacher. A man walks into the classroom wanting information about traveling. I help him find maps, even though I feel frustrated at being distracted from my classroom duties. I point out a city he is interested in visiting. I'm not sure if it is Hawaii or Mexico we are talking about. I show him where more maps are. He appreciates my help. I return to the classroom. Mark is standing up showing off to the class. He is smoking a white pipe. I wordlessly hold out my hand. He gives me the pipe and the matches and a wad of money, $5 and $1. His payment for goofing off. I put the pipe in the ashtray. I lecture him. He listens. We both know he'll continue goofing off when I'm not looking. (294 words)

["Tiger Man"] I am watching as someone lays a band across the throat of a man who is lying on a table. We are in some room. The man transforms into a tiger. Then he returns to his original form. This is scary. It means this man is potentially very dangerous, when he is a tiger. I watch as someone lays the band on his throat again. I see the dark bruise mark from the first time. The man starts to resist, then just gives up and lies back, accepting the restriction. Somehow this all means that Charla is dangerous. I use this as an excuse to insist she return to her mother. I want her to go right away, not even finishing the night at my house. I know somehow that I am giving up too easily and it isn't really necessary to do. Turns out that Lydia is her mother. They aren't home when I call. The baby-sitter doesn't seem to be helpful. She doesn't understand what I'm saying and won't take the message for Lydia. I realize that Charla will be fine and I don't need to rush this. (190 words)

I roll him over and get on top. I feel his penis hard against my vagina. I love that feeling. We make love. Now the people have arrived to get the information. (128 words)

["Holding Hands with Howard"] I go from house to house taking peoples bananas and walking around eating them. I wonder why I'm doing this, since someone could see me and get upset. This is stealing after all. But I do it anyway. Now, I am outdoors. Someone is going to show me an old swim pool and a creek. I walk over to the old swim pool, which is all filled with dirt and grass. All we really can see is the outline of where it used to be. From it, a creek flows. I walk over and look into the water. It is clear. Someone points out how the creek bed looks so natural. I say no it doesn't. It looks like it is formally set that way. Everything is too orderly. And there isn't anything in the water. Just then I see small round sea creatures and snails pop up from under the mud bottom. They spin there legs and move quickly around stirring up the silt. Someone asks me to take a scenic walk. We stroll down a path which is gravel. Howard is there now. We walk side by side. Chatting. I feel warm feelings of affection, but I am hesitant, slightly fearful it will turn sexual. We walk the pretty wooded path and talk. We hold hands. On the way back, we are in the backseat of a car. I rest my head on his shoulder, still worried he will become sexual.

I am walking down a church hallway looking for the room where several of us are going to have a church service, even though we are all different religions. I can't find the room, then I find it. But just then, I am aware of an odd snoring sound I make when I am breathing, that comes and goes. I decide I will go to the bathroom. I return down the hall, now being followed by Glenn Ford. He is attracted to me and we talk together. I explain I am having difficulties with this odd noise in my breathing. He says he has the same problem. Now I am in the bathroom and I sit on the toilet only to see Glenn Ford seated on a small couch. I am embarrassed and say I didn't know you were in the room. He says I'm sorry. But it's OK. We chat. Now I get up and I want to finish dressing. I ask him to leave for a moment. He steps out into the hall. Then I realize he has his shirt stuffed into the top of a dress I had been wearing, all balled up in his arms. I open the door and ask him to come back in with the dress. Then we stand close together trying to separate his shirt out of my dress. It is warm and friendly and fun. I like him very much. I realize I need to go to the bathroom again. I am glad we have decided to go to the same hospital together to figure out what is wrong with us. I try to blow my nose to clear the nose but that only makes it hard to breath. We leave, intending to be in the same hospital ward together. We are scared about the odd physical problem and happy to be together.

I am a young woman in the 19th century. I live in a mansion. I've been there all my life but alone and isolated, playing piano. Now one night I am playing some classical music on the piano. A distant "mother" is around somewhere. Daniel Day Lewis enters the room. He sees me and is enthralled with me and the music. He is romantic and beautiful. Lovely eyes that watch me with love. The mother doesn't want us to get together. I leave the room and go to a small lawn area outside, where my real family is. We are poorer. He follows me out. He lies down on the grass and says to me you must come back into the house with me. I love you and can't be separated from you for a moment. I am touched and I love him too. I go with him into the mansion. (151 words)

I walk into a store. I like it and decide to buy it. There are art and craft items. A man named Tom comes in and he wants to set up shop with adaptive devices for the disabled. He and his friends are very enthused. The old owner leaves and I am trying to figure out where things are and just what I have for sale. Lots of people seem to be wandering in and out. I am not selling anything. So I begin to look around to see what I now own. I see a Carl's Jr. booth being built. I see a double bed near a fireplace. Apparently I will live in the store as well. I see drawers and open them. I find art work and crafts. They re quite beautiful. I show them to my mother who is envious of the fine work. A salesman comes in to sell me some fix it tools. I decide not to buy anything yet until I know what I have and what is selling. A woman comes in to interview me as the new owner. I tell her I am surprised to be here, since I only arrived in this coastal town at 7:15 am and a half hour later I bought this shop. I am a bit surprised at myself for the impulsive choice. She asks me how I am being treated, being a woman manager. I say some of the men are surprised and condescending, but it's too early to tell yet. Now I go to the register counter area and there are children and people sitting there. I ask them to leave as this is my work area. The children tell me they are waiting for their parents who are helping me with the store. So I say OK, you can stay. Now a sweet baby girl is there wearing a cute pink outfit. She is cuddly and plump. I pick her up and tickle her, doing raspberry sounds on her tummy. She laughs and we are having a good time. Now I notice there are more rooms in the back and I go explore. I find a bird shop where I apparently own cocktails, some rare peach colored ones that are very expensive. I see baby birds also. A petting zoo. I go into the next room. It has two single beds, a shower and things accessible for the disabled. I think this will be a good place to live, so I can save the $340 a month for rent in the new apartment I got. Apparently my mother and I own the store. I own half of it and she owns one quarter. But I think she is going home soon. I find yet another room with lovely wooden bookshelves on one wall. I look out the window and the back area is a muddy mess and ugly. I close the shades. I enter the next room and realize I've entered the next shop. The owner, a man, comes to me and introduces himself, saying He is sorry he didn't greet me sooner. He did indeed notice my arrival but was waiting. We greet one another. (532 words)

I am in a large auditorium, sitting in the first few rows. Two or three lesbian women come around me, teasing me. They are challenging me to kiss and hug them. I smile and say this is not a problem. I feel comfortable, knowing I am not a lesbian. One woman kisses me. It is friendly. I laugh. They give up and go away. Now the people around me are part of a performing troupe I belong to. Kevin Kline is there and I don't like him. He is teasing me too. I am annoyed with him. He gives me a glass of champagne and I accept the challenge and drink it. I become giggly drunk pretty fast. Kevin takes advantage of this and playfully gathers me up in his arms and kisses me. I happily put my arms around him, giggling. We kiss, enjoying each other. An older man, like Capt. Picard, is the leader of our acting group. He wants us to the group to perform. Kevin gets up and walks across a long expanse of lawn. I watch him go, and then want to find him. I get up and run toward him. He jumps out from a small hill where he had been hiding. He and I suddenly make love. He enters me and I feel both of us have orgasm. A small group of people are standing near by, watching us. We don't care. Now the acting group is getting ready to do one more performance for a women's group. The small audience is coming into the auditorium. The actors are up on stage getting ready. I decide I will not join them this performance. I had not brought my script and I don't think I can remember the lines. I sit in the audience, watching. A blind woman, one of the actors is doing her act when she suddenly comes up to the edge of the stage and looks like she will fall over the edge. I know it's a part of her act and laugh when the audience rush up to save her. They realize the joke and gather up at the edge of the stage with great interest to watch more closely. Derek is there in the group as well. I regret now not being a part of the group. But now a woman has a strange boat that looks like a log hooked onto another log. I sit on the side log and she drives the other log as we race across the water, narrowly missing a tree. She is a good driver and we race back and forth having fun. Now it is fine with me I am not performing with the group. The woman makes a mistake and I am dumped into the water. I swim around. This is not a problem. (473 words)

I see a house that is for rent. It looks familiar to me like I might have looked at it before. I walk up to the front and peek in an open door to a made over garage that might be a large bathroom. I realize I have looked at this house before and liked it. I walk in the front door to see a group of men, who are showing the house. A man in a dolly for a wheelchair is looking at the house also. There is no furniture. The living room is large. I like it. I walk through the living room to a wide spacious hall with large windows on the left ad several doors off to the right. I walk down the hall into a bedroom, which has a double bed in it and a rectangle wooden box like cradle with a baby in it. An old man is there making the bed. I am quite excited. This is the house. I must have. And even the baby is there as I anticipated. He looks old and tired. Howard enters the room. I tell him this is the house I want. He says great We'll take it. I ask the man how much the rent is. He says $1500 a month. I wince, that is too much! Howard in his eagerness to have us back together is on bended knee if front of me wearing white pants and shirt. He says It's OK. I'll work it out somehow. I am unsure and concerned by I ignore those feelings because I want the house so much. I agree and we follow the man out to his office to close the deal. Howard goes first, the man and I follow as we walk up an outside stairway upstairs. The walking is difficult, because the steps are loose and wobble under my feet. I struggle to climb the stairs. The man says and there is $1300 a month for the conserve, which I understood to mean the insurance. Now it is clearly too much for us to pay. I hesitate. (352 words)

I am in a room, trying to quickly pack my most essential belongings. The Nazis are coming to take me away and I must try and trick them so I will still have what I need. I am most concerned I have my cortisone pills. I try to gather them up off the bed. And hide them in two small purses. I figure if there are two purses they might find one and I'd still have the other one. There are large books, like dictionaries and reference books I decide to pile them onto the other books and papers in the bookshelf, hoping that the people who own the house will keep them there for me in case I survive and return. A woman comes in and she sees what I did. She understands. She is warning me the Nazi's are here. She is scared for me and I am scared also. (152 words)

I am at some women's conference. In between sessions. I see Roseanne Barr on a stage. She is naked with an elaborate tattoo on her fat butt. Another woman is naked as well. They are laughing and talking about some topic. Roseanne sits down on a chair with her back to the audience to better show off her tattoo. She is enjoying this. She teases the audience by putting her hand back to cover her anus, like she's shy. Later I am walking around, looking for Charlotte Mesquita. I am walking right next to the naked Roseanne. Her breasts are very small. She is chuckling about her flat fat tummy. Now I go into the restroom to pee. Lots of women are in the stall, which is large with me. They are combing their hair and chatting. I wipe myself. Lots of shit, and it is messy. A woman wants to use the toilet and I hurry. A piece of shit falls on the floor and the woman kindly picks it up and puts it in the wastebasket for me. I feel embarrassed she had to do that. I get up and go out, still looking for Bonnie. I walk to a bench on the path with a pile of clothes and so on. I brush my hair which is in a short wedge cut with some of my long hair still in the back. I see Sonja leading a group of blind women in a line. I see Abner in another group. I call to Sonja that I will join her soon. I have a ten dollar bill tucked into my skirt waist to give to Bonnie when I find her. I go to a cabin where a mirror hangs on the outside to see if my hair looks OK. A woman is just inside the open door, sweeping. I can't really see myself in the mirror. I am wearing a long flowing colorful skirt. (326 words)

I am sleeping all night on a closed toilet. It is very uncomfortable. I wake up and I see Gus standing in a far corner of the room, watching. Marci is asleep on a day bed. She is having a nightmare. She tosses and turns, saying "Ouch," "Don't" She is obviously fending off someone in her dreams. Then she suddenly does a sort of somersault over the end rail of the bed and lands on her face on the floor. It must have hurt, but she doesn't wake up. I am worried about her and also aware this might be proof she was incested. I decide to write down what I saw. I get up. It's time to pack and leave. I walk downstairs. I see Aunt Rosalie in a room. I hesitate and then decide to ask her if she knows Ethan who I now think was the man I saw upstairs. I ask her and she becomes agitated and withdraws, saying no, she doesn't know him and for me to stop bothering her. I follow her out the room saying, Please tell me. I need to know. She doesn't answer. It's time for me to catch the train. (200 words)

I keep searching for my box. When I get there, everyone is gone and some other people are sitting there. I tell them to leave. They do. But they stay close by and try to set up their things very close by. I tell them again to move. Suddenly the young women return all upset and agitated about all the hostility around us.

I open my arms up in a grand gesture and walk around accepting the applause. And now the party becomes a daily celebration and it's sort of a church. I am the leader. A young man sits next to me at the table thrilled to be near me. Now I go to the big room to supervise the activities of the congregation. Some people are bringing in used objects from their homes to be given to others so they can be reused and useful. I am pointing out where to put the various projects. All of them are for helping other people. Later I am one of the citizens who come in to the police station to throw rocks at the helmeted heads of the criminals. A criminal is brought into a cage area and he pokes his head out of a hole. The helmet is to protect him from head injury. The purpose of this activity is to determine if he is guilty or not.

I am aware of how efficient I am. I reach over the seat to get my baseball uniform. It brings me closer to the man. He yearns for me. I get out of the car and hurriedly change. He watches me and is sexually aroused. I go play a terrific game of baseball. Then I rush back to the church to do my duties there.

I am acting in a small scene with a woman director. My role is to dive into a swimming pool and swim around. I do that. Then I get out and say to the director I have some suggestions to make about making the scene more dynamic and energetic with small quick edited scenes. She is not interested. She plans on doing two or three static scenes and that's it. I say to her I'm not trying to tell you your business but I am a playwright and she can use the suggestions or not, as she wishes. I am now in a large empty foyer of a public building which could be a church or a dormitory. There are large double doors that are open. People are trying to come in and I don't like that. I am trying to keep people out. A crazy man rushes in. I try to get him out but can't. So I go outside. I am standing near some storage sheds. A woman drives up and asks me for the key. I say I don't have the key. She is angry at me because she knows I have the key and she wants to store some small object. A man is with her and he comes up close to me, in a threatening way. He looks me in the eyes and says Look at this. His left nostril changes shape and becomes large and flat. His right ear does the same. From these spots he sends psychic energy out that creates a blue plastic cylinder which begins to move toward me in a threatening way. I am afraid and run back to the inside of the building I was in. I try to shut the doors. The crazy man is still there. He and I are now pounding a rhythm on a wall as a part of a performance of a play in the next room. He complements me on my "monologue" or solo part. He wants to see the play and I tell him it is five hours long. He says no problem. He and I seem to be friendly now. (359 words)

I am with a group of people in a large room. It's a work place. I try to be helpful by cleaning up things and putting them where they belong. The people are pilots and a call comes in for the Stealth Fighters to do a practice flight. I ask permission to join them. The officer thinks it over and says Not the Stealth Fighters, but you can join the crew on the cargo plane. I am disappointed but I agree, saying. At least it's flying. So now I am in the cockpit of the cargo plane. We are flying very low down a big city street with tall buildings on each side and many bridges to fly under. I am allowed to fly the plane. Someone keeps saying to me Pull it up, higher. We have to get under the bridges until we get high enough to get over them. I pull back on the steering wheel. The nose of the plane goes up and we get to our destination which is a man dangling off some high platform. The crew in the plane has a hatch open on top and he drops at the right moment and the crew pulls him in. Now we turn around to go back only very high winds start up over the water by the street. We try to fly back down the street but my instructor points out to me that if I had chosen to go as I was planning, I would have sheered off the wing. The instructor is standing at the post that would have done it outside the plane and the plane is not moving as I listen. He then suggests I fly out toward the water where there are not so many obstacles. I do so. (299 words)

I am at some outdoor rodeo festival. I am walking around. Two men are riding horses. One man is attracted to me and me to him, but he is married and has a family. We talk pleasantly for awhile. I ask him where he lives and he points off in a direction. I am confused and ask him again where? He says right there on the shelf with the cans of Pork and Beans, right next to the school. I then see another can of beans being placed there and nod. The other man gets off his horse and I get on. The horse suddenly becomes a bucking bronco. I struggle to remain on the horse wondering at the irony that my regular horse (or ride) is a bronco. Now I am off the horse and writing a message for the man I like in a platter of fried eggs. The message is, "The present contains the past and the future and sometime is a place." As I am hurriedly trying to finish the message for him to read, he is talking with someone else and slowly leaving. I realize he will not see the message. (196 words)

I am slim and wearing a red two piece suit and black high heels. Lucy and I are walking across a street toward a tavern area to socialize. No one will acknowledge me. Archie, with scraggly long hair, balding on top, won't give me eye contact. He walks past us, pausing to chat with Lucy. I walk back across the street, where I had been reconstructed. I walk slowly and stilted. There is a robot named Oscar that apparently had killed hundreds of people to get the parts needed to reconstruct me. There is a sense of fear. I am in danger. So are others. Then there is doubt. Maybe I was the one that killed them. (176 words)

I see the feet of my Mother and the man as he is raping her. I know he has also killed her. I run out of the house, afraid for my life. I crawl into a cupboard to hide, aware that that might be a bad decision, being so close and obvious. The woman finds me and I lie still, pretending to sleep. She pulls on my nipple to sit me up. She reaches for the other one and comments it is so flabby she can't get a grip on it. I angrily decide if she's going to be manipulating my nipple I might as well feel sexual. I will it to be so, but no sexual feelings. I just feel disgusted. Next I am in front of the house and crying in grief. I lie down in the snow and wave my arms making a snow angel. I am overcome by my Mother's rape and murder. A row of simple crosses are near me in the lawn. The dead pilot's graves. I hear them grieving also, for their own deaths. We all are in anguish.

I am traveling up a mountain to get to a meeting. I arrive and go into the meeting room. Nice people are wandering around. It is time to look outside and see the Great Lunum which was predicted to occur on June 11th. It is some spiritual prophesy that the world will have some special illuminecence that will be so incredibly beautiful and iridescent. I open the door and go out. I see two rainbows, beautiful clouds near a mountain. I notice that the Lunum isn't there, and wonder why we would want it anyway. Just plain ordinary nature is so beautiful, why would we want to add anything? I also chuckle at the people who came all the way up this mountain to see the view and all we can see is the inside of the fog. (138 words)

I am not interested in lesbian sex. I push her hand away. (148 words)

Ernie is around as I am preparing to get dressed for my paper presentation. It is friendly, emotionally intimate and helpful. I put on a pair of panty hose which later I see now has holes and runs in them. I put on a gray suit, the skirt zips up the front. I notice my tummy isn't as fat as in reality, but still has a bulge there. I am slim and looking very sophisticated. I feel good about my presentation. (81 words)

A man named Nate is addicted to some cough medicine. He is crazed by it. He grabs me and forces me into a lake. He needs to get across to get his next fix. He forces me to drink the medicine. I pass out in a stupor and he drags me across the lake. When we get across, there is a cabin. We go in and I am passed out. Time has passed and he is starting to come out of the stupor. He holds me in his lap and takes off my wet clothes. He falls in love with me and begins to make love to me. Because of this love, he fights the addiction and doesn't take the medicine. It is painful for him, but he does it. I am in love with him and help him. (139 words)

I am attracted to this nice man and he likes me too. We are shy. I get into a shower room. I am fully clothed and naked at the same time. A woman sits on the opposite end of the shower area, hanging out. The man walks in and sees me. I say "I'm taking a shower here." He is embarrassed and sexually excited and retreats quickly. Another man comes in and I say the same thing. I am drying off, and now I have a pretty pink dress from the 1950's on. The bra shows through the white see through insert at the top of the demur dress. The mist from the shower caused my hair to be curly and I look sweet, pretty and sexy. Subtle sexy. I walk out into the room where the man is. He is very sexually excited seeing me. We hesitate and slowly move closer for a wonderful sensual kiss. (157 words)

I am in a large school. I can't find the exit. Now I'm in a room, and Howard is there. I wonder if I could make love to him again. I think about it, wanting to be friendly, but can't quite feel right about it. He leaves, feeling fine because he has another wife. I walk down halls looking for the exit. I find one and go outside. Dotty is there. I want to know how Charla is doing. Now I go back into the school. I look in a room and go in to rest, only to realize it is a graduate student's office. I see their things on the table. I leave again. Now I am rolling on the floor with S., exercising. I tease her that her upper body will be stronger than mine, but I can beat her with isometric exercises against her legs. Now we are walking together down a hall which has like a raised roadside edge where I find crystal rocks. I examine one and decide it is nice but not spectacular enough to take. I find a nice small one I like. Then we turn a corner and I find a pink marble egg. I realize someone lost it and I take it to a nearby store. The Asian man who lost it left a letter asking if they would return it to him, should anyone be honest enough to return it. He is very happy. I find a letter and I sneak a peak at it, looking around to see if Susie or anyone else is watching. I see the name Beverley. I try to remember who she is, I know I know her, but can't place it. Maybe she was one of Howard's wives. I put the letter down, half read and go on walking with Susie. (307 words)

A baby is packed in a box with other things. I become concerned for it's safety and open the box. I see that it is very hot in there and the baby has sweated so much it is lying in a pool of water and is in danger of drowning. I try to pick it up. Some green leaves fall in the water and I try to scoop them out before they melt into the water and choke the baby. I finally get the leaves out. I pick up the baby. He changes into a tiny little baby, deformed like Merle. I hold him in my hand. Now the baby changes again into a small kitten who hungrily sucks on my thumb. I being a mouse or some small animal to it so it can get some milk. The tits are brown and the right size for the kitten. It drinks. (151 words)

I am entering a store that is similar to a cement parking garage. I am there to choose a free gift. Before I can find the gift, a huge wave of water floods the entire area and I am walking down an incline. I realize I am in danger and turn to walk back up before I drown. I struggle, holding on to a curb to guide my way. I see a white water wave coming at me. I grab a plant from under the water and get out of the store. Now I am walking to find my van. I see it is parked safely up on a hill. But the way to it is cut off with a swelling river in a canyon. I will have to wait before continuing my journey. I think Ginny is there now. (140 words)

I am on a shopping trip with my girls, between the ages of 3 and 8. Dovre decides she wants to go to a church down the street. I let her go and accompany Paulina to another church which looks like a cafeteria. A Holy Bible is on our table and a woman comments on it being one of the older ones. I tell her it's not my bible, someone else must have left it there. Paulina isn't eating her plate full of eggs. I ask her why. She says the plate is dirty. I say we'll order a new one. It's OK. I worry now that I shouldn't have let Dovre walk to the other church alone. Maybe she is in trouble. I am thinking of going on shopping, when I feel my throat close up and reach my arm toward the far side of the mall where I'd left my wheelchair and water bottle. I gasp. My water, my water. Then I choke. (165 words)

I am in a pickup with Charla, Lenny, and Kyle. Kyle is driving. He pulls right up to an edge of a cliff. I say Don't do that! I am afraid we will go over the edge. And then we do. We slide off and fall. I see the huge lake and the land. We are going to die. I exchange Charla for Lenny, thinking I would have a better chance of saving a smaller child and Charla would have a better chance with Kyle. I am surprised it is Kyle and not Howard in the relationship, but I yell out "I love you all." to them and add, "I wish I'd been a better person." My last words, I thought. Then we decide to eject out of the pickup before it lands. I clutch Lenny as we fall. I try to stretch or move toward the water and manage to land in the water. We survive and I swim, holding Lenny to the shore. I lay in the water's edge with broken ribs on my right side, surprised and in shock that we lived through it. Some man is backing a boat into the lake when he sees us at the edge of the boat landing. He takes us to the hospital, which is an old house, converted to a hospital. A woman caseworker asks me some questions about Charla. I tell her that Charla has used swear words like "Bitch" at me. The caseworker wants to have the case sent to her and I say you already have the files here. She says but that's not the case. I don't understand. I think they are the same thing. Now I walk with Lucy up several flights of stairs to our hospital room. I see Kyle is in a bed, and Lenny is in the bed between Kyle and me. I am relieved. I feel very uncomfortable that I am supposedly in relationship with Kyle. Several of his buddies are there talking with him. I want a regular bed, but Lucy chooses it. I decide the hospital bed is just fine and lie down, exhausted. Some nice man is at the head of the bed trying to adjust it to make me more comfortable. (375 words)

I am in a room. Two women and myself are listening to a man named Bob how is lecturing on some subject. One of the women has already spoken on this subject and he discounts her thoughts and feelings. He is boring and not very accurate. After the speech, he realizes he has not done well and that the woman was correct. He looks for her to apologize. He respects her now. The women say it's time to go home. We walk out the building and down the street. A bus passes us with cute animals like penguins seating in them. Another bus goes by with a paper mache stork in the back. I am tired now and so the woman uses her remote control to call the car to us. It rushes past us, the bumper dangling down. It is broken. It smashes over a cliff and falls to the desert floor. We go to the edge and look over, I feel fear and vertigo. The woman was pulled into the crash and killed. She rises as a fairy angel spirit. Bob is now a red devil suited spirit and she makes him chase her in an opposite direction from us to save us. We are now tiny, like fairies and walk through a hedge with beautiful purple flowers. We see on the other side a meadow with a fairy castle at the far end. I see white dog dragons flying toward us, sent by the fairy woman to help us. I am amazed to see that we are really in a meadow right next to the outskirts of our home town. The buildings are huge and loom high above us. (282 words)

I am mopping the floors of a house that looks a bit like the Mac House. The rooms are spacious with very little furniture. I am in the kitchen and another woman is also helping me clean. I mop the kitchen, the dining room and the living room. My "husband" Jerome comes home from work and he has invited a man and his wife to dinner. I greet them in the living room where they are seated on a couch. He is brusque and asks me what I am serving for dinner. I say I thought I'd send out to the store for fish filets. He frowns and says he only eats Layton's Mayo. I say then I will buy some. I walk back into the kitchen where Jerome and the teenage boys are seated at a table. Jerome is annoyed that the man only will eat Layton's Mayo. He hates that brand. I then leave to him to decide if we get that kind of Mayo. I look over at another table and see it full of wonderful desserts, breads and casseroles. Jerome apparently made them. So we eat. I hope some of the desserts are sugar free. Now I am doing the dishes and cleaning up after the meal. The house is different now. A modern spacious house. Large windows across the back kitchen wall. I look out and see a tornado funnel coming at the house. I see several male children in the back yard. A woman is there also and is sucked up by the tornado. I run out to rescue a boy in the path of danger. I grab him just as the other boy is held upside down by the tornado. As I cling to the boy, I yell No, No at the tornado. That somehow makes it back off. I run back into the house. Now I walk back around a curved hall to the living room. I see a young man tap dancing. He had some earlier reputation as a good professional dancer, but no one recognizes him. A young woman comes in. Her name is Rose. The man and the woman are going to meet and dance together. I watch this. Now I am somewhere else, and returning home to find it destroyed by the tornado. I stand on the flat boards left and see a crudely built mail box in the shape of a simple house. Now I am staying overnight in a beautiful spacious house where Jerome and his wife live. I get up in the morning and walk through the curved hall seeing a couch and TV sets and fireplaces along the way. I decide I want to go home now rather than stay longer. (457 words)

I, the dreamer is observing myself in this dream. I am standing in the back yard of my house. Which is the front yard of a man like Tyler I am staring in horror at the flames spreading from the next door apartment I was living in to the house my kids and I live in. As I am watching, I slowly realize that I am simply standing there, watching the fire grow and spread. I suddenly remember Charla is upstairs in the bedroom close to the outside wall next to the flaming apartment. I run into the house and upstairs calling frantically for Charla. As I rush into the house, I stop and see firemen coming to put out the fire in the apartment. Then I go into the bedroom and search for Charla calling out for her repeatedly, scared she is dead. I find her in her bed sleeping and call to her to wake up. She slowly wakes up and I pick her up and run out of the house with her. Now I am back in the back yard having returned to the comfort of the man. There are several other men there and I stand there holding Charla who is actually like a limp rag doll, hanging nearly upside down and in my left hand a fist full of dollars, which are turning into fake money. Some of the young men had found some of the money I dropped as I had run across the lawn. I tell them it is mine, but they don't believe me. Apparently I had, while rescuing Charla, stood there for a moment thinking about what other important Items I should grab up and take with me. Suddenly I remember I don't know where the other two girls are. I am frantic and run back to the house, upset with, myself for not being able to remember to rescue them in the first place. How could I have forgotten them? I look in the windows from the outside to see if they are in their bedroom, on the far side of the house away from the fire. No one there. I fleetingly wonder if Howard is there. I go back in and back upstairs. I go into my bedroom, which is across the hall from Charla's bedroom. I repeatedly cross the hall to her bedroom looking in to see the condition of the meter that shows status of the fire and the electrical workings of the house. I am concerned about it. It won't go back to normal and so I worry there is something still wrong. I am tired and lie down on my bed. It is dark and I hear men coming up the stairs. A policeman is bringing Howard home, drunk. The talk at the door way of my bedroom. Then Howard comes in stumbling and falls dead drunk on my bed. I get up immediately, upset and angry. A grown daughter with several of her children and her husband come up the stairs. She comes in. I say to her. There he is, drunk. I hate that man. The husband says to me "Give him a break. It's only once." I am furious with the husband and I rush up to him, causing him to back up. I yell at him. You don't know all the things I've gone through with him. You have no right to talk to me like that." He thinks I'm crazy or a bitch. The daughter, holding one child and the other child sleeping on the floor downstairs, is now sitting on my bed with an open bible. She is upset about not being able to learn her bible lesson for tomorrow's service. She is saying "I don't remember if it was Ezeakial or Issaih or who that said whatever to whomever." I remember again I still don't know where Dovre and Paulina are. I go back down the hall and start to pass a second bedroom. I pause, go back and into that bedroom to find Dovre on the floor (she is perhaps 8 or 9 years old.) She is still sleeping. I shake her repeatedly to wake her. Finally she sleepily responds. I find Paulina/Ellie as a toddler, maybe 2 years old, in the bed all curled up and sleeping. I pick her up and try to wake her as well. She turns into a plastic toy. I carry them both out of the room, relieved to have found them and not understanding how they could have slept through so much for so long! I recheck the meter. I ask my daughter's husband to look it over as well. He says it's fine. I don't believe him and go in to look again. I pull open the top drawer in a dresser to see a stack of old letters. Love letters, I think but as I look at them, I see they are letters from men I knew long ago but not real close. One was a military young man named Brent. I close the drawer. I look at the meter again. I return to my bedroom. There is now another bed and several phones on it. One of them rings. I am surprised because it is the middle of the night. I answer it to hear Dovre asking me Do I have a phone? I hang up. I then explain to my grown daughter how I was so slow to respond to the fire. I told her I just stood there in the apartment looking at the small flames thinking it will go out on its own. Then as it spread, I watched it, dully not feeling any concern. Then when it was almost too late, I suddenly realized the danger for me and my children. I feel stupid and neglectful. I feel guilty for not remembering Dovre and Paulina. (982 words)

Charla is a beautiful child preparing for making it big in Hollywood. I am her chaperone and helper. She has perfect blonde hair in a bouffant style. We are at a place where the Hollywood hopefuls come to train and be discovered. There are hundreds of them. I am filled with love and pride of how beautiful Charla is. The scene is surrealistic, neither indoor or outdoor. No walls. Charla is tap dancing. I say that tap dancing is a strange style of dance. A narrator remarks that there is always one or two specially talented people that come in and are recognized immediately. One dances by. Charla is trying to sneak past me wearing three different dresses, one on top of the other. She's trying to meet a young boy somewhere. I tell her she can't fool me. I tell her to go back. Another woman is around. Now I am flying in some sort of structure like a parking garage. Only this is where artists who didn't make it are stuck forever. It's the Loser Highway. The flying space is like the curved way cars drive in parking garages. I see other losers caught in there, one man tethered to the structure and trying to fly. It is very sad. Another man is heart broken because he created wonderful artistic pictures in there but now that he is trying to return to regular earth, the pictures disintegrate and are ruined. All his talents and work destroyed. Now I am told to fly over the producer's desk. I fly over there. He is a big noisy man. Flashy dresser. (270 words)

A woman friend and I are Hollywood stars. We are shopping and having fun. We meet these two men and they join us. It's a sort of outdoor mall. We try on different blouses and they try on shirts. The shirts are velvet and very soft to the touch. The man I'm with comes toward me and I stroke the large lacy collar of his shirt to feel the sensual softness of the shirt. My friend's man comes over in a more tailored version. I touch his shirt also. He and I are attracted to each other. He likes me to touch him. We walk on. My man and my friend wander off and her man (like the game host on Hollywood squares, Tom) and I sit and talk. We clearly are growing more affectionate and really like each other. There is hesitation because he is my friend's man. Suddenly it begins to rain grasshoppers. I don't like that and Tom and I duck into a corner of a store front. The other man ducks into another place nearby. Tom is very efficient and helpful asking the proprietor of the store if we can come in. He says no. Tom goes in to get what we will need to be comfortable. A Mexican man comes up to me and asks if I want to buy a cover to put up to protect us. I say You will have to ask the gentleman. I really like that he is taking over and arranging everything for my comfort. Tom returns with several pairs of rubber boots, a bottle of something and something to eat. The Mexican man is putting up the cover which causes Tom and I to have to cuddle close together. We look at each other longingly. He adores me and I feel filled with love and sexual excitement. He tenderly kisses me. I love it. But I pull back, remembering he is my friend's man. He smiles gently at me and says, I won't do that again until I've talked with Carol and broken off with her. Carol is now with my man and they seem to be fine with each other. It won't be long now and Tom and I will be able to make wild passionate love. I look forward to it. (385 words)

I am in bed with Jennifer H. I sleep like I did with Howard, always facing away from him because I didn't want to be close, because then he'd want sex. She falls out of bed on the floor and twitches. I look over at her wondering if she is having an epileptic seizure. She gets back in bed. I had turned to sleep in that direction but when she got in bed again, I turned back to face away from her. I fell the same resistance and guardedness I felt with Howard, like he was going to pounce on me. Now we are out of bed. Jennifer is upset and wants to talk about our relationship. I do not want to talk about it. I avoid her. We are actually in a sort of camp ground area, even though the bed is a regular double bed. Charla is there now. She and I are talking in a friendly way. Jennifer finally bursts out with the question about what is our relationship. I say I don't want to talk about it. She says you won't even look at me. I say I'm sorry. I can't do it. That's the way I am. I have trouble looking at people. It's me, not you. She is very sad. I repeat that I am sorry if I hurt her, but I just don't want a relationship with her. I say Charla is really the only person I've ever had a real emotionally good relationship with. Jennifer sadly leaves. (255 words)

I am still at the campground where Jennifer H. left. A man comes by and we talk. We like each other. Charla and I are packing things up to leave. Another silly man comes by and makes friends with the first man. They talk about how they are Indians. The silly man is a Crow Indian and the other names a tribe. I get into a small black car, which had been Jennifer's. She had left it. It has a clutch. It is easy to drive, but I will tire of the clutch pedal soon. I am waiting for the man to come by and drive that away while I drive my van. The man comes playfully around a corner wrapped up in a blanket like a cocoon. He and Charla are playing games. I chuckle. We all get along fine. (141 words)

I am being pursued by a Nazi woman who is trying to capture me. I run but she keeps after me. I run up a long flight of stairs. I know I am inside a building but there are not normal rooms, it's like a stage facade of stairs and windows and a door across a long drop off where the hall would have been. A door opens on my left as if from across a hall. A man, like Robert Taylor comes out and sees me. He is a nazi also. The woman catches up with me and I am forced to sit on a couch on a sort of balcony. Other female nazis are there. Robert sits next to me on my left, very close and ups his arm around my shoulder to grasp my right hand. He uses a double pronged needle to inject something into me. I struggle but I am trapped. He begins to skin my hand with a small knife. I don't feel much pain, like only the top layer of skin is being removed. It is being skinned off like a glove. I beg him to stop, but he smiles and continues. Then suddenly he is sexually excited and says I want to do her. I am now still seated on the couch but he is naked and on top of a beautiful naked woman with large breasts. Her figure is shaped like Seven of Nine's on Star Trek Voyager. I see his thin penis dangling down as he gets on top of her. His skin is very dark brown, compared to the white of the woman's skin. I see her face as he thrusts very business like in her. He comes quickly. The woman got no sexual enjoyment of the rape. She looks pained and scared. I take this moment to run again. (311 words)

I am running from the Nazi's. I duck into a cross dressing bar. Ellie is in there dressed as a woman and so are all the men. I am a woman, dressed as a woman pretending to be a cross dressing man. I sit at a table with two pretty men. I am wearing a maroon long velvet dress with a scoop neckline and slits up the back to reveal my shapely legs. Ellie knows its me and pretends to not know me, but smiling at me. A midget with a limp, male and dressed as a male, comes up to me and asks me to dance. I say yes. I stand and take his hand, walking and semi dragging him along. We weave through the tables and find a small empty spot and begin to dance. Then the midget falls in love with me. Then some regular non gay men come in to harass the cross dressers. They also bring jeans and leather pants. The cross dressers are choosing which ones fit. I pass a few along, holding them up to me. I say too bad I'm so fat. Some cross dresser says women's pants are always too small for me. I see that Robert Taylor, the Nazi, and his men have entered. I try to walk out but they capture me. We are walking down the front steps of the bar when the midget flings himself at me to knock me down the stairs hoping he would kill me so that I wouldn't suffer at the torture the Nazi's were going to inflict on me. I fall down the stairs and so does he. I am unhurt and he is injured. He begs for my address. Someone says it and he runs to a wood box just outside my house so he can live close to me. As I am walking down the sidewalk, a woman in a wheelchair with dark hair and missing legs up to the knees and the under half of her breast cut off wheels up to me. She shows me her breast which she will reconstruct later, she says. I ask her for her car keys. She says you'll never make it. But she throws me the keys. I make a break for it and jump into her small convertible car in the yard next to my house that we were walking toward. It is a silly plastic car. But I start the motor and race away with Robert in hot pursuit. I crash through the fence and a metal pole and drive down the streets. A woman says you can't do that with that car, it's plastic. But I succeed anyway. I abandon the car and run into a shed and hide under some hay. I burrow through it to the back wall, ripping off some of the boards and crawling through. Several men, while talking with each other, come close and look in. I am somehow in plain sight even though supposedly hidden. They pretend not to see me as they are actually undercover agents for my side. Somehow now I am the man and I am having sex with a woman. I am thrusting at her from behind and on top. I am sexually excited. (545 words)

I am a part of a class. Someone suggests some study tips and I write them down on a young woman student's notebook for her. I tell her I did that to help her. I feel interfering but it is for a good reason. Now, I am in an audience. A woman on stage asks a question. I walk quickly up the stairs to on stage to answer it. I answer it correctly. She gives me a look meaning What a jerk. Always has to be a know it all. I then walk backstage, having had the intention of leaving early and this is a good opportunity. She follows me and says you're going the wrong way. I say, no, I want to go downtown. I leave, opening the pretty glass door near the large window. (like it was a house, not a theater.) I walk downtown. (147 words)

I am in a classroom. I am making something artistic, using a paint brush. I am seated because a man teacher is lecturing. I look up to see him looking at me disapprovingly for doing something else while he lectures. I continue painting but then stop. I put the paint brush on the edge of a desk. Then I see that large globs of yellow paint are dripping off the brush. I don't know what to do, so I put my hand under it to catch the globs as they fall. Now I have a messy hand full of paint. I look around and see a box, under a daybed. I put it there. I'll save it for another young woman to use in her project. Now some other man is announcing that this session was taped by NPR. I say to the teacher if I'd known it was NPR, I'd have written a real poem. (meaning the one I read I'd just casually written, it wasn't a really good piece of work.) I see I have black oily stuff all over my hands and I try to clean them off. I want to help this young woman do her project before I leave. I want to talk with the teacher before he leaves. I am attracted to him. He then walks out and I feel disappointed. Later a woman sits next to me and I realize she is the teacher. I'm not as interesting in talking with her. (249 words)

I am in a driveway with a woman and Lucy. I am handing Lucy cards. She stares at it and then I tell her what's on it. I then remember that she is totally blind. I feel stupid doing this and embarrassed. The woman suggests we go to a store that is down a steep dirt path. I say not now. I am interested in the clothes they sell there but I am worried about if the path is accessible or not. Later I change my mind. I call Lucy and ask if she can come over and help me go to the store. She says sure. Justin is home all afternoon. I remind her not to be late because it is 2:30 PM and the store will close and I need to take my pickup to get more gas. They come over. Lucy and my father get in the back of the pickup. I help them get comfortable. I ask Justin if there is enough room for him. He says no (even though there was). So Justin and their child get up in the front seat. I am driving. We go to someplace where there is a mechanic. He will fix some part of the pickup that has been broken for a long time. Two men are there talking about the event that is going to happen on the huge snow field right in front of us. I decide I want to get a good seat, so Justin and I go to a corner on the left of the snow field. I park my wheelchair. I decide it will be too uncomfortable sitting in the chair for a long time, so I put my purse on the ground and then I scoot out of the chair and to the ground in front of the foot pedals. I am crowded and uncomfortable. I move the purse to the chair seat. I tell Justin he can sit in my chair. I am worried that my chair and me take up too much space. (342 words)

I am in a house with many many rooms. It used to be "my" house, and I am selling it to Abner. I realize that I mostly live in one or two rooms. I tell Abner there are some incredible rooms in this house... But I haven't used them in years. I am cleaning up to make ready for Abner to take over the house. I look out a window and see beautiful birds. Someone said look at the Thunderbirds. I see exotic colored birds, greens, spots of red and yellow. They are actually having sex. I see a huge white feathered bird that looks like an eagle. I'm not sure if it is alive. I go outside to speak to Abner. Howard is working in a garden. So is Abner, further up the path. Later some man and myself walk down a hill in a wooded area behind the house and enjoy the spacious beautiful area. Perhaps a river runs through it. (163 words)

I am supposed to give a presentation with Oprah watching. I am digging around in my suitcase for the video Ophrah wants me to show and the file folders of information I will present. I can't find them. The audience is waiting in the other room of this house and I chatter on while I search to keep them occupied and interested. I tell them of a journey from Central America to my home in Connecticut with a car I was transporting from one place to the other. I am telling this story for the benefit or entertainment of a man who had a similar experience. I can't find the stuff after looking three times through the suitcase. I cheerfully say to Ophrah and the waiting audience this isn't a problem. I know the material by heart and will give them a good presentation without the material. I apologize to Ophrah for losing her video. I know she considers it important and informative. (163 words)

I am at a dance. Michael J. Fox is there and is dancing with a woman. I dance alone. No one invited me to dance. I feel sad. Michael is watching. He then comes over to me and invites me to dance. I am surprised and pleased. We dance. Then he continues to chat with me after the dance is over, walking with me. He has his arm around my shoulder in a friendly way. I am surprised to realize he is so short. He has to reach up to put his arm around my shoulder. I remember I am standing now and that is why he seems shorter. We walk out of the building together. He takes me to his family's home. A large tent where people are eating and talking. He introduces me to his father and another relative, maybe an uncle. They are very impressed with the fact that he has brought a woman home to meet them. They are speculating if we are getting married or not. Michael says to them, of course we will get married. I am surprised and pleased again. The family is large and friendly. Now the family home is a huge mansion, with a large green field for a front lawn. We are walking down the hall when a man tells me his father cheats on his wife as is the custom in this family. I am now outside looking at the mansion from across the field. I begin walking across toward the mansion. I see vendors with tables. I am hungry and ask to buy some food. The woman says you have money, don't you? I say I'm sure I have some on me and if not enough, then we'll go up to the house. She is very suspicious. She follows me. I ask her what is the price of this dish of ice cream? She says $25. I am shocked at the outrageous cost. It must be because this is such a rich neighborhood. (335 words)

I am in a huge black cave and the German soldier comes up to me and grabs my butt to feel if he wants to rape me or not. My butt is flabby and I hope that means he will not be interested in me.

I am in some large building and am in charge of keeping people from going up to the 2nd and 3rd floors. I see a black man and several white people going up the stairs. I scurry over saying You can't go up there. They laugh at me and go up anyway. I go up there to get them out, worried that they will steal things. I see a group of old ladies at a long table in one hall. I ask what they are doing. They say they are attending a workshop that will last 60 days. I decide it's OK for them to be there. I go back downstairs, tired and overwhelmed. Then I realize I could hire someone to keep an eye on the upstairs. I go to a desk where a woman (Diane of Uni house) sits with a hat that says Wonder Woman. She is very busy and doesn't pay any attention to me. I see Ginny. She tells me she is staying at a different hotel and will be having dinner out with other friends. I am surprised and a bit hurt. Then I see Ginny is sad. I try to cheer her up.

I ask. She says yes. (246 words)

I am walking down a sidewalk. I am looking down the street to see if there is a grocery store down that way. I think maybe there is one, even though that direction is toward the fancy government and museum buildings. A man calls out to me to come on down that way. I abruptly turn and walk the opposite way. They laugh at me for being afraid. I think they are ruffians who will lure me there and hurt me. Now I am walking toward a theater building. Really good performers that I respect are there. They want me to join them. I struggle up a steep ramp to get to the top of the roof of the building. Sparky and others are there and want me to act in this Shakespearean play. And also direct them in it. I agree to do so. But now I am naked and crawling on my belly because I am paralyzed from the waist down. There are two people in wheelchairs that are acting in this play. I am proud of that (one of them is me.) But I am embarrassed to find myself naked and crawling on the ground as I go about my duties of creating an excellent play. (209 words)

I am lying on a bed, trying to sleep. Howard is seated near me. We talk. He is being helpful, trying to help me understand something that would be good for me to know. Later, He is lying in the bed with me. I "wake up" in the dream and realize that Howard is dead. He can't be there in my bed. I turn and look. He is not there. Then he talks to me. So now I'm wondering if I really looked or if I dreamed I looked. I am confused if he's really there or if I am dreaming it. Now my Mother comes in with a gift for me. A display holder of many different pens, all bright and interesting colors. I exclaim happily she couldn't have given me a better gift. I love multi colored pens. I hope she doesn't look into the living room where I have my own set just like it already. I don't want to make her upset or unhappy. (168 words)

A kind man, like Dwight B., comes over to talk with me at a party. He is gentle. As we talk I realize I like him. Then he slowly reveals that he knew me years ago when I was going to school and married to Howard. I now remember he was at OSU in a class. He liked me then. I look in his eyes and realize he loved me then and still does love me. We sit on a couch and cuddle, slowly getting closer and closer. Now it is the next morning and I awake in his families house. I am exhausted from partying all night and my arthritis hurts. I have bandages on my left hand, which is deformed like my right hand. I am bare foot. And walking with crutches. It hurts to get up and move. His family is nice to me, observing to see what kind of woman he brought home. I hear one of the children talking about Dwight's dream all these years of combining our foster homes we've created and working together. I tell the child I didn't ever do that.

I am visiting Mary Sue and Dwan. I want to see their remodeled house and the progress they are making. I look at the outside. I see new window panels just like the ones in my remodeled room. Long and narrow. There are still more to put in but they have put in more since I last looked. Now we are inside. Dwan and I are talking. She asks me about being a lesbian. I grimace and say I just don't feel comfortable with it. Dwan says why not? I say I don't know, it doesn't feel right. She laughs at me, because she and Mary Sue are quite happy together. I then look into a bedroom they remodeled. It is very pretty with a double bed and lots of pillows and comforters. I see another bedroom and look in there also.

I am a young beautiful model in a swim suit at the beach. William Shatner is there. As I walk past him, I make comments that are sarcastic because he was being self centered and arrogant thinking I would fall for him. He has the beginnings of a pot belly and gray hair. He jokes back with me and we build a kind of friendship based on our mutual respect for wit and fast thinking. He follows me as I walk through a crowd of people on the beach and lie down on a sand dune, between two other women who are sun bathing. I ask one how her relationship is going. She says they are about to get divorced. I am sad for her and say That is the saddest part of a relationship.

I and two girls, perhaps my "children," are walking up a path with a bunch of other people. We are going to the top of a mountain ridge. As I approach the top, I feel small earthquakes. Then I see a steam vent. The steam is pouring out. I realize we are on an active volcano that is about to erupt. I turn, with the girls and run downhill, yelling to the other people that the volcano is erupting. We run and run, then I see a river. There are wild animals in it, swimming fast to escape the volcano. I see elephants, alligators and mountain lions. We get in the water with them, knowing they are just as afraid of the volcano as we are and wont bother us. We swim and swim until the river is now dry and a small long tunnel. We run, hoping we are not trapped in there. Finally we get through to the other side but the lava is converging on us. We are then rescued in the nick of time by a helicopter just as the lave surrounds us on an island of rock. (192 words)

I request a small model of the school be place at a perspective where I can draw it. I am in an open field. A woman places it. I keep asking her to move it here and there, because it is so far away I can hardly see it. It has classical designs with columns and a domes ceiling. Finally I apologize to her and say I'll just walk over to it and see it there. I must walk into the dark wooded bushy area to go past my van parked there. I feel a moment of fear at the dark wooded area and then muster up my courage and walk in there. The scene shifts and I am preparing a meal in the cottage where I live with the other young teen women. It is a beautiful kitchen with many interesting wine kind of bottles.

["Lazy PA."] I am on a motorcycle wearing black leather jacket and a white scarf around my neck. I am driving on a mountain road. Suddenly a man in a car comes around me and stops, blocking the lane of traffic. He's out to get me. I turn and drive up a steep gravel road to Ginny's "house." I try to drive in but finally get off the motorcycle and walk in, locking the doors. The scene shifts. I am walking down a city street. I want to take a bath, even though it isn't scheduled until tomorrow. I tell my PA to prepare the special stretcher, bathtub we have. She is annoyed and wants to wait until tomorrow. I insist. I lie down, on the stretcher which has a special head rest for the shampooing. It feels comfortable, even though I am outside on the sidewalk. I believe I am clothed as well. Again, the scene shifts and I am in my van as a passenger. My PA stops in traffic in the turning lane and lets me out. I am annoyed she is blocking traffic. I am standing. She says she'll bring my wheelchair but she wants to use it too, She's tired. I am confused and a bit upset with her. She parks the van up the road and brings a manual wheelchair. Now I am walking down the sidewalk with another woman. I see a store window display of many large tropical fish, all flat and orange gold color with one large round black spot on it. Someone picks one up and bites off its tail. I feel queasy. They bite into the body and I can't look any more. My friend sees a display of round pendants on the sidewalk for sale. She lies down on the sidewalk to see them better. I bend over and look too. (311 words)

["Registering for classes."] I am at a college, standing outside the building in a long line. It is time for registration. The doors open and the people rush in, I manage to be third in line and would like to be first because I only have a quick question. But I am asked by the woman teacher to wait over at another table. I sit and wait, watching the masses of students milling around frantically trying to get registered. I wait a long time. Finally it is my turn. I try to ask my question but the words are confusing and I am frustrated, Now I go to another room. I am looking through cupboards and seeing food things people had brought. I see three different kinds of bread. Nothing I am too interested in eating. I decide this isn't the right place for me. Lots of milling students. I ask a woman there something. She shows me a weird expanding cane, walker. She suggests I use that. I say it's too big and complicated. Then she shows me a more regular cane, I hold it backwards, She shows me the "right" way to hold it. I walk a few steps. Every time the cane touches the floor with a tap it is echoed through the clock. I say this doesn't work for me. I decide to leave the classroom. I go the bookstore. I am thinking of taking some classes and want to see what the books would be and how much they will cost. I am in a corner of the bookstore looking a shelves of books. Math books, science fiction. I almost buy some and then frustrated, I put them back. I feel really upset because I remember I've done this a number of times, taken classes and then not finishing them. A frequent dream motif but it feels so real I wonder unhappily if I've really done it again. I find one class in linguistics and am genuinely interested, thinking it would be a good class to take. I look at the description a weird word, looking something like division department or something. It would be too slow and tiring. (361 words)

He talks about Mr. Spock and science fiction books. The teacher is annoyed. She says, so then your question is about finding an old friend?

["At home in the outback."] I am creating a play. It has comedy and family stuff and relationships in it. There is a stage in the living room of the family home I am in. My sister Lydia is helping me set up things on the stage. We are placing things we no longer want on the stage. A toaster oven. A TV. Junk. I ask a woman if it's all right to burn some of these things. She says yes. I walk behind the stage and rearrange some of the things. I decide I want to keep the TV and the toaster oven. I move them farther from the main area so they won't burn with the rest. I walk back around to the front of the stage. Jerome is there. I ask him if he will watch the play. He laughs and sneers saying it is insignificant. He has no interest in something that isn't big and important. I am insulted. I return sarcastic remarks back at him. Then he sneers at the skirt I am wearing. He names the brand. He says he can't take seriously anyone wearing a "Bobbir" skirt. I sneer back and say so who is being caught up in insignificant things. Brand names of clothes. OH boy, such important stuff. He feels embarrassed. I got him there, Now I strike a match and try to light the things on fire. The curtain is closed in anticipation of the burning as a performance. It goes out so I start balling up pages of newspaper. I hand some to Lydia. We prepare the papers and stuff them around the objects. I light another match or two and the fire starts. Now I am Whoopi Goldberg in an all white skirt and blouse. I have traveled to perhaps the Australia outback, although it looks like a suburban neighborhood. Jerome had traveled there to learn about birds. I meet a woman and her daughter, both black. The woman welcomes me graciously. And is walking me to the back yard, through the house. She is saying she is almost ready for the hunt. She must finish filling the bathtub with water. The hatchet is ready to chop off the bird's head. I feel a bit queasy about that part. The girl is talking about two birds she has already seen, one an Owl, she says. The woman smiles. She had misnamed the type of bird. I am determined however to participate as well as I can and as fully as I can in the ceremonious hunt. The girl and I are being initiated, I guess. We walk out to the back yard. Black men and Jerome (white) are out there. The ritual begins. I watch as the girl contorts her face into an impossible mask like position, literally sucking in her nose until she looks like a bird skull. I am impressed. Now I must transform. I also do that. Jerome is amazed and impressed I am able to not only understand the importance of this experience but am also able to do it. We have earned the right to remain in the hunt. Apparently we must transform our faces to be able to walk up to the bird, as it will not recognize us without human like features. (546 words)

["The dreams fly me."] I am aware that I am in that between waking and dream state. I feel charged energy. I don't want to wake myself up and yet I want to examine what is going on. I am standing on a high second story platform in a huge room. I am wearing my blue velvet dress, A man has something in a box. I open the box and green shapes fly at me and absorb into my body, mostly in my right shoulder, from the back. I am afraid because I realize these things, are entities of some kind and they are taking over my body. I also realize they are dreams the man had captured in his box. He demands his dreams back, but they beg me not to let him imprison them again. They force me to fly out over the empty expanse of this huge room. I am afraid they will release me and I will fall and be hurt, but they are deeply in me and they fly me down toward the group of men standing on the floor. They fly me right above the man as I tell the man for them that they will never return to him. He is angry and would hurt me if he could reach me. The dreams fly me back up out of his reach. Now one of the dreams is the green shape of an angel like woman who is right behind me holding me as if to ensure we can not be separated. She is whispering to me information. I listen, feeling empathy for them. They had been cooped up too long and are resentful and angry. Intense feelings. I want to change something. I wonder what I want to happen. I then scream loudly, as if I were in fear. I wait for the images to transform to frightening things, but they don't. I am kind of glad. I don't know what to do or what I want to do with this lucidity. (335 words)

["Violin sharing."] It is necessary to move the computer. My daughter Ellie and a man I am married to move it for me. I go into the room they moved it to, in some apartment. At first I don't like the new set up. I say I like to look out the window when I'm thinking. Then I see a window in the right position. They move it again. Now I am facing a window and a window is on the right. I like that, except, now the door is partially blocked to the outside. I don't like that. I walk to the window and look out. We are high up on a hill. I look down and see a man walking up the hill toward our door. He is perhaps Eastern Indian. I wait in anticipation for his message. Now the scene changes, and he has brought me to a meeting in a room. He is seated in a large easy chair, more like a sofa. He smiles invitingly and suggests I sit with him. I do. A woman is his helper. She comes over and they talk. I realize this is a spiritual meeting and the topic is violins. Everyone is learning to play one. I comment I used to play one. He smiles delighted at that information. He leaves for a moment. I am seated next to another man who is struggling to learn how to play his violin. I give him some advice about second position, but he doesn't understand. So I use his violin to show him. I feel rusty and am aware my fingers are deformed. His violin is very unusual. It has cork pads with finger indents in each place where you would play a note. They are large and so the placement of the fingers is not the same as on a regular violin. I show him where you place your fingers for second position. On the violin are extra strings and numbers like 5 and 6 with arrows. The bridge is in the wrong place and the strings aren't long enough for all the positions. I struggle with these differences. Now the man has returned. He is seated on the floor next to the couch we are on. A woman is seated to my left. He smiles at me with happiness at my violin skills. The woman reaches down to him and pits her arms around his chest from behind and pulls him up to sit on the couch. His body is apparently paralyzed. It is fat and no muscle tone. Like a blubbery seal. (432 words)

And where is the car? How am I to get home? Then Howard and the other husband rush in full of excuses as to why they were gone so long. I interrupt him saying I don't care that you were gone, it's just that I need to know when you plan on returning and stuff so I can make my plans. I realize that sounded unfeeling and I see his face. He feels a bit hurt. I feel badly about hurting him, but facts are facts. (153 words)

["Strange skies."] I am traveling with Ginny. She is driving, she says look at the sky. She says see if you can find pieces and put them together to see a face. I decide to look for pieces and make Charla's face. I lie down on the seat, my head near Ginny's lap so I can see the sky through the cars front window. Ginny says look for the dark parts. I look. It is very dark. Then I see a funnel cloud, then another and another. I am concerned they will touch down and become tornadoes. But they don't. As I am looking up in the sky, I feel the car dip downhill suddenly and sit up to see what's going on. We are at the top of a hill on a very steep road. We are going fast and I nearly fall off the seat. I hang on. We arrive at the bottom of the hill and travel on. Now the straight road is across a waterway, with the tide out. We see the wet mud on both sides of the road. I say we'd better be careful to note the tide times so we return before the tides come in and cover the road. We suddenly see a shallow sheet of water over the road. We slow down and I am now in my wheelchair, tipping over. The car is gone. I decide to dive in the water to try and save the chair but at the last moment the chair rights itself and I am standing on the road, not dumped in the water. We get to the end of the road. Now we see rooms built into the rock wall. It is a University. We see several young women in a uniform of red and white horizontal stripes on the sweater top and white skirts. The school uniform. We see a cafe and look in the window at the food. We are aware we need to keep an eye on the tides so we can go home. (340 words)

["Competition then deliberate ruin."] I am on a football team of women. We are playing a team of men. We play hard and well surprising the men. We actually win, Now the two teams are lined up facing each other to shake hands and congratulate each other. The male captain tells us we have only 25 minutes to do the individual handshaking and remarks to each player on the other team. Our captain, like Captain Janeway, is supposed to tell the team members but she strangely wanders away suddenly. I as the second officer walk down the line and repeat to each player the news. Then I see that the Captain is in a small runabout space craft. She is recklessly driving around. Then she drives out toward space and crashes on a space station. I see flames billow up. This is so odd for her. Now Worf is suddenly taken over by a need to drive the silly slow and monotonous race cars that look like soap box derby cars at a reckless pace. He causes an accident. I am putting slowly in my blue car and see it, Now the police take him and me to jail. Somehow I get out of my cell and walk outside to the city street. I see that the door to the police station which had had the sign "Police" on it when we went in the first time now has a sign that says The Mind. I realize then that we are on another planet and the aliens are making us do these reckless actions and observing us. I go back inside to see Worf is out of his cell. I call attention to the desk officer that we are out of our cells. We walk around looking the place over, not worried about being caught or harmed. Now that I know, they have no power over me.

["Can't find medical help."] I have fallen off a steep cliff hillside. I have injured my left leg in two places. Perhaps the bones are broken. I am trying to crawl up the hillside to where Ellie is at the top. I call out for help. It is very painful and a difficult struggle. Now I am walking with a limp and with pain down a hall at a University. I am looking for the medical office where someone can help me. I can't find it. I ask directions of the many passing students. They tell me where to go and I follow their directions, only to find another classroom. Now another male student says it is in another building. He walks me outside and points to a sidewalk and tells me how to get there, but I am confused and ask for more direction, except he's gone already. I am very frustrated. (149 words)

["Scary dream conference."] I am at some university at a dream conference, seated at a table. I am working on my lap top computer. I call up some program and now can reach into the screen and pull out real money. Mostly pennies and some square coins, some Canadian coins, and a few dollar coins. As I do this, a man comes by, behind me and is showing some people some aura images on the wall behind me he can see. He says he has some evidence of the murders that happened here sometime ago. I feel a bit skeptical. Then I look and see the image of a woman on the wall and feel a bit frightened. Maybe that is the murderer's spirit. Ellie is somewhere in the background throughout the entire dream. (131 words)

["Interesting house."] I am attending a workshop being held outside on the grass. I sit in the aisle so I can see. There are four of us and we stagger our seating so we can see better. Later I decide to sit on the grass near the back, but I can't hear the woman speaking. She is demonstrating some skill or technique. Then I decide to move closer up front. It is a 15 minute break and I walk up to the front. The woman who is teaching and I talk. She decides to go see something I have at my house. Her friend is driving a pickup truck and we get in and go to my house. Then as we are returning to the workshop, we stop at her house for a moment for her to get something or do something. The driver is driving fast and we bounce over bushes to get to the back door. I am annoyed and surprised at the harsh bouncy ride. We walk up two small steps and enter the kitchen. I stand there waiting as the woman goes in to do something. Several of her children wander through rambunctious and noisy. I look down to see twin white kittens playing with my shoelaces. One kitten at each shoe. I laugh, it is cute. I notice the ceiling which has a mural of sunsets and some kind of fish motif. It is beautiful, lush reds and other sunset colors. I see it continues on into the other room and I sneak into the other room to see. I am now very curious about the house. This room is large and spacious. The next room has a brick floor, a fireplace, and lovely woods. Her husband (like Chris of 7 stars daycare neighbor) is a wimpy house husband and inept. He is in this room. I look to my left and see the bedroom. I walk into it, there are 2 steps down to get in. A beautiful four poster bed. As I walk through the room and the other door, I see a small ramp built. That's good. If I buy the house, it can be made accessible. I walk down a hall, which has railings like a stairwell which opens so that there aren't walls, but open spaces between the banister poles. You can look through to the other rooms. There are many more rooms in this interesting house. I want to buy it. I return to the kitchen. I call for the woman. I say don't we need to get back to the workshop? It was a 15 minute break and we've been gone an hour. She doesn't care. Then I see an old woman (maybe late 50's or 60's) and a man the same age. They are moving into the house. They are strangers to each other but I get the feeling they are going to grow to love each other in this wonderful house. They are using a small round disk to cut holes in something. Like one uses a cookie cutter in dough. (513 words)

["Blocked from traveling home."] I am driving my van. Dovre is in the passenger seat. I am annoyed with her because she has the tape recorder and the radio over on her side of the van. I tell her I want them back close by me so I can turn them on and off when I want to. She doesn't want to do it. I then point to the dashboard and reach for one of the cutout areas you can punch out to put the devices in. I say Shall I put it here? She is mad at me and doesn't answer. I almost punch out the area. Then I look ahead and see a barrier on the road. Lovely tall glass vases lined up, blues and pinks and empty. I pull over to the side of the road. Now what! How am I going to get home to M City, which is where we are headed. I get out of the van and start walking down the 2 lane curvy mountain road. Paulina says You can't park here. It's a no parking zone. I say no problem, I only parked the wheelchair, not the van. Then I remember that I did park the van but dismiss the problem and walk on to find someone to talk to about this problem of the barrier. I see a long line of beautiful glass pieces displayed similar to the vases of the barrier. I keep walking. Now I see some people, and am in some large building. I am looking for the person in charge. I see a large room where some people are. This is some small town festival. I go out of the building. I now have a cell phone and the phone number of the woman in charge. I call her and explain that this is the only way I can get home without turning around, backtracking and finding another way. I explain I am a woman in a wheelchair and it would be better if I could get through. She says I could go back to Sweet Home and go that way. I say but that would take so long. Then she says OK, we can figure out a way to let you through. I thank her, pointing out that the crowds are thinned out now, since it is late afternoon. It shouldn't be too much of a problem. The small town is named Wheeler. (403 words)

["Cleaning up."] I am outdoors at a university like setting. A man points out a device that landed on the lawn. I go with him to examine it out of curiosity. He wonders how it landed and I point out the small handkerchief sized parachute. I wonder how it got up there in the first place. I then see a bar with railings with string or something that had snapped at each rail indicating it was tied to some other device and rocketed up then broke free and landed. Dwight comes over and saws the bar in half. I am shocked and tell him how stupid to do that. It wasn't ours to mess with. He is frustrated and upset with himself and surely doesn't like me saying what he already knows. I call him stupid again. The man tells me I shouldn't say that. Now I am frustrated and upset with myself because I know it is wrong to do and doesn't help anything besides. Dwight walks away. I go into a Home Economics class. There dirty dishes piled in one of the three sinks lining the two walls. I feel helpful and decide I will wash them for however left them to soak. Now another woman is helping and I put the glasses and some bowls in her sink to wash. I wash the utensils. It feels good to be cleaning up for someone else. (235 words)

["Sweet loving man."] I am in bed in some bedroom. It is partially dark. The door opens and a naked good looking man, tall and well built, comes in and gets in bed with me. We begin to make love. It is exquisite. I feel every move and respond with intense sexual excitement as well as a feeling of love. It is mutual. Then the door opens and people walk in. I feel embarrassed and he moves to another bed and I sit in the bed, very frustrated and also concerned about who these people are. Then he is lying in my bed again, only he is pretending to have died. Suddenly, the people are sucked out of the room and across the hall where a hole opens up in the wall and they disappear in there. They must have been aliens. Now that they are gone, I lie on top of him and we begin to make love again. I feel his penis penetrate and I gasp in joy at the intense pleasure. We make love passionately. (175 words)

["I kill Howard."] I am in a room, nearly empty. Charla and I are packing to leave. On the floor are many magazine pictures cut out and each one laid out beside each other over most of the floor. I ask her to help me pack them. I show her how to do it so things are organized. I put the similar animal ones together. I show her three elephant pictures and put them together in a pile. As we are doing this, an odd looking spirit or ghost rushes in through the curtains. It comes at me. It has a round head like a balloon under a sheet. It is attacking so I defend myself, by trying to strangle it. It becomes Howard. I must kill it. I persist strangling it until he is dead. (133 words)

["Howard wants to own real estate with me."] I am sleeping sitting up on a couch. I am exhausted. Charla is up and wants me to get up. I can't seem to wake up. Howard sneaks in through the window. I am annoyed but too tired to do anything about it. Finally I get up. Howard says there is this great deal on buying a house. He thinks we could pool our money and buy it together. I glare and him and say "WE?" in a cold tone. He flushes bright red. I repeat the question. He gets the point and walks out reluctantly, angry and still red. (100 words)

["Flying in my truck because it would be fun."] I am working on a project. I am looking at the printed pages of the galley sheets of a book I am writing. I realize I need to ask some more questions of the newspaper office. I walk outside. I get into my green pickup truck and am driving down a city street. I look up in the sky and see an airplane and think it would be fun to fly in my truck. As I think it, I will it to fly. We go up above the buildings and fly across town. I am grinning in the pleasure of having that power and in actually flying. I choose not to fly too high up, in case something goes wrong. It's a bumpy landing. I gather up my papers and get out. I go into the newspaper office. No one is there. I walk toward the inner offices. A line of people come out, from their coffee break. One sees me and goes straight to the files to get my project. I say, no, this time I have a question I need to ask Ted, the owner. I look at the galley sheet and I can't remember the question. I apologize to the man and try to remember the question. Then I ask how much it will cost to print it. The man says this is a newspaper office. We only print the newspaper. I look up and see that "my dad" is here also. He has an artificial eye, a large blue one which he nearly takes out, yet he also sees me with it. He is very plump and short. At first, I think I see his chest hairs exposed with a tattoo. But I realize it is his arm. Now I leave to return to the truck. I wonder if "Dad" will be there so we can ride back together. He is. A young boy from the newspaper office is there visiting with a young boy accompanying me. He doesn't want to leave his friend. I say firmly, James, it's OK. I'll be back soon, probably many times. James feels OK then and leaves. A young boy is in my wheelchair and my "dad" is at the drivers wheel. I ask how will I get into the van. The boy then realizes he has to give me my wheelchair back and "dad" has to back up the van so I can get in the side door. "Dad" moves the van and I see a small toddler like Amelia out of the truck and playing near the wheel. It was a lucky escape she wasn't run over. (439 words)

["Dancing with a man."] I am in some public place, inside. Maybe a cafe. A nice man (like Gaston) and I are talking. Then he gently puts his arm around me and we begin to walk in a dance like step. It is going well, except somehow we clumsily bump our legs together on one of the steps. We do it each time. It almost throws us off balance but we still manage to dance, even though it isn't all fun, with a bit of tension around the ungainly step. It does feel nice to be close to a man. He gently kisses my cheek. (101 words)

["Ellie is a bad girl."] A man is driving a bus. He and I are the official chaperones for a group of teens. He has been driving many hours and I decide I want to drive, to help him out. So during a break, I get in the driver's side, which happens to be on the right side, like in England. Ellie decides she is going to drive and she sits very close to my on my left. It interferes with my driving and I try pushing her away from me. She clings on. I get annoyed. I keep shoving. Finally, I force her into the back of the bus. Now I drive. Later, I stop the bus so people can get out and take a break. I then see that Ellie has taken my photos outside and have tossed them into the air and they lay along side the road. I am furious and run out there to pick them up. The nice man comes over and picks up a black and white photo of me and another girl as children. He says nice picture. You're a good photographer. I had hoped he'd come by and see some pictures of me as a child and notice how cute I was. But he thought I had taken the photo. I am frustrated. I thank him for the complement and don't straighten him out. Now I am really angry at Ellie and I get on the bus and physically drag her out to force her to help pick up the mess. She just stands there. I grab her by the hair and pull her up to standing and I say to her that she has created a situation where people don't like her, for good reason. If she doesn't change she will spend her life being hated by these people and abandoned by them. I say to her she will have to work hard. She will have to clean up her mess and behave very well for a while before she has earned their respect and friendship. She doesn't seem interested. I grab the rest of the photos and get in the bus. Now, I am watching the scene as if from a high helicopter. I look down at the ground and see the people walking around. I see "me" and the man trying to get away alone together. We run toward a snow field. I don't want to get cold and wet, but I want to be alone with him. Later, I see "me" in the bathroom cooking hamburgers and hot-dogs on an open fire. Ellie comes in and drags me out. Josh comes by and is shocked and upset that the two chaperones are off trying to romantically get it on rather than be responsible chaperones for the teens. We might lose our jobs. (470 words)

["Walking on air."] I am outside a building with cement patios and stairs. Someone tries a new gadget, sort of a pogo stick that glides on air. They fall over immediately, because when they stepped they did it too fast and it flew the gadget right out from under them. I knew what they did wrong and got on the gadget to show them how to do it right. I take slow tiny steps and the gadget is very sensitive and I nearly lose it several times. Then I get the hang of it and am walking on air. I go up and down the stairs, which is dangerous and difficult. I manage it. A tall muscular man picks me up. He is my boyfriend and likes to walk around holding me on his hip as he goes around. It keeps us close and cuddly. I enjoy it too. He walks up the steps with me on his hip. We laugh and talk. He is very strong and relaxed. (166 words)

["Angry at Howard in a new house."] I am in a small two bedroom house. I am aware that Howard still lives with me and I wonder where's he been sleeping all this time. I guess he stays in what used to be Charla's bedroom. I remember it has been years since we've had sex. I am not interested in having sex with him. Now there is a 7 or 8 year old boy, and Charla at that age. We walk outside. The boy must be Howard's son. I am getting into a car and I see Charla fall over backwards, hitting her head badly. Howard is standing there right by her and hardly notices, much less doing anything that could help her. I am furious at him. I get out of the car and pick Charla up, soothing her. I examine the head wound and worry she might get a concussion. Now I sit in the backseat with the two children on my lap. We are talking, pleasantly. We drive to a house we are looking at to possibly move into. We have a real estate agent, a man, who is showing us what's in our price range which is roomy and spacious. We walk in and indeed there are lots of rooms, three stories, and the rooms are large. But the paint is peeling, the colors faded and ugly. The house is old and dilapidated. I realize I'd walked up several flights of stairs. I think maybe that will be too tiring to do all the time if I lived here. There would be lots of work to do. Then I think, why am I moving in with Howard? I don't want to. (278 words)

["Lost my dreams."] I have my briefcase. I am walking hurriedly down a hall to get to a classroom on time. I walk in and see that all the chairs in the back, by the door are full. I am disappointed. That's where I feel more comfortable sitting. Jerome is sitting in the back row. I decide to deal with what is and go to the front of the classroom to deposit my project. I am carrying a skull in my hand. I lay it on the long table at the front. I then go back to the seats and ask if the empty chair on the aisle is taken. A man says yes. A boy had been sitting there. So I put my briefcase on the third chair in and ask the man to watch it while I do an errand. He says fine. I walk down the hall and when I return I see the briefcase is gone. I ask people where it is and no one knows. I am very upset. My purse with my money and credit cards where there, but much worse, my notebook with my dreams written in it was there. I start crying. I walk out of the classroom to find the office where the lost and found is. I can't find it either. I am very upset and frustrated. It would be terrible to lose my dreams. Jerome watches. (234 words)

["Buying real estate on the bad side."] I walk down 40th street, on my block. I see Lucy who has bought lots of property on this side of the block, which is the bad or lower priced part of the neighborhood. The places she bought are run down and dilapidated. I realize it is a good business move. I say to Lucy, Maybe I should buy some too. She agrees. (63 words)

["Reading my class notes, not quite prepared."] I am in a journalism class, hurriedly looking through my notes for the kinds of examples my teacher is calling for. As students are reading their notes to the class, I hurriedly try to find some I made. I feel unprepared. The teacher is seated in a student desk just in front of me. He says sarcastically, Guess you're trying to write some on the spot. I say defensively no, just circling some examples. I go to the front of the class and pick up the microphone off its odd round stainless steel holder. It is heavy metal. A woman student says no, leave it in the stand. I say then can people hear me? I then notice how loud my voice is and say I guess t works. She gets up and sings a song with the mike to test it. I wait for her to finish the entire song. Now I start reading snippets of my notes. The teacher wants personal remarks about the facts we were getting about a story. So I read a few phrases I wrote about a story the teacher used as an example about a person with a disability and how the problem is people getting all weirded out about their disability. I comment it is hard to counsel disabled people who are treated that way. Then I say next is some doodled pictures of dishes, like they are stacked up to be washed. Stainless steel mixing bowls and colored plastic small bowls. I say I don't know why I doodled dishes, but sometimes when I am thinking, I doodle. Then a remark about my father and I doing some activity. A few notes on Mirabelle and working with clients. She has some names and phone numbers for me. The teacher is impressed as I go along. I had lots, even though I wasn't prepared and my stuff is a bit poetic and interesting, not like the shallow stuff the younger students are doing. (331 words)

["Cheating with Bill Clinton."] I am in a room with Bill Clinton. We are having an affair. I am telling him that he is cheating on his wife. He counters with and you?? I say. I'm not cheating. I am not married and if I didn't have the affair with him, he'd simply go get another woman. I am not breaking up their marriage. I'm not interested in having more of a relationship with him. I call my veterinarian for more pills for the cats. I then decide Bill could be helped with these pills. I am trying to get more for him. Then we get in a convertible, red car to drive somewhere. He is driving. I say quick, get in that middle lane. It's a freeway and we are on an entrance ramp. He makes the car leap over one lane to get there. I realize we left so quickly I forgot to pack. I left behind my pills and Bill's pills. Now we are out of the car, in a public parking garage, and walking down many steps. I suddenly realize we are going out together in public and this will cause a media frenzy. I stop and say Wait. Are you sure we should do this? He smiles and continues forward. I stop and watch. A very tall security person comes to Bill. Bill looks very short compared to him. Abnormally short. He is being escorted away, maybe even arrested. I turn and quickly go back the way we came. The police and the media are in hot pursuit. I am going against the walking traffic. I bump into people. I get to a cafe and sit. The waitress is very upset because she doesn't make much money. I offer to let them move to my town and live with me for awhile until they get a new job and get financially more secure. They hesitate and think about it. (320 words)

["Taunting the dangerous man kills me."] A man has two bat like sticks, one in each hand. He is approaching me menacingly. I am backing up and when I get angry at him for coming at me I lash out and strike at the sticks. I knock one out of his hand. This makes him furious with me. He strikes back at me very hand. I know that every time I defend myself from him it makes his attacks worse, but I just can't help it. I feel cornered, trapped and angry. Finally, I strike at him again and he is murderously livid. He pulls a gun and kills me. It was inevitable. Something about protecting my mother. (112 words)

["Unfinished writings."] I am going to write a play or screenplay. I want to do this. It will be fun. It is good to be back into writing again. I then see another script I had started. A movie script. I leaf through the pages, realizing it is good and needs to be finished, but the one I'm starting wants to be done now. I see yet another notebook with another unfinished script. I have lots to do and finally some energy and enthusiasm to do it. (85 words)

["Escaping disguised as the enemy."] Charla and I and some friends are attempting to escape from the enemy. We get out of the building and sneak around the landscape. We are near an ocean. We see some of the enemy in their black wet suits with yellow balloon like helmets that also cover their faces. I am standing next to the barracks of the enemy. One of them is sleeping in his room. Somehow he comes out and decides to help us escape. He gets us the same black wet suits and yellow helmets. We put them on and walk right through the outside compound of enemy. We walk into the ocean and dive, I hang onto Charla's rope and I am hanging on to the enemies rope as he guides us through the completely dark black waters. We are avoiding the underhulls of huge ships and trying to stay in the right direction. I feel lost and scared. We must rely on the enemy's help. He does right by us and we end up on another shore. Now we are housed in a large room. Each group has a tiny area. We are like refugees. Next to our area is a man. I think we are attracted to each other but I can't tell for sure. We avoid eye contact and act cool around each other, but we are very aware of where the other one is. I decide to go to the "underground" store. I sneak around the streets back toward the water. I find the cardboard cutout of a soldier. That is the sign. I ask for some colors. I meant colored yarn I can make things with. I get one skein. Return to the barracks. Bonnie comes in with a container of food. She offers me one of the green beans. I ask if it is snap peas. I take one of the green beans, although they are old and a bit moldy. We don't have much food and that is a generous offer of Bonnie's. I have a container of food also and show her. Some white stuff, maybe potatoes and some Chinese concoction. Now I return to our small area, next to the man. I ignore him pointedly. I decide to be daring and hang up a key of mine on a hook up on the ceiling. Then a pretty and slightly sexy nighty, then another piece of clothing to cover it up. People are watching and thinking how brave of me to put my belongings out there where people can steal them. They then also start to do that too. Then the man comes over and grabs me. We play wrestle, both pretending to be angry at each other, but it is just an excuse to be touching. (460 words)

["Happily rejecting arrogance."] A good looking man is sort of a gym teacher at a school. A woman counselor writes up her critique of the different faculty members. She is positive in her judgments of all of them, except him. She sees him as arrogant and self-centered. I am a pretty woman faculty member who sees those faults and smiles. She is in a shower, trying to shampoo and he is naked, trying to tease her as he is in the shower also. She just smiles and ignores his antics. He would like to be sexual with her. His penis playfully touches her and she continues to ignore him. He's an OK guy but she knows he's only playing and she doesn't intend to have a relationship with him. It is all pleasant and not rejecting. (133 words)

["Hospital rooms and irregular fast heart beat."] I am walking through a series of Hospital rooms. Each room has a bed and a patient and a front door to the right. I am using connecting doors the medical personnel use. I feel strange using this door and am relieved I am carrying a stethoscope so I wouldn't get caught. I see a front door opened in a room with no patient. I run through to the hall. Now, a fire alarm goes off, loud and insistent. I am running. I feel out of breath and the beginnings of my irregular heart beat begins. But I have to keep running. My heart is beating very fast. Now the building is like a dorm. I rush out the building and see remodeling like its been bombed out. I notice the room numbers and realize I am several units/buildings away from my own dorm room. I keep running. (148 words)

["Supervising counselors should have more experience."] I am at some workshops for counselors. I am listening. After it is finished, a woman comes over to me with a piece of paper with her suggestions on it. I read it. Next time, she would like to see some information on having supervisors have more experience than the ones they supervise. Then she has other things. I comment that this wasn't the topic area we were doing. She's more into how to improve teaching counselors and the workshop was on better counseling. The last line was a series of colors mostly mauve and purple except one aqua blue. (100 words)

["Inaccessibility not an issue when not needed."] I am at a workshop Lucy is putting on. She tells the audience to all join her in some small square at the top of the raised seats in the auditorium. Everyone goes up there. It is very crowded. I stay below at an aisle landing and watch. I tell some woman in a wheelchair, like Arvonne, this is terrible to have this inaccessible experience when it is presented by people with disabilities. As I sit there and watch, I realize that if I really wanted to, I could get there and join them if I wanted to. I realize I just don't want to and I let go of my complaints. I tell Lucy she did a good job on the workshop. (123 words)

I don't know if he will smash through the wall or leap over it. I decide to crouch up to the wall, hoping he leaps over. If he doesn't I will be dead. He is a huge bull with long horns. He does leap over and I scramble over the wall to the side he was on. He turns to come for me, again. I climb up a pole which is holding up the barn roof. He is leaping up at me, trying to get me. I am hanging on for dear life. He almost reaches me. I crawl up on the roof and lie there as he batters at the pole. I slide backwards toward the middle pole seeing he is about to destroy the first one and I and the roof will fall. As he breaks it, I keep moving back. I then am watching the scene. I see a woman and 2 kids climb up some stone steps at the other end of the barn. There is a way off the roof. Now I am climbing down the steps. (215 words)

One of them is a paraplegic man. He is very good. Now he rests and my job is to help him. Giving massages and so on. I am doing that. Then another man comes by, someone I know in the dream, and we kiss. This makes the paraplegic man jealous, as he is attracted to me. Then I decide to be a wheelchair racer as well, although I am able bodied. We are racing. He is very fast and far ahead of me. I work very hard and manage to pass some other racers.

["I am the alien."] My three sisters and I are watching it snow. We are standing by a road. Suddenly, a gas trailer truck comes quickly down the road and can't slow down enough for the T-intersection. It crashes into the embankment. It keeps going fast, like it is afraid and running away from something. I look down the road it came from and realize that the aliens are coming. We run, following the gas truck. Now I realize the aliens take over bodies and I don't know which person may already be an alien. I am seated now at a table in a restaurant, and a man is seated with us. I look at him suspiciously. He is looking at me suspiciously and I suddenly realize I am the alien. He recognizes that and grabs me. He saws off my head and puts my head back on and I am reclaimed.

["Weird bathroom again."] I am on some kind of journey. I need to pee badly. I walk down a hill, following some man, possibly black. I step down onto a cement platform covered thigh deep in snow. I pass a toilet, white with black toilet seat, hanging on a chain. I decide I'll keep looking. I am in snow up to my thighs. I wade through. Now the snow is merely a skiff on the ground. The toilet is a rectangle metal grid with a slot in the center on the cement platform. I stand over the slot, commenting I shall try and pee standing up. A rush of urine comes out and for the most part is going into the slot. But toward the end, it starts to dribble down my leg. I shift position, trying to not get it on me. (140 words)

She left them behind. Then his "mother" starts talking about a girlfriend he might go see. I feel a little jealous. I know she doesn't want us to get together. She doesn't like me. Conflicting feelings. I don't want him but I don't want someone else to have him. Then he tells me someone has parked in the Deputy Provost's spot. He wants me to report it. I walk toward the building to do so. Then a man comes toward me. I suspect it is the one who illegally parked and I turn and walk across the field. He follows. I then see an old fashioned black telephone on the grass. It is near where the bad man is. I bravely, but with fear, walk up to the phone to report him and then walk away hoping he doesn't hurt me.

["Ashes, ashes, we all fall down."] I am in a house. I suddenly notice that the sky is black as if it were night, but it is still daylight. I am concerned. What is happening? I look out the window to get a better view. Now I see black snow like things falling down from the sky. I wonder if they are ashes from a fire, or toxic poisonous stuff.

["Camping and relationships."] I am in a car. I am in the front seat, and a woman is in the back. I think it is a station wagon. I look at her and an sexually excited. We are going to have a relationship. She is fixing herself up and fixing the upholstery of the car seat. I am lying down and I feel an orgasm. I press my legs together to encourage it, hoping she won't see or hear. She doesn't notice. Then three men appear at the window. One is my boyfriend, the other two are his friends. He is upset and jealous. He gets in the seat with me and our faces are very close. I kiss him on the cheek, and say, we have to talk. He knows that means its over for him. He sadly gets out of the car. The two friends are disgusted with me, for choosing the woman. They leave. Then I look in the back seat. She is lying down trying to look inviting. Charla comes to the window and wants to come in. I open the door for her. The woman is upset and doesn't want her in the car because she will mess up the lovely back seat she had fixed up. I am angry at her and say to her to shut up! I tell Charla to wait for me outside. I then tell the woman it is not OK to reject Charla. I tell her I don't like her hair do and I don't like the way she fixed up the back seat. I see wrinkled bunched up grey upholstery. She is sad and disappointed and gets out of the car. I feel relieved and free now. I put on lipstick. It is shiny and glossy. I notice my lips are thinned out from age, but I put the lipstick on more thickly to make my lips look more full. I enjoy this process. Now I drive the car a few feet away from the tent the woman and I were going to share and stop at the tent Charla and I will share. A man (Wilbur) is all bound up in a sleeping bag near the tent. I carefully backup so that I don't hurt him. I get out and look around for a place to safely store my wallet and car key. I find a messy used skillet from breakfast and put them with it. I put it in an end table and change my mind and put it in a mattress that has a zippered cover. I know they are obvious places a thief would look, but I decide it will be safe. (445 words)

It seems that my "mother" is actually a man who loves me and he wishes to declare himself. In an appropriate place. We climb laboriously up ladders and get to a top floor to find out the restaurant is closed. I am upset and afraid of going back down. The man "mother" assists me down by a platform like elevator. We go quickly. Then we walk down more halls and find a woman in a shop. We ask her where another restaurant is because the one named "Legacy" was closed. She points down the street and says it is called "Treasure." We go outside and are not walking on the side of an Interstate freeway. Cars are coming at us and we move to get a safer path.

["Weird eyes in trouble."] I am in a room. It is dark. Ellie comes in and I want her to replace the two broken or burnt out light bulbs. Then she brings a bucket full of water for my tired achy feet.

["Counseling the man."] I am counseling a woman who is very unhappy. Her husband is distant and uncaring. She has a miserable life, emotionally, although he's a good provider. I listen to her and then decide to talk with the husband. I go outside to the garden he is working in. I say to him very forthrightly I want 10 minutes of your time to talk about your relationship. I resolve to time myself carefully and be done in nine minutes. I just flat out lay it out for him, figuring he won't take the time to listen and think things through. I say you made her chose between the two things she loves the most. You and Germany. You said if she was to be with him she had to move to his farm and never return to Germany. She did that. And now you remain distant and isolated in your garden. She is very unhappy, but she does as you command. She will die soon at an early age if you continue to deny her emotional connection and autonomy. It will be your fault. He is startled at what I said to him. I look at my watch and see it has been eight minutes. I stop abruptly and say Thanks for your time. Goodbye. I walk out to the car and drive away, but I sense I have made a difference and have somehow cut through his stubborn denial. There is hope for her. (244 words)

["Magnetic building."] I am in an old house. My mother and my father are around, other relatives and Aunt Marianne. I see on the floor small cute miniatures lined up. They nearly cover all the floor space. I start picking some up to get them out of harm's way since the relatives keep walking in and out of the house. I go to the door and look out across the deep canyon to the huge mansion across the way. I watch as a huge platform part of the roof opens up and the house turns like on a turntable. I am amazed. Aunt Marianne is behind me also watching. Then I feel a magnetic force pulling at my body. I struggle to remain where I am, but it increases in strength until I and then Marianne are pulled right off our porch and fly across the canyon and are deposited in the top floor of this mansion. Some clerk type person, very bored is there. I ask them where are we. He doesn't respond but pushes a lever and a door opens and we are propelled inside a tiny room like an elevator. Lovely wood paneling and floor. The elevator room moves down and opens. We walk out. (206 words)

I continue feeling overwhelmed with grief. (106 words)

["Not doing it by the book."] Two men and I are in an empty room. One man is proposing to me. He hands me a booklet I am supposed to take and fill out properly to answer him. It's like a tax return booklet. I think this is ridiculous because I already know my answer which is no. What a waste of my time. I decide to just answer him directly and now to avoid wasting time and emotions. I say to him. I don't want to marry you. He is very upset with me for not taking the time and doing it right.

["Practicing the blues harp."] I am organizing things at a desk. I look in a drawer for my blues harp. I want to learn how to play it. I find many new black plastic ones that are real cheap. I pull them out. I am apparently redoing a list on a typewriter. I then find my old metal harp, without its cover, all banged up. But the sound is still good. I decide to practice on that one. I feel overwhelmed by the amount of things I would have to learn to be good at this. Mouth position, hand position and how to breath, but decide not to worry about it and just play it. I am walking now outdoors and I am a beautiful teenage girl. I am wearing a very sophisticated tailored navy blue suit, with white trim and look very good and professional. I sit down on a bench and play the harp, improving as I play. My eyes are closed as I concentrate on the music which keeps getting better. A crowd gathers around me of appreciative people, many young men, who are attracted to me. I suddenly open my eyes and am startled to find this crowd. I walk away looking for wilderness where nobody is to be able to play uninterrupted. I find a tree in the woods and sit there playing beautiful blues harp music. Later I go home. I am looking forward to telling my "father" a sort of Clint Eastwood kind of guy, being home and telling him all about my day. A young man named Perry from school is very attracted to me but I don't seem to notice him or anyone for that matter. I begin to tell my "father" about the day but he interrupts looking at the dining table. I hurriedly go there with a sponge to clean up any mess that might annoy him. He comes over and I try to continue telling him my day. He points to this spot or that and soon the whole energy is finding spots of dried food on the table and scrubbing at them to wash them off. I am frustrated. I wipe off spilled sugar onto the floor. Now I the dreamer is looking at the young teen girl as her father might see her. Her prim and sophisticated suit is unbuttoned at the top and the bra is revealed. She looks sexy. This upsets the father. Then the phone rings and a woman, sort of a housekeeper, answers and calls the girl to the phone. "Its for you." She says. The girl is very surprised. No one calls her. It is Perry on the phone to ask her out for a date. The father is upset and concerned about his daughters growing up into a woman. After the call, the housekeeper (now me) watches as the two try to continue their conversation. The father looks over to me with a questioning look and I shake my head no. He has said or done the wrong thing. Then I say to him, here I'll talk with her and you watch. Now the teen girl is a TV set on the table. I look at it and as she speaks, I listen sympathetically, sometimes paraphrasing her feelings. Especially in the places where the father would lose it and lecture or be negative. He is starting to catch on. (565 words)

["Improv party at the school."] I am a new teacher at a school and am shown to my office. I look around and see some things left by the previous teacher. I am organizing my material. I am trying to grind up some small rocks in a small square container. It won't grind them. I repeatedly take them out, look at them, and then try again. Finally I understand that the battery is dead. I decide to go to the school supply office. It is right next door, conveniently. I go in there. The two secretaries are busy. It is a regular admissions office, but there are gift like items for sale. Red glass vases, filmy scarves, hair things, and Christmas decorations. I am waiting and looking around. Sarafina comes over and I hand her my pile of things, requesting a return of some films, a new battery and a few other things I came for. Some other teachers come in and now its a party. Entertainment and jokes as I watch the room fill up all around me. A woman is doing her skit and I decide to join in the fun. I sit on the secretary (Sarafina's) chair and I touch her desk, from behind the counter. Everyone is shocked and the woman is very upset with me. I say opps. I made a mistake. Sarafina will be furious. Then I see a silly act at the door. William Shatner and someone else is outside the door and a tiny baby elephant is placed on the open transom. The door opens and I see William and the woman piled one on top of the other and they look up and see the baby elephant step down on William's back. They made silly faces as they all crunch down flat on the ground and roll into the room. I am in the corner by the door on the floor watching and I get all mixed up with them. William and the woman get up and walk away and the baby elephant rolls off me and I get up. It was very funny. Now the party is raucous and out of control. I leave and go back to my office, everyone is mad at me and as I open the office door I see they are in my room. I feel invaded and upset because they don't like me. The snotty woman is there who is mad at me. I tiredly explain to her that what I did helped them. The party had been boring. Not because it wasn't good, I hasten to reassure her, but because it had been done many times. It wasn't new. I improv'd and the energy opened up and now everyone had more fun. They started realizing I was right. Now they are beginning to like me. (467 words)

["Strange charming man."] I am watching two black men in bed together. One is Bill Cosby. The other man is some charming man that is friendly. In his exuberance of friendliness, he is kissing Bill Cosby on his lips and cheek as he excitedly is talking about some interesting subject. Bill slowly becomes uncomfortable with this intimacy which seems more than just friendship. But he likes the man as a friend. Finally, Bill pulls away, uncertain of what is really happening. I feel uncomfortable about it too. It seems that the gestures are sexual in implications, beyond just friendship. Now Bill's wife is in another room. The charming man is with her and being effusively friendly with her as well, although they are not kissing. She is worried that this warmth may exceed friendly bounds and become an affair, which would be bad for her marriage. A white grandmother is also watching and she is starting to catch on that the wife and this charming man are having an affair. A top freezer compartment of a refrigerator is opened. Bill finds opened photo albums in there. He pulls them out to see the pictures that the charming man and the wife were looking at. A photo of the wife in her bridal gown. And other photos. He is also beginning to catch on that they had been looking at these photos together. (229 words)

["Odd woman is hungry."] I live in a huge old country house with a gravel turn around driveway. I am tired. I suddenly remember that I hadn't locked the front door last night. I check. It is unlocked. I lock it. Commenting to a young Arvonne like woman who also lives in the house that I should be more careful. I am hungry and want to eat but lots of the dishes are dirty. Fry pans from cooking scrambled eggs and bacon and so on. I had been trying on clothes. Some summer dresses. A personal assistant like Sharon also lives in the house. I am a bit annoyed because there is work to do but they aren't too interested in helping me do it. So I walk toward the sink to wash dishes. As I pass near the door, I see a maroon station wagon drive into the driveway. A woman is in the car. Looks like she is turning around in our driveway. Then suddenly she walks into the house uninvited. I am surprised. She is chatting in a crazy way. She sees a bit of bacon stuck to a cloth on the counter and quickly grabs it as she is talking non stop and eats it. I realize she is homeless and hungry. I say oh well, why don't you stay for dinner. I have plates of pancakes, porkchops, and lots of other food on the table. She asks me who lives her. I point out the 2 women and say also my granddaughter, Charla. She sits and grabs up lots of food in a very hungry way and is scarfing the food down as she talks. Someone asks her how she's doing. She tells the story of owning a store and everything was fine until the male city council caught a fish and came home early and passed a law changing where the alley is, which wiped out her business. I say it will be dark soon. Shall we light candles or turn on the lights. Sharon says lets turn on the overhead lights. I say I was thinking of the light above the table, for pretty effect. Just then, a single line of maybe 30 or more girls about the age of 10 walk in and are filing around the edge of the room. (385 words)

["Kitten must clean up the mess."] My "sister" and I live in a house beside a hill. Male workers are up on the top of the hill are moving dirt and some of it is rolling down the hill onto our property. One of the workers is supposed to come down and help clean up the mess. We wait, but he is taking too long. So my sister and I go up a rickety flight of stairs up the hill. She goes first and I follow. The second flight of stairs now becomes a thin narrow metal and that we cling to with fingers. It is scary and difficult. But we succeed. We go into the building they live and work from. We ask for Paolo. They say he is out and will return soon. They lead us to his room. I see his big comfortable double bed with colorful quilts on it. I lie down on the bed and look around to see what this man might be like. He has a TV that is sort of a journal he keeps. I look at it with interest, like of liking the man before I meet him. Then he comes in, a big comfortable man. He walks over to the bed and I look up. He has a translucent white mime mask on with odd big blue eyes. I find that interesting. Then my "sister" rushes for him and kisses him. I am angry at her because I am attracted to him, and she always gets things first. I stand up and walk over to the window and look out trying to ignore them kissing. He takes off his mask and tries to follow me. I see a small boy/kitten who throws a balled up piece of paper on the floor. Paolo reaches down to pick it up, to be kind and helpful. I stop him, saying no, the boy has to learn to do it himself. He made the mess. The boy, now a kitten refuses to pick up his mess. I pick him up in my hands and place him right next to the paper. He resists picking it up. Paolo really wants to help. He has a generous heart. I explain that that is really not helping. It teaches the boy bad habits. Then finally the boy/kitten picks up the paper and I praise him and let him go. Now Paolo is approaching me. He is attracted to me and wants to connect. But I decide I must run a race first. I put on sneakers and begin running the race. Paolo follows hoping to catch me. I am attracted to him, but I must run this race first. I run. And he follows. (451 words)

["Working the dream in the dream."] I am in a house at night. I am trying to turn off the lights in an alcove, so I can peek out the window and see what's going on out there. I'm on the second story. The light won't turn off and I don't want to be exposed when I peek out. I try to look anyway, but can't see much. I had had a dream and I am excited about it. I want to write it down. It's an important one that explains what I need to know. So I am reading a book with many short chapters. One is entitled "Propositions." One is written by Rosie McDonnell. It's a sweet children's story of a dragon and a collie dog. I see pages of color illustration of the collie lost in the woods with his cute ears perked up listening for the dragon. It's a fairy tale dragon in the pictures. But now I'm in the story and I know the dragon is going to eat me. That's not such a pretty picture I feel fear. Now I am in my wheelchair going to a store. Anastasia is with me. I need to write the dream and I also need to read these articles in a newspaper put out by Julie Osborne about dreams. I fold the paper and find the pages with the articles but my eye is caught by cartoons. One is entitled, "Two Old Queens." Two women in 19th century dress, young and pretty. I don't get the joke. I find the articles and excited, I begin to read, but interrupt myself to write my dream down. I struggle to dig out the dream book from a bag on the back of my wheelchair. Then Anastasia goes into the store and a biker parks next to me singing a sad tale of his wife Lisa leaving him. I listen as I write my dream down. And apologize to his little girl. (326 words)

["Saving the man with love."] Clark Gable is very good looking and very drunk. He is an unhappy man. I am a beautiful young woman seated at a table in the restaurant next to him. He has a male friend who helps him. We are watching some movie, maybe a WWII movie. Clark sees me and falls deeply in love. He stares at me continuously. I try to concentrate on the movie. I can feel his deep need and love. I am attracted to him as well, but I sit waiting. The other man comes over to my table and talks with me. He is watching our courtship intently. The black maid he is in love with comes in. She sits at our table. He is now intently watching her. Clark says something, a joke to attract my attention. I walk over to him and put my arms on his shoulders standing very close to him as we joke back and forth talking nothings while the body contact and wistfullness is acted out as we become physically closer and closer. Now the black maid rebuffs the friend. He is devastated. I tell Clark that his friend needs him. Clark is desperately trying to pull out of his drunken state and behave well. He can barely notice his friend's plight because of his own struggles and high concentration on his love for me. I am sympathetic to the man and to Clark. (236 words)

["Helping Mirabelle."] Mirabelle gave me a big cardboard box of fruits. Blackberries, bananas, raspberries. Another box had several large zucchini squashes. I decide to make jams and jellies from the fruits. I am smashing the fruits into a pulp. The cardboard box is ripped and some of the juices are soaking out of the box. I manage to make three or four jars of jam. The last one is more of a jelly. (I am concerned that slightly muddy water got into the jelly. Now I need to add the paraffin on top and do the lids. Later, I am at a big farm, near a storage shed. The big house is back off in the distance. Mirabelle and Dwan are off doing errands and I am going through a cardboard box reading and organizing the paperwork in there for Mirabelle. I feel good about helping her out. But I am getting tired. I've been at it for several hours. I now have a handful of small stubs of receipts and am transferring the money spent amount to a yellow ledger sheet pad. It is confusing which one was for coffee and which ones for dinners and lunches. I try my best to record them accurately. Now I see Mirabelle, off in the distance returning home in their car. Dwan gets on a motorcycle which at first looked like a tractor and motors over to see how I'm doing. The motor is very noisy. I am so tired I can hardly keep my eyes open. I see Mirabelle at the house with a small child she brought home to take care of while its parent is busy. She does this a lot. Dwan and another child are with me. She is eyeing me like she is interested in my body, but I am aware it's just a habit with her. I hear really loud music coming from a radio off in the neighbors field. It is very annoying and I want them to turn it off. I pick up a wind bottle, empty, from the box and try to find a price on it to record. I can't see one at all. I ask Dwan to check it out as well. She can't find one either. (374 words)

["Marching as to war."] I am in a classroom of adults. We are studying a play. The young woman who wrote the play is across the room. She asks me if a character in her play is named similar to the title, which is "And Sun Comes" I think about it, wondering if there was a character named summer. But I decide it is a trick question and no characters were named after the title. Suddenly we must go to war. We file out of the classroom. A woman friend and I pack up a suitcase and then decide it is too much to carry and leave it, with the intent of picking it up later. We march down a road. After a long time, we stop. I wonder if we should return and get the suitcase before we get so far away we can't. We realize it is already too far. It would be ridiculous to return to the suitcase and then do the journey again. We march on. We come to a University. I steal a roll of toilet paper and put it in my backpack. We will have to survive on what we find. I hope no one catches us. (199 words)

["Odd quad."] I walk into a room where there are hundreds of knick knacks that used to be mine and the children's. I walk around the room looking closely at them. They are cute miniature toys and figurines. I see a pile of old black and white photos on a table and pick one up. It is a head and shoulders shot of both myself and Rochelle when we were younger, maybe in our 30's. As I look, the photo moves, my double chin flapping as I move and talk. I think to myself that I was much thinner then. There is distance between Rochelle and I. She is looking away from me so that we are both facing the same direction. I then sit down on a couch. A male quad wheels into the room. He comes over and parks on my right, at the end of the couch. We are introduced by a woman. He curves his very long arm out across the room and then back toward me to shake my hand. I am amazed at the long reach he has. I shake his hand but he doesn't remove it or stop shaking it. So We sit there holding hands in a shake hands position, rather raised in the air. We chat. The woman then helpfully leans forward, pushing our hands to gently break the clasp. I am relieved and we continue chatting. I need to go to the bathroom so I get up and walk down a hall. I ask one of my children if the room on the left is the bathroom. She says it is. I go in and try to secure the other door. It is ajar. I see through the crack and recognize a hall and many rooms off of it. I finally get the door to shut and sit on the toilet. I have a green colored BM. It is messy. I try to wipe clean, but it is sticky and I have trouble doing it. (333 words)

["Asking for information about dreams from a well-known author of books about dreams."] I am in a hotel room. I had picked up some special odd looking pictures I wanted to make. I now look more closely at them and see that it is a rectangular picture frame with a needlepoint canvas stretched on it. A saying is already worked on the canvas in orange yarn. The frame and canvas is then enclosed in a mess like cloth. I decide I made a mistake. Maybe I'll take the mess off and rework my own picture of a dream on this canvas. But the saying is in the way. I would have to undo her work (the author's) to do mine. Seems a lot of work. Now I am reading the manual of instructions with it. I see some new categories she has added to her usual list. I read them and think how odd. They seem minor and trivial, not helpful to the dreamer. Maybe just stuff that's in her dreams. Then I see her walking down the hall and I call out to her. I try to be friendly and non pushy but am a bit apprehensive she will snub me because of our previous encounters. She is friendly however and I politely say I have some questions about her dreamwork books, two of which I bought. I ask hr the questions and she responses with some general answer. (227 words)

I see a car with a mural of the mountains on the side windows and a mural of the coast on the front windshield. Ginny wants to go to the mountains and Ernie wants to go to the coast. The feeling is that Ernie figures he will have to go to the mountains because Ginny wants that. He misses the ocean and is wishful of going there. (81 words)

["Dressing for success."] I am in a room. Nate is there. I want to hug him. He starts to bend down, but I say wait. I want to hug him standing up. I struggle a bit and stand up. We have an awkward hug. Now it is time to go to a meeting. Maybe it is a job interview. I am walking, wearing a peach colored pretty business suit with white trim. I feel unsure if I should be now in my wheelchair or walking. I also can't decide if I should button up my jacket or not. I get out of the elevator in a back hall of the office. I realize I have an opportunity to sneak down the hall and check out info on how the business operates and I'd do better at the interview if I snuck a peek. I feel guilty but do sneak down the hall and then decide to be honest. I return to the main reception area which I enter from the back door. I maneuver around lots of desks and barriers and finally make it to the front of the front desk to announce myself. (191 words)

["Man eating alien plant."] I am in a possible space ship. We are growing plants. I discover alien plants among the regular plants. I am feeding them things that look like Brussels sprouts. I am explaining to someone that you have to be very careful feeding this plant because we already lost one crew member. He was sticking his hand with the food into the plant's top and the plant grabbed him and ate him. (71 words)

["Deciding to live."] My parents have decided that I should die now because things are so hard for me with all the suffering I have had and will have all my life. I have agreed. They decide the best way for me to die is to lie me down in a large rectangular box half filled with a metallic silvery liquid like molding metals for statues. I am supposed to lie down and they then bill the box up all the way and I would be totally covered and submerged. I would drown in this liquid and be preserved like a statue. The thought of the liquid entering my lungs is not a good one. I feel squeamish and afraid. Charla is sad I will die. Then I walk out of the room with the box and see my mother, my father, brother Dwight and Charla in a dining room. I join them, saying to Charla. I have decided not to die. I guess I'll just wait until I die of Arthritis whenever it happens. Charla is happy and relieved. I am very relieved also. I can't imagine what I was thinking to even have agreed to this unnecessary suicide plan. (198 words)

["Storms on the horizon."] I am outdoors with Henry. He is looking behind me and comments on the many tornado funnel storms he sees on the horizon approaching us. I am looking behind him and say there are over five of them just below the horizon. You can't see them now. I am worried and fearful for the people caught out in the open when the storms arrive. The winds kick up. An object that looks like a string green bean lands on my arm with a slap. It sticks on my right arm and begins the damaging process. It is like a leech. Henry's wife grabs at it and pulls it off. It leaves a red open wound. She is relieved it was taken off quickly enough so that only minimal damage was done. She had saved my life. I begin to become sleepy and fall onto a bed (perhaps I was carried into the house.) Henry is seated next to me. As I become unconscious he pulls me up to him in a tender hug. I am healing and now that I am unconscious am relaxed about him holding me. I am peacefully allowing the embrace to be positive and healing. (199 words)

["Traveling to France."] A man and I are walking hurriedly down a corridor to find the right plane to go to France. I see a shop on the left and read a price tag that says 2,000 something. I try to pronounce it in French. I have trouble remembering what the right words are but I do finally remember. We find a plane but are told it is the wrong one. We rush back down the corridor and find a second plane. I walk quickly up the stairs. We just as quickly walk back down as it is also the wrong plane. Now we are running to find a smaller plane. I realize I have to go to the bathroom. I look for one on the way and don't find one. I see a counter on the right and we ask directions of the woman there. Then I see an empty beauty parlor on the left. Cute plastic molded cubicles for the client and the hairdresser to be in like basket chairs hung from the ceiling. Then we find the area of boarding a cute little two seater train. Or at least the facade of a train on the back side and two seats like on a train open on the other side. It travels on the curved tracks. I really have to pee and hope there is a bathroom on the plane, wherever it is, and I hope it isn't too small. (240 words)

["Conflicted arthritis."] I am laying on my stomach on a hospital gurney in the hall. I am being prepared for surgery. I already am very drowsy with the anesthesia. A doctor comes over to my right and bends down to look at me. I work hard to speak clearly and remember all I need to tell him. He asks me what I have. I say Rheumatoid Arthritis. He asks what medications I am on. I say Risperdal and Cortisone. He asks me what surgery I am having. I tell him It is for conflicted arthritis. They need to open spots on my body to release something so I can get better. He is disapproving and surprised. He says I should be trying different medicines like a liquid form of what I take first to see if it will help. The surgery is drastic. I feel concerned that I've again made a mistake with my decisions and have rushed the process to an unnecessary risk taking procedure. I am angry at myself. I then decide that it will be fine. I need this surgery. I feel a nurse injecting more anesthesia meds in my right butt. I am nearly asleep. Another nurse, a man, pokes my right arm with a needle. I am angry at him. because he doesn't seem to have any reason for poking me. I muster up all the strength I have to glare at him. He comes back to do it again. I ask him what he is doing and then I realize he is supposed to be doing that, so I apologize and let him do it. I am afraid they will start the surgery before I am properly "out." I tell them I am still awake. I feel a slit being cut across the back just below the neck. It doesn't hurt. It has begun. (308 words)

["Arthritic concert."] I am going to a concert. The auditorium is just now opened and I hurriedly walk to the seats. As I approach the good seats right up front I see them filling up. I go to the next level and the same thing. I ask a woman if those seats are saved. She is rude and says they are. I keep going up, disappointed that I won't see as well. I climb a ladder, chatting with a young man about the crowded conditions and so on. I find a balcony area where some stools are. I grab one concerned I will be uncomfortable with no back rest, but at least I can see. I choose to lean against the wall, but then a row of people sit in front of me at the rail and I can barely see the music group down on the stage. A man with grey hair and a limp sits in front of me. I catch his eye and we smile. I look away and then back at him and we smile again. I see he has arthritis also. A deformed foot and so on. We feel a bond. We are attracted to each other. I decide to scoot forward and am now sitting right next to him, with one person sort of leaning in between us. The door opens on our right and we see close up two members of the group entering singing. They remind me a bit of the Star Spangled Band singer I spoke with. The concert has begun and I am excited. It is fun. (265 words)

["Tornadoes approaching."] I married a man with a number of brothers. I live in my house and he and his brothers live in the house next door. I walk over there to find him. I see that their father has cleared several paths through the bushes to make it easier to go back and forth. I thank him for doing that. Suddenly I am aware of high winds and turn and see in the distance, behind my house a tornado or two. I go into my house and am worried for the children. They are outside in the back. I open the door. By now the winds are ferocious. I call to the children, fear in my voice. They hear me but are slow to respond. I demand they come in the house right now! As I am herding them toward the house, the tornado approaches very close. I get them in and Ellie tries to follow me back out. I yell at her, Ellie! Over and over. Finally I get them and me inside. I say stay in the kitchen because it only has one small window. I say I wish we had a basement! I am scared we will be hurt. Now the tornado is very close at the far left of the house. I looks like it might pass us by. Then suddenly it turns and passes right up against the entire back wall of the house. The branches of trees caught in the whirling winds rake across the back. Now there are a row of windows across that wall. The windows are breaking and flying glass is all over the place. Miraculously we are not injured but it is a close call. (284 words)

We move away from them. I see a huge pile of stuff. Clothes, toys, lots of things. Bonnie and I are trying to sort them, fold them and pack them. The girls are there, running around, playing. They aren't interested in what we are trying to do. (76 words)

I am supposedly at Ginny and Ernie's house. Five members of a blues band are there temporarily, after a performance. The woman member is serving up a dinner she cooked. I sit at the table choosing to sit next to the handsome dark haired leader of the band. I like this opportunity to practice flirting. He is not particularly interested and moves his place to across the table. A large, coarse featured faced man sits by me. I'm not as interested in him.. The woman serves the meal. I look at it. Caviar and hot-dogs (bunched together like bananas) and fruits like grapes and melon chunks. It looks unappetizing, especially the black Caviar. I tentatively taste the food and am surprised that I enjoy the taste. But the look of the of it, and knowing its fish eggs makes it hard for me to relax and fully enjoy it. The woman wants the group to leave today and go home so she can work on her blues singing. I want them to stay 2 more days they had planned on so I can practice flirting. She asks each one if they want to go. They are ambivalent. She leaves on her own and then comes back in. She's singing a blues song and in the song she pops up in the head and chest part of a mermaid statue singing. I also see the mermaid statues head and chest laying in a cradle like part of another statue. (248 words)

["Refusing other people's responsibilities."] Charla and I live in an old house, all on one floor, with white walls, long halls and room after room down the halls. Irv moves in. He is down a long forgotten hall. Charla and I are cleaning up. I pick up a box of huge men's shoes and think they are Irv's. I carry them down the hall, then cross an intersection of halls into the one I'd forgotten was there. I see signs on his closed door saying Keep Out. I see drawers in the wall next to his door and open one or two. I see old curtains and things. I find one drawer with some room in it. Then I lay the giant shoes on the floor next to his door. I return to our living area to clean some more. Dovre comes in and hands me a box with a big plant in it (like the one in Charla's room now).She says non nonchalantly, Will you put that in the room? I take the box but I am angry. I then decide this isn't OK and put the box down on the floor next to the door of my room. I say you have no right to ask me to do that. It is big and heavy and hard for me to do with my arthritis. Then it is time to go to work. We get into a small red sports car convertible. I am driving. It begins to snow. We are in Germany apparently. We pull up to the business door. I am angry at Dovre and am lecturing her. I tell her she has to get a life of her own, and quit desperately connecting with my life. I get out and put up the top on the car. I walk into the business. Again long white halls. It was an easy 2 steps up to the door, but just inside the building is a long flight of stairs going down. I walk it, feeling pretty good about it, but I am concerned I will run out of energy and feel tired. I decide I want to walk with a cane and one appears. I feel more comfortable now, surprised I am walking so well. I walk down long halls, turning right and then left. I find a room that might be my new office. It is room 409. I ask some man if this is my room. He says go to the lobby and ask there. I ask where the lobby is. He says In the front of the building, of course. Like I am stupid for not knowing that. I walk down more halls and find a big nice lobby. (450 words)

["Racing well."] I go into a huge stadium, indoors. Thousands of women are attending a special Woman's Conference. I walk up a long ramp and find chairs in a row up high in the stadium. I look back down the ramp and see rows and rows of already seated women. It's a long way back to the rest rooms and I need to pee. I decide to wait. Signs are being placed in front of our chairs. I then decide to find a rest room. I walk some distance and find a bathroom with a large bathtub in it. The warm water is already drawn. It is a cleansing ritual says the man in charge. I get into the tub. The water is clean and a bit cool. I want it warmer, and turn the faucet on to add hot water. I am clothed in a black spaghetti strap top. Bonnie comes in. She wants to take a bath. I tell her this isn't a bath, with soap to get clean. This is a special cleansing ritual. I get out and put a leopard spotted T-shirt under the skimpy black top. The man tells me I must wear it over the top. I rearrange the tops. I leave the bathroom, still wet, but not uncomfortable. I get in a manual wheelchair. The man tells me the ramp is steep at first, and will be a bit hard to go up, but then it evens off and is easier. I struggle hard to push myself up the steep ramp. I manage to get to the top and see a downward slope with tight corners. Now it's a challenge, fun and fast. I lean into it to gather speed and take the corners like a race car, loving the excitement of barely making the corners with squealing tires. I do well and am having fun. (311 words)

It is a Sunday morning and there is no other traffic on the road. I am driving in a store. I get out of the van. Celeste wants me to take some boxes with letters and maybe a fat laced piece of meat. I walk with these items looking for the van. (189 words)

["Luscious fruit feast."] I am visiting two older grey haired women. Rosalie and perhaps her sister. They are retired and quite wealthy. We get into a small private airplane of theirs. Rosalie is the pilot. We are flying to their summer cottage on the coast. I wonder if we are safe. We land safely on a road. The cottage is huge and has many rooms. Lovely furnishings. I start to walk to the window to see the ocean but am distracted to yet another room. A feast is prepared and one table is filled with lush cantaloupes, strawberries and grapes. The colors are bright and very enticing. They look luscious. I am curious to return and see the view of the ocean. I start for that room again when I notice the entire cottage is moving like a sideways elevator. The landscape is spinning by very fast. Finally it stops and I look out. I see a vague coast line, but no ocean. I am disappointed. (163 words)

["Not much of a vacation."] I had a mini vacation for the weekend and had been staying the one night at a hotel. It is the next morning and I want to pack and return home. I have lots of things to pack. A man and perhaps some other people are there, observing me as I pack. Apparently I am some famous person. I can't find my suitcase and remember I gave it to the bell hop or someone. I dig around under a vanity and find a bag. I am putting clothes in there from the floor. I put aside some old papers with pictures that have sentimental value related to my loved one who was famous. The man watches closely as I hold them aside carefully so they won't be harmed. I continue packing. I see a great many cut fruits that had fallen or put on the floor in a corner. Left overs, I guess. I need to clean up that mess and get the fruits into the wastebasket. Melon slices, strawberries and grapes. I start to scrape them up. Someone helps me. I then put my special papers into a pocket on the outside of the bag I'm packing in so they are protected. It is almost done. I realize I didn't really do anything special for my vacation. Just stayed over night at the hotel in anticipation of going out and having fun the next day. Now I'm not interested, I just want to go home. (246 words)

["Celebrating Dad."] I am in a house sitting at a round table. I think this is my parents' house, although I don't recognize the house. It doesn't actually exist. Just the table. I am living with them or visiting, I'm not sure. I have at least 1000 dollars. I am trying to figure out how to make more money with it. Maybe I gambled for it or just had good luck, I don't know. Now I am outside and my father is standing in front of me. He turns to face me and is talking about the things he's done in his life. I look beyond him and see a long line of relatives coming out of the trees into the meadow we are in. They are coming to the celebration of my father's life. It is supposed to be a surprise for my father so I keep him talking. I think he knows, and is cooperating. Now they are all seated at a long table. I stand at the head of the table and begin a speech chronicling my father's life and accomplishments. After I am done, I realize I didn't ask for any input from my brothers and sister. I apologize to Lydia, saying I was rolling along and never thought to ask them if they had anything to say. They don't seem to be bothered. I walk around. I see Aunt Elaine. I look at her face. She looks different. I think she looks fine. I wonder why my mother hates her. I like her just fine. I see Suzanne who hasn't seemed to grow up. Maybe she is 15 years old. I try to calculate how old Elaine is. It doesn't make sense. I walk around more and see Patricia. Her face is much older, wrinkled. I am surprised. I also see Grandma Anne and am surprised to see her as she is dead. And then Chester. Who is also dead. It is quite the Sanders reunion. (329 words)

["Pulling teeth for fun."] I am holding a circular column of rows of perfect teeth. I seem to be compulsively pulling the teeth out, one at a time. I am fascinated with the sensation of pulling them. I keep thinking this isn't a good idea. I need teeth, but I keep doing it. I am down to the last of 4 or 5 rows. I pull one out of the last row and decide to stop because now it would show as a gap when I smiled. I still want to do it, but I stop. (92 words)

I am walking in the ocean along the beach about thigh deep. At least I tell myself I am thigh deep, but I don't actually see the water on my legs. I see a wall of water on my left about that height. I am picking up tomato like plants and pulling them out of the ground by their tops which look like carrot tops. I then bury them into the sand again and they transform into eggs which quickly change into hard boiled. Then a sort of human being grows up rapidly out of that. It's kind of fun to watch, but then I get concerned that these new life forms will be abandoned and will die. It's not a good thing to do this for fun and then not be there to help the new creatures.

["Beautiful me and no dance partner."] I am at a dance. I am young, slim and beautiful I am wearing a velvet black evening gown, very form fitting. A diagonal line of spangles across the midriff from breast to hip. My hair is lovely. A touch of red velvet in the form of a small evening purse completes the outfit. I stand and watch the people, looking for the man that will come claim me. Several rather ugly men come near and look but turn and leave me standing there. I am relieved they didn't choose me and feel a bit lonely and rejected. I conjure up a man who looks like Robert Downey, very handsome. He begins to look at me possibly interested. In the dream I wanted a touch of red and thought up the purse, and I wanted a man who looked like Robert Downey to be there and he appeared. (148 words)

["Kind aunts."] I am trying to knit a sweater of soft blue yarn. I am making something for Paulina. I look at it and see I've forgotten to follow the fisherman knit cable pattern and am doing a simple knit design. I also dropped a few stitches which created a run. I pack it and several other knitting projects away as I am leaving. Several of my aunts are there. I might even be in Grandpa Lee and Grandma Maude's house. Aunt Charlotte walks with me holding my hands very caringly and is very loving and caring. Perhaps Naomi is in the background, concerned and loving as well. (106 words)

["Ginny helps me improve my house."] It's an odd house I live in. Sort of the 40th Avenue house and yet quite different. Ginny is there and is helping me fix things up to look nicer. She calls me outside to see what she did with the lawn. I step out the living room door and step onto a lawn so thick and lush it's like a well manicured carpet. Near the door she has placed a Buddha type statue. I walk out toward the street. The lawn is a healthy dark green. It is higher and thicker in some places. I look where the driveway used to be. It is also lawn. I say well, I used to have a garden there, but I haven't planted it in a long time. So I approve of the replacement of the garden with this lawn. I look to see if the sidewalk was also covered since the parking strips are also all lawn. I see a narrow sidewalk remaining. I go back inside the house. I look up at the ceiling. Large ceiling tiles are falling off revealing an opaque plastic tarp. Ginny is up there crawling around. I call out to her to be careful. She might fall through the ceiling. I am concerned that the tiles are falling. Ginny comes back in. I look up again and see the tiles are replaced and all is well. Now Ginny is putting up Charla's art work on a high wall. A face of a man and a face of a woman in 3/4 profile. Crude line drawing, but interesting. Then several abstract colorful pieces. She is putting my pictures up for me. I agree with where she is putting them, not being very specific abut where I might want them. (293 words)

["Fighting the man in prison."] I am in prison. A huge scary prisoner, male, is coming toward me with the intent of beating the hell out of me. I come out of my cell knowing he will beat me and knowing I can't win, but by God, I'm going to try hard to survive. He comes at me and we grapple. I bite, poke his eye, and do anything I can to hurt him and fight back. It makes enough of a nuisance that he backs off, admiring my bravery and doggedness. I now walk freely down the hall and down a long flight of stairs to the cafeteria for lunch. A woman hands me a toasted piece of bread. I tell her I don't eat bread, and then accept it, changing my mind. I gather up a plate load of food. I am safe now. (141 words)

["George W. Bush Jr. cooks for me."] I am in my bed, somewhere, sleeping. I wake up to discover George W. Bush Jr. cooking some soup for me as a demonstration of his cooking skills. He is a candidate for President. I ask him at least three questions and he does not respond. It's as though he is deaf or concentrating so hard he can't hear me. I get out of bed when he pours the soup, which appears to be vegetable. I take the cup and see only a small amount of broth in the bottom. I sip it. I can not taste or smell anything but I say Oh, how good. Thank you. He still doesn't respond. (112 words)

["Performance."] Celeste and I are improving some acting stuff and the Uni House women are watching, enjoying us. Then Diane R. and Celeste continue on and I watch. They are marvelous. Perfect coordination of their words and gestures and movements. The women gather around them. I feel a bit jealous and left out, but quickly let go of that as I am so amazed at their flawless performance. (67 words)

["Another sprawling house with many rooms."] I am apparently living with my parents in a long sprawling one story house with many unexplored rooms. I am carrying a notebook and some things that fell out of my purse. I see a photo and want to cut out the part of the picture of Charla. It is a school photo of a group of kids. Their back is to the camera. It is a snapshot. I finally locate Charla in the center and partially covered by the others. As I watch, the photo becomes animated. She turns and is clear to see. I quickly cut out around the outline of her, being careful to cut out the flowing lines of the muffler she is wearing. I get it cut out and I want to put it up on the door of my bedroom. I remember I had moved from my old bedroom to this other room and walk down the hall to go there. I am in a sort of lobby area and I hear a crash. I look to see a small red car I thought was a sports car convertible had crashed through the glass door to the indoor porch. I look again and see it is a small kiddie car, red and convertible. A boy had crashed his car into the door. I call my father who asks the boy his telephone number to call his parents to get payment for the damages. As he is doing that I notice yet another room I didn't know was there. I walk over some fragile rotten boards and open the door. It is a dark musty room with old old paper trash all over. Dingy, square and uninteresting. I shut the door. I see another door and carefully walk along the edges of a very rotten flooring and open that door and see the inside insulation of a freezer. I shut it. Now I remember I used to live in another wing and walk back down the hall. I walk through a kitchen and notice all the dishes are clean and put away. Apparently my mother does the housework and I am relieved I don't have to. I turn left down another hall. I see a bedroom on the left that used to be my parents' bedroom and then I lived there for awhile. I go on. I decide to not explore the entire series of rooms. I'd been there before. Then I look out the window and see I am in a rural small town and wish I could live in the city where activities and art and performances happen. I ask myself if I'd go even if they were available. I walk on down a hall that has become the small town's street. I look in a building and see several children and adults in wheelchairs. I am intrigued and go in to find myself in a weight room establishment. I am happy to see they are wheelchair accessible. I decide to explore this town. I go across the street to the grocery store and go in. Now I come out on the weird handlebars of a man's bicycle. I am seated like in a small chair. He is very close and wrapped around me but not touching. He is very attracted to me and is giving me a ride around town to show me what's there. I am a bit afraid because he's a stranger and I shouldn't be accepting rides from strangers, but I am excited also because he is sexy and attractive. We tease and talk. He keeps trying to sneak a kiss. I enjoy the attraction, but am unwilling to let go and make love as we are strangers. Later, perhaps. We go down a long long flight of stairs that are a sidewalk in bricks. It is a bumpy ride and there is a group of people ahead of us. I am very impressed with how well he drives the bike with me on it not hitting the people or loosing balance. He's taking me home now and even though I am sexually turned on. I know it is important not to leap into this too quickly. I allow him one passionate kiss at the door. (707 words)

["Gay man is my protection."] I am in Duffy's tavern alone. I see Tom Hanks sitting alone at a table. I sit down with him and say "You are gay. He is startled. I then say I'd like to sit with you so it looks like we are together. I don't want to be hit on. I just want to have fun and dance and maybe meet a nice guy. He thinks that's an OK idea. We are alibis for each other. (77 words)

["Investigative reporting."] I am outdoors. I'd been asked to do a small bit in a video promo about disability. Three of us stand in a row in front of a large standing audience. We each have a letter of the alphabet to mime in a hand gesture. The three letters are COC. I am the second C. I manage to do this even with my deformed hand. After that is over I go inside and ask for any odd jobs they may have. A male editor says yeah. Here's one and hands me a note. I am to call some people to interview them. I try and try to reach one man. He won't answer the phone. He is a war vet and there is some mystery. I am also researching the subject. Pulling files out of the file drawers. I notice newspaper clippings all over the floor and see one. I read it. It is the story of a grandfather that decided to commit suicide. He visits his Grandchildren for a last afternoon together. They are grateful for the time with him. They go bird watching. They see regular Wrens. Then they are lucky enough to see a Super Wren. It is a beauty. As I read this I notice the irony of them enjoying seeing the Super Wren and at the same time he's already decided to die. Seems strange to me. Wouldn't the wonders of life pull him back into life?

["Accessibility issues."] I am in an office, supposedly where I work and it is my office. I am seated in my wheelchair and behind me is a water fountain, ornamental, with pretty rocks in it. I go out of the office, down the hall to get to the bathroom in the back room. I complain to the women there that their work materials are all cluttered and blocking my aisle to the bathroom and back. I am annoyed. I get back into the office, which I seem to share with Theodore and perhaps Hank. I see someone has been working on my pretty water fountain. I see huge chunks of quartz crystals in what used to be empty spaces between rocks. I think that looks pretty. I see a second fountain. I suddenly notice that the water tubes are not fixed right so that water is running down the wall and under my chair and all over. The office area is cluttered also and things are getting ruined. I exclaim, upset now who did that! I decide to complain to the boss. I wheel quickly down a long hall and around a right corner. I see a woman secretary and call to her that I want to see the boss. An older woman in a wheelchair comes out. She's the boss. I tell her I have some accessibility issues I want to complain about. She gestures me into her office. She putts around trying to clear off a space to work. Finally, I go on down the hall, meeting one barrier after another. I am getting more and more frustrated. I find a very narrow door way that has those bars in them like revolving gates. I yell, this is inaccessible. A large robot arm very padded, comes through and motions to me to follow it. I say do you mean me? Barb? It wriggles it's hand end yes. I follow it through a now opened area beside the narrow doors. Three or more brown uniformed police or security guards are there. They are telling me that things are in progress and will be better. I am annoyed. Now the hall is a road sort of and lots of cars and trucks and odd looking wheelchair contrivances, Mark H. in a golf cart like wheelchair. He bumps into the rear end of a truck. I am now very upset I am near a policeman and I say with relish, Just try me. This is terrible that wheelchair traffic is mixed with bigger more dangerous vehicles. Keep this up and you'll get quite a protest. I am eager to take them on. I wonder if it is wise to brag so loudly in front of them that I will be a damned nuisance to them very soon. I wheel back to the office to complain. I see someone like Hank and I want to kick him. but I can't because he is 9 months pregnant. I grumble it's not fair, because it isn't even him that is carrying the baby. I look up to see the boss is now a very pregnant wife of Howard. I am frustrated. How am I going to complain about Howard with his own wife, my boss. Frustrated! (540 words)

["Speeches are fun and easy."] I am in a room like Toastmasters with the tables in a "V" formation. I am standing at the speaker's end, making impromptu speeches on familiar subjects, like dreams. I seem to be doing just fine and feeling comfortable. Celeste is around helping. I make speech after speech, happy I am doing so well and feeling comfortable. (57 words)

["Speeches, dreams and writing."] I am in a meadow, standing in a line with Celeste, a woman writer and another woman, making speeches. I am impressed the woman writer is writing and I realize that's what I should be doing. Writing. Celeste is a helping friendly presence that is encouraging me to do speeches, writing and dreams. It feels very comfortable. Later, there is a man, friendly and we might be starting a relationship. (70 words)

["Magic shoes."] I am a young teen walking into a gym. My coach welcomes me and hands me a pair of white sneakers. He says don't expect these sneakers to be as good as the first pair I let you wear. I remember they were red high top sneakers. These were regular white sneakers. I look around for the socks. I find thick bootie type socks and put them on, glad for their protection. I wonder if I'll be able to walk in these flat shoes, much less play basketball. I stand and walk, very glad to see I can move quite well in these sneakers. I go out on the gym floor and join the team. We aren't very good. I am waving my hands saying, here, here. I'm open. The young girl holding the basketball totally ignores me. I go up to her and say why didn't you pass the ball to me? She wandered off. I try and make a basket but it is so high I know I won't make it and hesitate. I run back and forth between the two baskets, playing, and marveling at how well I seem to be able to move with these flat sneakers. As it continues, I get better and better, finally jumping up and popping in a basket. The coach is watching carefully as he moves with me, yelling encouragement. Now the ball seems like a deflated plastic bubble and I can't get it to dribble and bounce. I call out that we need a better ball. Someone brings out a ball bag and I see the other balls are weird and deflated also. I finally find a regular basketball which has enough air. I play better now. (287 words)

["Man resists me."] I am swimming in a swim pool. It is a laps contest. I am doing the back stroke and doing it well. I feel the enjoyment of cleaving through the water and being well coordinated. I am powerful and graceful. I pass them all. I go back and forth quickly. Now I am out of the pool. I am attracted to a military officer who is attracted to me. It is all very non verbal. He is resisting me. I don't know why. I am wearing jeans and a shirt. I put on a slinky white dress with a back slit. Over this outfit. It is tight and I struggle to get it on. I am now walking toward his area. Perhaps a tent. I feel a bit silly, because the jeans show under the hem of the dress. I walk in and he sees me. He wants to spend time with me, but he fights the urge. Now I go up to him very close and ask him what's wrong? Is he married? Why does he ignore me? He is abrupt and walks away from me. I guess I'll never know. (192 words)

["Strange cafe and distant dreamwork."] I have traveled for the weekend down to some town to work with Bill and the graduate students on my dreams. I spend the first night with Nancy and Mary (my old PA's) who apparently are grad students of Bill's. We sleep out in a parking lot. I carry a black purse that I am careful to have with me at all times. I left it where we slept and felt worried and came back to find it. The students and Bill have already gone off to a cafe called "The Bomb" to discuss my dreams. I feel left out, but decide I can find them. First I have to go pee, so I cross the street and go into a building and find the bathroom. I pee in a glass square, one of four in a row. Then I walk up the street, concerned that I am alone and maybe ruffians will come and bother me. I make it to the cafe safely. I walk in and the students and Bill are already in discussion around a round table. I sit at a small side table and try to listen in. One or two of the women students acknowledge my presence. Otherwise, it's as though I wasn't there. A woman student suggests I should see the unusual zoo display. I walk with her and see a petting zoo kind of arrangement. A large low box with animals in it. I first see a calf's head, but no body. It is alive and wavering around in the air. I feel queasy looking at it. I see on the right, a black cat seated and a rabbit on a small box quietly seated. I am aware a pigeon is there too. I look back at the calf's head and see a dirty white glove resting on it's head. Then it passes under the head as though it was a magicians hand proving there were no wires. I comment on the odd bad smell in the cafe. I return to where the discussion of my dreams is supposedly happening. The nice male grad student is trying to be helpful. I need to leave on Sunday and I tell him I leave at :544. He's going to help me get to the plane. (380 words)

["Three questions of the dreamer?"] I am in a gym like room. Bill is conducting his dream class. The grad students are lined up, seated around the walls of the square room. They are some distance from me and Bill is in the center of this expansive floor. A woman student asks me "What are your thoughts on Marriage?" I chuckle and say this is a hard question for me. I have conflicted feelings on this subject. I was married for 10 years. It was not a good experience. I worked for years on understanding and learning how to work through those issues. If a man comes along who can be my good friend as well as a lover, then I would consider marrying him. I had turned my head toward Bill so he could for sure hear what I am saying. Then another woman student (not one of the DreamWorkers) asks me a long question. I say I didn't understand all you said, but I did hear it's something about transportation and relationship. She then stands up and walks right up to me, I am sitting. She towers over me as she repeats the question. I stand up and say please don't do that. I then stand over her as she sits back in her spot. I end up standing straddle over her bowed head. I worry she will turn her head and be looking up my long skirt. I feel embarrassed. I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea. I step back and say that's what it feels like. It's very demeaning. I try to answer her question saying something about relationship. I hesitate over choosing the word person rather than man when answering the question. Then Bill tells the class it is time for the quiz. I sit over next to the nice woman grad student. He asks the question. I don't clearly hear it I only hear something about what will you do if you meet someone at a train and your job is to entertain them and they are boring. The class writes their answers. I watch. (348 words)

["Dwight yanked up into the sky."] I am in a house where my parents live. It's time to fix dinner and apparently I am the only one in the house that does any work. Oh well, I don't mind helping my mother who works so hard. I begin opening drawers to see what's available. I see things have been moved around. I see the beef casserole on the stove, maybe left out too long. I see corn on the cob, in their husks in the drawer. Bread loaves of home made bread also. Then Dwight comes in and now Dwight and I are the same character. He has been grabbed by the back of his jacket by some huge invisible force that is propelling him through the house. He is forced down the hall and sees my father in the bedroom. He calls out to my father and says This force has a hold of me. My father laughs and says quit fooling around. Dwight/I is propelled back down the hall and straight out the front door. My father now believes him and is following trying to reach him to help him. As soon as Dwight/I are out the door, we are forced straight up into the blue sky. Up and up we go. It is frightening. I see a cloud as I look up, then we are even with it and then we are above it. We are afraid the force will release us and we will fall to our death. Up we continue until there is another land up there and we are deposited there. We see a train waiting and people boarding it. Someone tells us to go to the station and check in. We walk into the train station. People are seated around a round table. As we look at them, their human faces blur and we see alien faces. It is scary. Then we turn to the right to hear someone talking to us. It is Dwight in a blue Hawaii patterned shirt, balding on top. We are shocked to see ourselves facing us. He tells us we must catch the train and start at the next town. The train is just now starting to leave. We run out and run with the train as it increases speed. We hop on top of the yellow nose of the engine and the speed is now dangerously fast. We cling to the car as we frantically move toward the car to get inside. Finally we manage to get inside. We sit next to a man who says he thinks this is all made up for us. As the landscape streaks by and we are going up a steep hill on the rails (like a roller coaster ride) we see sudden patches of sky where the land was. It is scary, because if we don't continue to believe we are on solid land, we will fall through and fall to earth and die. We come to a town and get off. The man advises us to go straight to the house in front of us, not turn toward the right and go on into town. We do that, going into the house and realizing this will be our house. We are in the kitchen. I see a stove with the outer structure of a stand up piano. It's time to fix dinner. (558 words)

["A lovely many roomed house."] I am visiting a house I may rent or buy. I first check out the bathroom which is being remodeled. I see a large room, but a narrow doorway. I see an accessible toilet, then when I get in, it is an old inaccessible toilet with a sink over it. The man says he will have that all fixed if I move in. I walk down a hall and more and more rooms are seen. I turn left and another long hall, this time some steps up. They say they will ramp that but we'd lose some space in the kitchen. I walk through the kitchen, then the dining room and then a lovely living room. I return ad see the dining room has only a table and a refrigerator. I wonder why the refrige isn't in the kitchen. I decide if we make the dining room and the kitchen one room, we can fit the ramp. I go back to look at the living room. Lovely furniture, large made with beautiful woods. The woman reminds me that the beautiful furniture is hers and won't stay in the house after I move in. I wonder if then the rooms will look quite ordinary then. I am now sitting in a "room" which actually is a road with traffic passing through. The road seems to pass through my house. At one edge. I return into the house proper and see yet another little alcove room which is quite lovely. Neon art work. She turns them on so I can see them work. (261 words)

["Falling with Al Pacino."] I have a conference to attend. I need to drive about 2 hours to get there. If I leave now, I'll barely make it. A woman who looks like Captain Janeway is concerned she won't be able to fit all the sheep she just bought into her car to take them home. I look at the inside of my van which is very spacious. I say They will fit here. I offer to take her home. Meanwhile a group of students, perhaps like Bill's grad students need a ride home as well. I let them in also. I am a bit mad at myself because this will make me late for what I want to do, but I did it anyway. I am driving and look back into the van seeing it crammed full of sheep and grad students. I shake my head in amazement at how silly this is and how crowded. I let them out and then I am in the back seat of a car and Al Pacino is in the driver's seat. I am however, driving with the steering wheel from my passenger seat behind him. I look up to see we are on a path directly headed for a terrible fall. The road suddenly turns 95 degrees to the left to get to a bridge over a huge expanse of water. I realize we aren't turning. I don't say anything as it all happened so quickly. Off the road we go. I remember I'd done this before in a dream and how horrible it felt, with the intense fear. This time I feel some fear, but it's not so bad. The car noses down and we are falling fast and straight down toward the land. It is certain death, or so it seems. Now the car is gone and we are falling. Al says to me move to where you are over the water. I wriggle around and manage to land in the water. I hit and go deep down. I come back up and swim to the shore, glad to be alive. We get ashore. I run to him and we kiss, so happy to be alive. Now we are attracted to each other. We hold hands as we walk around a long huge high wall of bookcases. Behind the cases we turn and are walking back toward the road. I see boxes and boxes of my stuff. I start retrieving some. I find my dream books and am specifically picking up as many of those as I can find. I want to recover them all. It's getting heavy and cumbersome, but I still keep trying. (442 words)

["Biking with Charla to M City."] I and Charla are going on my bike to M City but first we take a "small" detour to a special restaurant for breakfast. We get there to discover snow on the ground. I have a hard time parking the van. I can't seem to find a place close enough that leaves room for the lift to open. When we get out and get up to the door of the restaurant, we find out there is a 45 minute wait or more as the restaurant is full. We decide to go on. Back in the van, we go sliding down a very steep driveway back to the road. We are on the bike now and bouncing over the large rocks that are like gravel on the side of the road. It is going to take us 5 hours to get over the mountain to M City for Thanksgiving dinner. I am tired already. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. (160 words)

["Finding an office."] I am in a school, maybe like the community college. I have some paper work to do. But I don't have a place to work yet, as I am just starting back. I see Mabel in the hall. She greets me with a smile. She wants to show me her class she is very proud of creating. It has a teacher for each student. A mentor program. I look into the classroom from the hall. A long line of teachers are seated in a row at a table. Facing each teacher is a long line of students. The teachers are smiling and happy to be of help. The students are OK, but not as happy as the teachers. I then walk down the hall. I see a desk at the end of the hall and I feel very tired. I lie down on the desk to nap, since I can barely keep my eyes open. Later I am back up and go to an office that will become mine. Transition time. (171 words)

["Robert Redford and the priest."] I am enacting a scene in a play over and over. Now I see Robert Redford sitting. He smiles and asks for a kiss. I think a kiss would be fun. I walk over to him and sit in his lap. We have a long sexy kiss. I get back up. Robert indicates he'd like to meet me later for more. I agree. Even though he is married. Later I am talking with a priest. He makes some cliche statement from the doctrine of the church. I say to him as an aside (while the entire congregation listens in), isn't that superstitious? Not even faith, or mythology, but flat out superstition. He agrees, a bit embarrassed. Even the congregation nods their heads in agreement. The priest has an idea. He wants us to act out or pursue an idea. But he knows it will mean I can't meet with Robert later. He feels bad for me as he knows I am looking forward to it. I wish I could be with Robert, but I also am interested in pursuing this idea. I follow the priest. (185 words)

["Dream symbols revisited."] I decide to go for a walk. I am outside going down a street. I turn to the right. I want to put an ad in the E City Weekly. I don't remember exactly where it was. I cross a street and say now I'm in the old section, where I had dreamed this scene before. I look up and see signs across the street on wires. I see P and P3 and P Girls. Ah, just like in another dream, I think. I see a store on the left and turn in to it. No, wrong one. I go down one more and go in. I found the place. I see a booth like machine I want to buy to work my dreams with. Someone asks me if I want a drink at the bar. I say no. I don't like to socialize at a bar. Then a woman invites me to a Women's Club meeting. I go in. I am now wearing a gray slim dress, looking sort of 1950's women's club fashion, like all the other women. Then I am up front with the four speakers. The one speaking I suddenly realize is Dora. I am so surprised and happy because she is dead now. It's my turn to speak and I say with deep feeling how grateful I am for dreams because I know it isn't really Dora standing there, it is some Asian woman I don't know, but the dreams permit me to visit Dora again. I cry deeply and sadly for Dora. Then I start giving a speech on my Rheumatoid Arthritis and my experiences with that. I see there are other women waiting to speak and I trail off and hand the mike to them. They don't want to speak and the speeches are over,. (302 words)

I hadn't seen her in there. I apologize to her. Now we go back to the store. The bored woman says too bad the machine is broken. It is really another store that made them and they don't give money back. I should just sue them right away. Lots of luck. I question her more I say well, didn't you sell this to me knowing they won't fix it unless I sue? Then I can sue you. I am assertive and right. She is unhappy. (203 words)

["Three Jewish men and me."] Susie and Tom have invited me to a cafe with them. They sit at a table and direct me to sit away from them at another table, alone. I do it. Then three young Jewish men join me. Susie is setting us up hoping I'll like one and date him. The three are seated in a line across the table from me. The one directly across from me is talkative and interesting. We begin to enjoy the conversation. Suddenly, they get up and walk out. I half teasingly say Is it something I said? Because I don't know why they left. I get up and go find Susie and Tom. They are curt and tell me to return to my table. I do it. I decide I will rearrange the couch and table which had been set to turn in toward me. I turn it around so it will be more inviting for the public to join in. I look out the window and see the three men had changed their clothes and have returned. The one man looks at the furniture change and says he liked it the original way because it was more intimate. I say well, I was trying to include more people in my life. We now walk down the hall to the other room where Susie and Tom are. Now Charlton Heston enters. He has a hand grenade and is going to go out and throw it as there are enemies out there, possibly Arab. I agree to help him throw one too. (258 words)

["Shopping in the library."] I am at home somewhere and looking at a computer screen trying to get some information to scroll up. I think I am ordering things off the computer. Bonnie and Mateo come over. She tells me of a great sale in the library. I want to go but have to put the groceries away first. Then I realize that Mateo had driven the car away to go to his job and forgot to unload the groceries. I worry the hamburger will spoil if not refrigerated in time. Now we go to the library. As we walk in, I see huge shelves with many thousands of books, big and colorful and interesting lining the room. I like it here. Now along the bottom edge of the walls are candles and huge shoes and purses. I stroll along the line looking at the candles and the prices. Some stick candles for 88 cents. Some pillar candles for 1.39. Bonnie shows me a very tall pillar candle. She says that is for the winter, but uses a foreign word for it. I think I'll get one too but she warns me it takes me three months to burn a small candle and we wouldn't want the candle to last to summer when it could melt. I decide not to buy it. The shoes are very very large!! I pick up a purse and look inside it. Not enough room, but a nice shape. (240 words)

More and more keep appearing!. (95 words)

["Not prepared."] I am waiting for the beginning of a concert I will attend. Dwight is with me. I see Ginny and her father in law arrive. I call out to them. Then don't hear and go into the auditorium. I am waiting out in the stairwell, hall. Suddenly I remember that at 7:30, the same time the concert starts, I am supposed to be giving a warm up speech on Assertiveness before the main guest speaker arrives. I remember I left the notes at home. I have 10 minutes and that's not enough time to make it home. I am frantic. I race into the speech room and ask for a spare copy of the syllabus. I find some notes and books on a shelf out in the hall and frantically try to find the ones for this speech. I throw the papers around and some slide onto the floor. I ask Dwight to pick them up for me so people won't slip on them. He says no, he doesn't want to. I am annoyed with him for not being helpful. I am agitated and upset, panicking because I can't remember what I was to talk on. I am already formulating what I could speak on. I'll make it, but I hate this rushed unprepared feeling. I wake up in an alert agitated state. (223 words)

["Falling trees and enclosed rooms."] I am in a small square room with no doors or windows. I am trapped. I worry I will die if I'm not found in three days as I have no food or water. I manage to get out, I guess as I am walking down a hall. A man in a wheelchair is there. He is an old high school acquaintance. Now we are walking across a river on a bridge. I look up to my left and see very tall evergreen trees. One of the tops of a tree is falling. It is itself so big it is as big as a full tree. I am concerned it will hit us. I stop and watch, glad to see it fell off to the left on the bank. We continue walking. I am relieved no one was injured. We cross the river. Now I'm in a wheelchair. I put on the brakes. The man, perhaps Mike P., says don't do that. You don't even know what is the correct way to maintain your chair. You don't even know the way it works best. (184 words)

I say yes, but I have a travel now pay later plan. I am already starting to hurt here and here, pointing out some painful places on my hands. Now I am walking to another room on a narrow line in black open toed high heels demonstrating how well I can walk in heels. I point out that I will be hurting later. I show her how my foot slides over the edge of the shoe at the toe. I say this happens all the time. I seem to be going from one test after another of my physical capabilities. (191 words)

Ernie questions whether I am really asleep and all that tired. He teases me and I have to fight to not smile. I guess I am awake, just too tired to do anything. They let me rest on the floor.

["A screw loose."] I am holding an intricate balloon set up Ernie gave me, perhaps something from the blood tests. I notice a screw is loose and I am trying to tighten the fastener. It isn't aligned correctly and as I fiddle with it, I walk out to the van. I see that all the rocks I gathered up from a creek bed are piled around the passenger seat. But Jake wants them to be moved. So I stand outside the van leaning in and scooping up handfuls of rocks some plain rocks shaped like potatoes and some white crystal like rocks. There are a lot of them and I keep scooping and moving. The rocks are now between the seats and a bit back into the van. Now I get into the driver's seat. I suddenly drop the screw out of the balloon fastener. Lydia comes over and I say can you help me look for it? I point to the floor of the van at the driver's seat to several screws. I say these are big ones that don't fit. It's a tiny screw. She is trying to help me look. (190 words)

["Chopping up the salad veggies."] I am in a house. My mother is demonstrating cooking hamburgers like pancakes. She is doing a running commentary on her techniques. She is cooking many of them, like one would with pancakes for a large group. Aunt Millie is there as well. Perhaps this is a family reunion. I suddenly realize that I should have been working on my task which is cutting up the salad veggies. I find them on a cart and begin to chop the lettuce. Some others help me. I see corn on the cob as well. I am not paying much attention, and my mother tells me to watch what I'm doing. I had tossed a weird corn on the cob which only has the silk hairs all dried out on it. I take it out of the salad fixings and start to throw it away. My mother says no. If you poke a hole in the top kernel here it will express lactose. I am not impressed. Who wants lactose? (167 words)

["Mom's secret."] My mother has disappeared. Perhaps she went into the hospital without letting us know. I am worried about her. Someone brings me a packet of her belongings from the hospital safe. I decide to open them and look even though it is obvious this is her secret stuff. I want to know her secret. First, is a roll of papers, poster size. I unroll them. A series of what look like advertising slogans. I think they are my father's art work and refold them. I can't get it to roll back up right and realize she will know someone looked. I shrug. Oh well. Next are two wrapped Christmas gifts shaped like jewelry cases. Now a faded brown photo. It's animated. My mother is lying on her belly in the dirt and grass of Nebraska. Her younger sister is to her left. She tells her to go close up for the photo. Then she sees, looks into the camera, and speaks to the photographer. "Gladys, stop this. Don't take the picture." She's annoyed and angry. Then I see a picture of a house. I've never seen this house before. A dark brown house with bright pink window frames. A big spacious many roomed old farm house. An old shed is to the right of it and I realize it looks familiar because it sort of the shape and placement of my father's current house and shed. I realize this is my mother's old family home. I see a paper with the word talent written on it. It is fancy artistic writing (like my father used to do.) I now know my mother's secret. She was in love with a boy named Joe. She refused his proposal to follow her dream of being an artist. But after Joe went away, she gave in and married my father and has regretted it ever since. (In the packet was a card, "To the younger Miss V." and a Christmas gift unwrapped. A many colored shirt with very fancy balloon sleeves. (337 words)

Then as a joke, he gets in my wheelchair and I stand up on the back. I playfully tostle his hair. We are laughing and people are smiling at us as we go by. We go down a hall and find an area where books are being sold and food being served. The registration area is just beyond this. I see several women friends come over. I am surprised to see Bonnie there. I realize I should introduce Chakotay to my friends. One woman, perhaps like Julia B., overweight. Comes in front of us and sits on the ground. I introduce her. Then I try to talk with Bonnie and introduce her. I say, but where are you going to stay? She says I'll sleep in your van. I say, in Spanish, to impress Chakotay, that I didn't bring my communeta. I only have the carro. She says she will manage. Chakotay is concerned about her. He wants to help her. I belatedly realize she must be in trouble if she is here. He suggests she sneak into my room.

She is a child again and is cleaning her room. I am surprised at how well she is doing it without an argument. I am in a hurry to leave so I can be alone and experience orgasm. On my way out, I comment on the magazine pictures cut outs she laid in a thick design on the floor. I say it should be fixed down so it doesn't get ruined when people walk on it. I go to my bedroom and get on the bed, but Dovre, a young adult comes in and wants to cuddle and talk, to get attention from me. I am annoyed and want her to leave me alone so I can have an orgasm.

The next morning I get up and my mother wants me to clean up this mess. I say why should I have to do it? You didn't clean up anything, nor did the musicians. On older man, one of the musicians wakes up and leaves. My mother says if you won't clean up the mess, then just leave and live somewhere else. I say OK, I will. I go to my room to pack. Then I not only don't want to pick up the mess but I'm too tired to pack. I just want someone else (my mother?) to clean up the mess. (174 words)

I try a number of different ways. I ask some men who are standing around curious. They want to see my dream program. I ask them to see if we can get another computer or monitor. They try to find one for me, but no luck. I finally figure out how to get the images up on the wall so everyone can see them. But they aren't the right images.

He explains it is free because he had an old high school buddy make the arrangements so we get a special deal. I am helping him shuffle the papers of the accommodations. I notice I shuffle two different piles of papers. I say oops. Shuffling is a great skill, unless you mess up and put different things together. Then you have to take extra time to undo the mistake.

["Ideas flowing."] Lucy and Mirabelle and I are going to see a wonderful exhibit of things from the past. And some art work. We have to walk down a long flight of wooden stairs. We are joking back and forth about the usual inaccessibility problems. I manage to walk it. Now we are in a huge square basement room. All around the edges are exhibits. It seems an unimaginative way to present the memorabilia and art work from the past. There are tour groups going through. Like in the Palace of Versailles. We've apparently missed our group and we walk around the perimeter looking at the groups of old furniture from days gone by. It's kind of uninteresting. Then I see a grouping where the glass vases on glass stalks move I am intrigued because I can see it like a movie director would. As It moves to my eye level I see a round "eye" shaped bowl looking right at me. Then as I move up it curls up into a "eye" shape looking up at the sky. I think this is really neat and keep moving up and down to see the effect. I find Lucy and Mirabelle and tell them of this neat movie director idea I had. They smile and move on. Lucy asks me what I think of my two plays being shown soon. I smile and say I am going to love that. Two of the pieces I wrote and I acted in one of them (American Woman). It will be fun seeing myself as big as a wall. (up on the giant screen.). Then the three of us sit on a couch and discuss what kind of anal we imaged when we heard a story of this animal. I realize that the name of the animal wasn't revealed and I just assumed it was a porcupine. Mirabelle says she thought it was a raccoon. I am surprised. Then Lucy says it could be a kangaroo. I am trying to be generous and say a raccoon is cute. A kangaroo would be fine. What do you think Mirabelle? She says Lucy, do you really like the kangaroo? Because if you do, I'll go with that. But if it's just Barb wanting the Kangaroo, then I don't. My feelings are a bit hurt by this. I try to joke about me being s second class citizen, like a disabled person. The animal story has something to do with disability issues. (413 words)

["Continuing a day dream."] The large Frenchman and I go to his house. It is night. We are sexually excited with each other. A warm pleasant feeling. We might make love tonight. He carries me in and we sit, cuddled on the couch. We kiss and slowly the excitement builds. He sweeps me up in his arms and lays me on the floor. We begin to make love when the phone rings. His job duties call. He must leave. He asks me to stay and wait for him to return. H doesn't know how long it will be. I agree. After he leaves, I look around the room very curious about who this mystery man is. I see old fashioned lovely wood furniture. A glass curio cabinet with pretty things in it. I wander around the corner and see a utility room and a kitchen beyond that. I very much want to peek into things but I decide to be honest and don't. I wait many hours. Finally he returns. We love each other. It's going to be wonderful. (175 words)

["Upset ambulance driver."] I am talking to a young man. We are looking at a large expanse of lawn and a curvy dangerous road. I am telling him that the new road will cut across this lawn and be safer and easier to get to the college. Now we both get in my manual chair to go back toward town. We slide off the sidewalk onto a lawn bank. I am wearing white high heels which makes pushing the wheelchair with my feet very hard and painful. We struggle to get the wheelchair back on the sidewalk. He gets out to make it easier. I am now going downhill and call out this is the fun part. I go faster and faster. Then I hit gravel and come to a stop. I get out and we walk toward the town. Now we are in the back of an ambulance racing toward town. We are observing. A woman is supposedly dead and bloody under a sheet. She met with some terrible fatal accident. But I hear breathing. I'm not sure if she is dead or not. We arrive downtown. We get out. I hear a woman say if you want help fixing up the fire house, you have to buy my two mink stoles that are in litigation with my case I'm doing. We agree to do that. I place the two mink stoles on a shelf in the entrance to the fire house. The entrance is blocked by these shelves. A woman who likes the ambulance driver puts a series of yummy breakfast dishes on the other shelves. The driver comes there and sees this. He is angry and upset. His mother had two mink stoles she would have liked to get rid of and now she can't. And someone broke the tradition of the breakfast dishes. He is angry at the woman who likes him. She is trying to convince him to relax and enjoy the breakfast dishes. Sweet rolls and so on. He is in a huff. (336 words)

["Annoying Howard and the bad gangsters."] I am at a school. I am struggling with math and banking and business assignments. I just don't get it. I am lost. The teacher piles on the homework. I feel overwhelmed. I am home now and I must work on all that homework. It could take all night. I sit on the couch and complain about how I don't understand what to do and how hard this is and how much there is to do. I resist beginning. I tell brother Dwight to turn on the news on TV so I can watch while I'm working. He does it. Then Howard comes in. He wants to watch another show and wants to turn the channel. I snap at him, hey, there are 2 TV's in the house. You can watch your show in the kitchen with the other TV. He is surprised and annoyed. Later, he comes on the couch with me and puts his dirty stinky foot, with black smudged socks on right where I am working. I am sort of wedged in a crack between couch pillows. I snap at him again to get his sticky feet out of my way. He is being a real annoyance. I am angry at him. Now some gangsters come in. They are going to kill me by forcing me to swim in a lake. I can't swim. Now it is Roseanne who is being threatened and I am her friend trying to help her escape. She seems unwilling to help herself. She whines that she can't swim and will die and how afraid she is. I am giving her swimming instructions as the gangsters take her to the lake. I tell her she can float for days and outlast them. She doesn't really pay attention. Now we are in the lake and she has some metal breathing apparatus on and I am swimming with her saying, head out of water, breath in, head under water, breath out. See? You can do it. She struggles. We are going to survive. (339 words)

["Moving."] I am moving out of an apartment and have all my things out now. I had a friend like Anastasia's friends take my TV to California with them and bring it back. This out of the way route seemed to be the most convenient way to get it to my new place. Now I am walking down the city street, like MM City, but not. I am getting tired, walking. The way seems much longer than I thought. I realize I haven't yet given notice to the manager and will probably have to pay extra fees. That's OK. I wanted to move. I then come to a city intersection. I see a runaway truck out of control and it is headed toward me. I turn and try to run back down the alley I was walking in. I narrowly escape being hit. Now the truck needs to back up down the alley I am in. I walk as fast as I can and the way is difficult because now there are ditches with loose boards in them and I step carefully in this precarious area. At one point I look back and the truck is backing up really close and I call out. Stop. I'm here. The truck driver sees me and slows up a bit, but I am still forced to move faster than I can safely travel. (229 words)

["Weird weather."] I am in a bath tub, standing up, time to dry off. Howard, sort of him, but his face is imaginary, stands just outside the tub and hands me a towel. I laughingly kiss him on the cheek. He is smiling. It is completely comfortable and friendly. I look at my left leg. It is very fat. I am surprised because the diet is working. I am concerned. I get out of the tub and dress. The room is very large with hardly any other furniture. Then the walls are moved like sets on a stage. They are rotated to other walls. I look out the window. Lots of rain is falling. I open the door and look out. I see small white moths descending like a locust plague. I am a bit concerned. I go out to try and protect the crops from the moths. They flutter all around and then take off with the wind. (157 words)

["Angry gays."] I am visiting some friends, possibly Jennifer H. or Dwan with their female partner. I am in the house and looking around. I see a very shiny pretty floor. I look out a window and admire the view of the mountains and trees, fall leaves and so on. I go outside and sit on the porch while Dwan goes to the store for something. It is only around the corner of the house. As I am looking at the lovely mountain scene, I see lots of people. Now lined up single file to leave the area. They are all gay or lesbian. They stand very close to the porch. They are angry at me. One man has a stubby ugly cigar and says I ought to destroy your home. I decide the safest thing to do is to just listen and not get involved by commenting back. He escalates his angry threatening remarks. Others join in. It is a tense moment. I feel shaken by the anger but remain strong and do not respond. (later, I wake up enough to hear a woman's newscast story about a man who hates gays with lots of anger in it.) (197 words)

["Big bug invasion."] A good looking man and I are attracted to each other. I am wearing a bright yellow dress with a skirt that flows and swirls. I prance around with joy and enthusiasm. We are in a cow pasture. The man has a cow. And I look at it startled because it can't seem to stand up right. It must be sick. The man and I approach it to help. It falls over and huge beetle like bugs come out of it's mouth. They might be infectious so I prance around and keep them corralled with my feet so they can be examined. Later I am twirling and dancing around the man. (111 words)

["Finances lost."] I'm working in an office. My job is to keep track of the money bag and finances. I have lost both the money bag and a financial calculator (which looks just like my TV remote control.). I am searching my desk and the shelves above it. Everything is a mess. Food had been left out and small bugs are all over the place. I find other things that look like the calculator, but it's not the special financial one. Finally I find it. I am so happy and relieved. Then the secretary whose desk I usually put the money bag finds that. I am glad that wasn't my mistake. (109 words)

["Future."] I am on a work team perhaps military. We have a site to examine. Things to study. We find things from the 27th century. And some earlier centuries. We are documenting what happened in the past. The team works well together. Both men and women. It is a modern space ship interior. (52 words)

["Back to work."] I am trying to get my forms filled out because I am returning to work at the community college. Bonnie is with me. I have to find a counselor to sign the forms and I have to sign them. I look for where the signatures will go and finally find them. There are two important meetings happening at the same time. A women's organization and an all staff meeting. I am torn as to which one to go to. Then as we enter the auditorium, it was decided by others the all staff was most important and the other meeting was canceled. I see Theodore and ask him to sign my form. He does so. (115 words)

["Bathing with Ginny and Ernie."] I am in a bathtub, which is very big, maybe two bathtubs side by side. Ginny and I and another woman are in the one tub and Ernie is in the other. Ginny and I have our bras on but otherwise, we are naked. I think about taking off my bra so it won't get wet, but decide it would be too embarrassing. We splash around and talk. Then we get out. Now we are dry and dressed. I am looking for the right papers. Young people Charla's age are around. A 13 year old boy wants to dance with me. He keeps trying to distract me from my searching of the papers to get me to dance. I half heartedly do a few steps with him, but I am still concerned about finding the papers. (136 words)

["Social commentary with fun."] I am in some building with a group of people. A class or maybe a dormitory area. I am working on a writing project for class. Perhaps I am editing. I show someone how to do it. Then there is a playful sort of skit going on. I watch as a woman plays a seductive flirty woman with this good looking man. I then take over this role. As I am doing it, I make the usual give and take of favors too broad and the director, a man, comes into the area to tell me the woman isn't a prostitute, after all. So I laugh and don't actually solicit money, just car and house and stuff a wife would get. It's a comment on the monetary relationship of sexual relationships. (131 words)

["War and airplane crashes."] I am in a war. I and a man have captured enemy soldiers. We are seated maybe in a building out in the field. I have a hand gun trained on one of the enemy and the man has a hand gun on the other. It is a long night and we begin to feel sleepy. I am nearly asleep and the enemy slowly moves his hand and rests it near my gun hand. I roust up and say We've got you covered. It's a close call. Later I am outside and looking up in the sky. We are in the hills near LA. Airport. A huge plane covers over the hill and I see the huge underbelly of the plane as it is landing. Another comes over and as I watch it try to land it suddenly jerks around and I know it is going to crash. I watch as it does crash breaking apart and into flames. (159 words)

["Hesitant romantic start."] I was invited over to a man's house for dinner. I feel shy, maybe he will want a relationship or more specifically, sex. I find him in his garage area behind the house. I walk in. We chat. It is Conrad. He is making a garden. Then he lays me down on the rows to be planted, and kisses me shyly. I kiss back feeling hesitant and unsure if I should. Will I like this? It is too soon and he will want more. But the kisses are sweet. He seems to feel my hesitation and stops kissing and we chat in a friendly manner. Later he excuses himself for a moment. I wait looking around at all the junk and stuff in the garage. Finally I go out to see where he is. He had gone back into the house, where as I walk in, I realize his wife and children live. He gives me a look to indicate that I should be discrete. I feel embarrassed. Later there is another man, perhaps Gaston who is showing me children. They are going to ride in a wagon with seats that are decorated like flowers. I call them the flower children. They are cute. (204 words)

["Traveling to a party and computer connections."] Dovre is going to a party later. I am walking back down a road to the house to change and then join her on the trip to the party. I decide to not bother and start walking back to where Dovre is. I see my father's VW bug (yellow) on the side of the road and realize there is a toddler little girl in there waiting. The motor is left on, idling. I am concerned and ask the girl to turn off the key. My father shouldn't have left it running. The girl finally does it. Then a friend, perhaps Shannon comes down the road. I realize I had left her behind. I try to make up for it and tell her where we will meet for the party. I have a map. I point to the fossil resort across the state. We get there. Now it is like an Ricardo and friend are going to an important party where venture capitalists may be. I am trying to dress to go there. They burst into the room as I struggle to get my bra and fuzzy sweater on. My breasts are exposed and I duck down behind the bed as we talk. They realize I'd been left behind and want to represent me at the party. I am confused but grateful they will not forget me entirely. (227 words)

["Charla goes to Catholic school."] Charla and I are in a large gym like classroom. I am visiting because she will be transferring soon to her new school. Charla wants to wear an odd outfit to the new school and is telling the teacher about it. The teacher is trying to gently explain how it is not appropriate. She also wants to walk over there and the teacher doesn't want her to. As we are leaving to go to the new school, Charla says she's glad the teacher agrees with her. I try to explain that in fact the teacher was trying very hard to tell her that she did not agree with her. Charla didn't really hear it and thought I had misunderstood the teacher. I feel frustrated. I think about taking the van there but we end up walking. I wonder if it is too far and will tire me out too much. We get there and we have to find a 2nd floor classroom by noon. It is almost noon now. I find a flight of stairs and see no elevator. I know there must be one around somewhere, but decide to walk up the stairs in search of it. I am frustrated and tired and concerned about being late. We get up there and realize the elevator is on the other flight of stairs and now must walk down the church pews as we are in the church area of this catholic school. As I step from one pew to the next as they are the stairs I notice I am wearing black spiked paten leather high heels. Hard going in those. One of the pews is very deep and I have to hang on and swing down, reaching with my toes for the next pew. We finally get down to the 1st floor. We walk down a hall and find a chair lift down yet another flight of stairs. I am tired, we are late. Frustrated. I see an office area. I ask how to get to the classroom. She says Admin./Registration and points to the office area. We go there. I look in an office door and see a counselors office. The name above the door indicates it is testing office. A very tall, perhaps 8 or 9 feet tall woman is there. I stretch my neck as far as I can to see her. I ask where the Admin./Registration area is. She points to a booth near her. There's the admin. pit she says. I go there and a nice sweet faced grandmotherly type woman comes out. Perhaps a nun, but not in a habit. She looks down at Charla and says well, what a very nice outfit you are wearing. I look and see she is wearing a cap like I wore in the 1st grade or younger. But it has leopard fur (fake) in the inside. It is a cute bonnet like a baby would wear. Her skirt is 1950's like as well. I like the woman she is gentle and kind and accepting of Charla. She welcomes her to her new school. (517 words)

["Accepting the dysfunctional man."] A man and I are attracted to each other, but he is very emotionally dysfunctional from all his traumatic past. I work with him and help him be more emotionally healthy. We hug and I say to him, "I'm glad you can visit in and out for the rest of our lives." Meaning he and I will have an on again off again relationship as he dips back into dysfunction and pulls back out into healthy relating. That seems to feel fine with me. (84 words)

["Bonnie won't rehearse."] I am preparing for a presentation. Bonnie is supposed to play a character in the presentation and Sharon is supposed to get the food ready for the buffet. Both show up together, late. I am trying to explain to Bonnie that she needs to have her lines memorized. She doesn't want to do that. She wants to carry a sheet of paper with them written on it. I explain how that will not be professional and besides it will make the show not as good. She just doesn't' want to do the work involved to do it right. Meanwhile I am trying to show Sharon the map of buildings across the street where she needs to go to get the food for the buffet. It is Paul M.'s deli. She can't seem to get it. I walk with her and am still talking with Bonnie about how much better it would be if she'd rehearse. I find a deli counter at the community college and see Paul R. I ask him where the other deli is and he says why bother, he has everything here. I try and ask him how much and know it would be wiser if I went over to the other deli to comparison shop. But I am tired and decide to just go with what's here. I feel bad about not checking it out. He says how much were you going to spend? I say maybe 200 dollars. He grins and says no problem I can do that. Maybe it will be 250 dollars. I know this is coating me more, but I don't check it out. I then go out into the hall, trying to find an elevator to get other to the next building without having to take the long way around. I can't find it. I stop into an office where a man and a woman are necking and flirting. I interrupt them and ask. They don't know where it is either. I am frustrated because this will make me even more tired.

["Puzzles and plants for Xmas gifts."] I am making Xmas gifts for everyone. It is nearing Xmas and I only have one done and am working on the 2nd one. I am taking a long time to find each piece. Then I notice I have the puzzle mostly done in sections. I lift up one section and it fits in, almost completing the puzzle. I am glad I figured that out. I decide to give my mother a plant I find a brass planter and start searching my plants for one to transplant for her. Most of my plants look wilted or not very decorative. I finally find one that will do. I carry all this into another room. I give one present to a woman. I point out all the characters are individually written up. She is pleased I went to that trouble. It is a piece of long big paper with squares, one for each character (like in dreams, I guess.) (157 words)

He is very friendly and I am surprised. Then he begins to tell me all about his business on the Net and how some of these would be helpful to me. I realize he is simply trying to sell me something. I am disappointed. (73 words)

["Am I being prudish?"] Ginny and Ernie are there. I am seated on a couch. Ginny starts to talk to me. I see Charla to the right. She is completely naked. I am shocked. Ginny is trying to tell me that I am being prudish about this. I say but this isn't right. Charla has sexual abuse issues and you are persuading her to feel comfortable about being sexually vulnerable in public. Ernie comes and sits on the couch by me. He and Ginny are trying to convince me it is my prudish attitude that is at fault here. I am shocked at them for encouraging Charla in this way. I am nose to nose with Ernie. He has a round metal tab on the end of his nose like the Tinman in the Wizard of Oz. He doesn't approve of my attitude. I try and explain that this is exactly what I am trying to minimize in Charla's life, the tendency to dress sexy and attract sexual attention. This is a harmful behavior for Charla, I say. They are obviously in disagreement with me. (181 words)

["Watching Bill Domhoff dream."] I am in a house that doesn't really have walls I remember. Just furniture. It is supposedly my mother's house. Bill Domhoff and some of his graduate students are there. A woman grad student suggests I watch Bill Domhoff as he sleeps to see the REM movement. So Bill gets up from the dining table and goes to a bed near by and lies down and immediately goes to sleep. I lean over his face, which is in profile, to see the eye movement. The grad student is leaning over him on the other side. She says see? I look and the eyes are moving. I observe this three times in quick succession. Then the grad student and I return to the dining table where I see a chart with the three eye movement sessions marked. I notice they are each different. I point that out to the male Freudian bearded man in a black coat. Perhaps a lawyer or scientist. He says each is a representative of different types of dreaming. The first one has two lines that go up and down like a stock market chart. The second one has a single line. The third one happens as I look at the chart. I can feel the complexity and depth of that one as it happens. It is a full dream. The 1st one was a short dream and the second one was a fragment. I look up to see my mother in the kitchen. Cooking. Bill joins us at the table. I suggest we go out and have lunch. He must be hungry after his work. He agrees happily. He is very hungry. I am surprised actually because he just ate breakfast not too long before. I go into the kitchen and ask my mother is she cooking dinner for us? She sighs and says yes of course. Isn't she always? I ignore the guilt trip and say when will the dinner be ready? She says around 5 or 6. I return and tell Bill dinner will be ready by 5 or 6. Just so he'll know what to expect. He says great. He still wants to go out and have lunch. So we all go. (369 words)

["Writing down dreams."] I am writing frantically, before I forget the dreams. Bill Domhoff is standing near the couch. I want him to explain his dreams to me. But I want to write down the Bill Domhoff dreams before I forget. He waits. He and the grad student are chatting. I try to concentrate on writing the dream. Then I realize I'd already written down this part of the dream and get confused. I'm starting to forget all ready. I have a number of papers and the dark black ink smudges and I forget to label the page numbers. I write part of the dream and run out of space, because another previous dream was on that page. So I'd turn the page over and continue writing. I am aware It will be very confusing to go back and read it. (138 words)

["Meeting foreign men."] A nice fatherly man is helping me figure out how to do things. He will share his E City newspaper with me if I pay half the bill for it. I agree, then forget to bring my copy for him to read, as I had promised. I feel badly I didn't remember. Then I am swimming and enjoying it. Then I am at some gathering and being introduced to three men. Max, from Japan, another one and someone with a very long hard to pronounce name from Russia. I am accurate at naming what country they are from based on their names and appearance. The Russian is a grump. We are standing in front of a square cart where Japanese foods are on it. The fatherly man shows me how to go from one side to the next and get small appetizers. One bright red thing I say looks like cranberry sauce. He smiles and I say Don't tell me! I don't want to know. He agrees it would be best if I didn't know what the food really was. I see ham slices and say oh good. Something I recognize and like. It is important to do things in the custom of the Japanese so I don't offend anyone. (210 words)

["Take care of yourself!."] I am at some group event, like a conference or retreat. I arrive and my things are very messed up. The children have been into my suitcases. I see my camera out of its case, and papers messed up and so on. I sigh. I try and put things back together. Now the next event is beginning. We are gathering to go down a path near a river. A woman counselor comes over to talk with me. I am distracted with gathering up my things. She challenges me to let go of that task and really pay attention. I acknowledge that that is a good thing to do, but I have trouble doing it. She asks me what I felt when the children had messed up all my things. I (as I continue packing) say I know you want me to get in touch with my feelings and that would be a good thing to do, but I am busy. I am also aware that I am deliberately distracting myself so I don't do the emotional work. Now I am going to walk up a dirt path, uphill. I agree with the counselor that I have options. I can ask for help. I practice calling out. I need help. Then I realize I could have asked someone to come with me and help me, before the problem arose. I walk up the hill, with no help, thinking about things I could have done to have help. The counselor tells me a plane will come to the river and asks if I will be afraid if this happens. I say no, I'd love to take that side trip and be in the plane. But I've got to go now. There's not enough time. She smiles at me. I decide I will examine all the people pictures and this will help me put together the messing up incident better. This will help me understand how I am avoiding feeling my feelings at the moment. But I am interrupted by children wanting to see the pictures, and a man who is getting physically close to me because I am wearing a swimming suit and am looking good in it. He is attracted to me. I am surrounded by all these people distracting me. I gently try to keep the pictures in my possession, but the kids keep picking them up and looking at them. I can't concentrate on what the pictures are showing me. (411 words)

["Everything needs repair."] I am in an apartment. I am looking at the rooms. I see two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a narrow closet like room with a toilet in it. I am telling my mother that I have 2 or 3 of those. It is odd the door is so narrow I can barely squeeze in to use the toilet. My mother gets in fairly easily. The walls are that old bumpy plaster from old houses. In bad condition with bad colors on it. I look in Charla's room and see her bed is missing. I remember she has it in my room as she usually does. Later, I am in the living room. I want to organize and clean. I see piles of things all over each piece of furniture. I am tired of the disorganization. I see some shelves high on a wall but as I look more closely, they are thin old wood boards that won't hold much. I need more space. In the living room, I sigh and say to my mother, I wish this was cleaner. I leave the room and come back in. My mother is seated in a round 1950's kind of chair. She has rearranged all the furniture. I am impressed. It looks like I have more space. There are two dining tables. One rectangular and normal. The other round and black. But the top of it breaks off. Now that needs to be fixed. I see a curtain like a hospital room curtain. I look behind to see what mess might be stashed back there. Not bad. Pretty clean. Now I go to the back door and try to open it to step out on the back porch balcony like things. Some young men are hanging out there talking. The hinges on the bottom half of the dutch door break off. I work at repairing it. It breaks again. The stops I put in the hinge are pink and gooey. I give up, going in, shutting the top part of the door. Then I shut and lock the regular door to keep those young men from coming in. (357 words)

["Dwight needs class in sex and love."] Ginny and I are at a conference or vacation. We have one more night and day to go in this swank hotel. Ginny decides she's done and wants to go home. She sees no reason to stay the last night and spend so much money. I am frustrated and annoyed because I am enjoying being in this swank hotel. But she really wants to go so I acquiesce. I tell myself I must control my frustration and anger for the sake of the friendship. I choose not to, say anything then. Now we fly home. At Ginny's house, I am aware I forgot to give my used ticket back to the airplane personnel. I want to do things right, so I ask Ellie to take me back to the airport and I will try and fix this mistake. Ernie comes through the room and says he's really proud of Dwight. He's struggling with difficult people in his life (his wife Corinne). He is going to counseling and one of his tasks is to watch a movie on Sex And Love With Difficult People. I'm kind of glad I don't have to watch that movie. It might be racy and embarrassing. I try to be proud of Dwight and respect his courage, because Ernie does. Now Ellie and I are at the airport. I remember leaving a folder of papers here. I look to see if it is still there. I look on the top of a pile of papers on a desk. Not there. Then I see a long table where I had put it. Luckily, it was still there. I pick it up and look for the ticket. I don't find it, but I find a script and a wig that I need to return to Dwight. They are his and I borrowed them. Then I remember I left the ticket in my purse and find it. I feel good and pleased that I managed to fix all my mistakes. I feel good about myself. (336 words)

["Dwight overworked."] I am cleaning up stuff, organizing the outside of my house. There is a large pile of firewood in the front of this house. I decide to ask Dwight to help me move the firewood to the side or back of the house. I also want to buy some steel pipes and have Dwight stack them as well. Dwight complains to me that I am expecting him to work and do these things for me without even asking. He feels used. I had never even thought of that as a problem. (91 words)

["Will I or won't I?"] I am at some festival. There is a platform with a roof but only one wall. It is where lots of people are sleeping, in sleeping bags and blankets. No furniture. I am curled up with a bunch of people. There are lots of us. We wake up. It is morning. Lots of people get up and leave. I am still sleepy. Others move away to give more room. I am all alone now at my spot against the end wall. I am lazy, enjoying the sleepy time. I roll over and lay on my tummy. My feet facing the wall. On my left, a lovely dark skinned man comes over. He is attracted to me. I notice I am bare breasted. Wearing only a short pair of cutoffs. I look sexy. He comes over and looks. I am aware he is attracted. I like that and I am concerned. I don't know if I want him or not. He is good looking, but I hesitate. I roll over on my back, exposing myself to him. I curl my arms over my breasts shyly. He comes closer and slowly kisses me. I like it, but I still hesitate. I don't kiss him back much. I think well now he will probably go away since I didn't respond well. He stays. He kisses me again and then I begin to be sexually warm and excited. Then another man, a white man comes over. He also is attracted to me. Which one shall I choose? I am unsure. It feels nice to be so good looking and to have these men attracted to me. Because I can't decide, I move away from the one dark skinned man, whose skin is now only lightly tan. I decide to get up and see the festival. I put on a white sexy halter top with the cutoffs. I am looking good. I walk leisurely out to the festival. This is fun. (326 words)

I look at the neck of the guitar and notice the large wide neck. I try and will it more narrow so my hands can manage it. I go outside it is the beach. I lie own on my tummy in the sand. Enjoying the lovely day. A good looking man comes over and sits with me and we talk about writing. I decide to show him how I do it. So he and two children walk toward my new house which is built in a secluded part of the beach far away from other people. as we walk, the beach trail/road is covered with vegetation and we keep walking through it. Then the sandy road is visible again. Now we are in a car, sort of 1950's sedan. I drive. We arrive at the house and I pull up in front of the double garage to the left of the large spacious log house. Dark rich woods. We get out and I go into the garage where all the animals I help heal up are there. Lots of baby pigs pink and cute, and black and white spotted are there, in hay nests in a row. A baby chick is there. I pet it. The children love being with the animals. The black and white one limps badly from his old wounds I healed him up from. So they have residue problems from their health problems. They are happy and free of pain here with me/. I take the man and the children around to the front of the house the porch is long and wide, a wonderful place to sit and think. I go into the living room where the room is filled with furniture wonderful old fashioned overstuffed couches 3 of them and round oak tables dining tables like Grandma Maude's stuff. 3 or 4 of them. Now I go into another room light and airy and show the man about my writing and music. (388 words)

She finally gets ready and we begin to leave. The performances are just now beginning and we will miss them. I insist anyway. We go to the edge of this indoor water channel. Across it is a performance beginning. We pause to watch it. It is a special effects extravaganza with fireworks and odd creatures dancing out a run way toward the water. A black and white zebra striped animal. Rolls around in dance sequences. Too bad we are going to miss the shows but I have already decided to go home, and by God, that's what we will do.

She brings me an example of her special meals she prepares for occasions she is hosting. She shows me a plate with three hot-dogs spread out like a fanfare of three trumpets. A guest would put their lips up to the edge of a plate where the three hot-dogs touched and kiss it. Then the guest, (a child) would look like a heralding angel. We walk down a spacious hall toward the sitting room. Before we enter, she shows me another plate where the hot-dogs are now a kitten grown and trained to have short bowed legs. The kitten has a biscuit coat baked on so it is shaped like a hot-dog. We are expected to eat this kitten. I feel unsure of doing this. Patricia is quite proud of her special skills as a hostess.

He is strong and hairy, but gentle and wants to help me be relaxed and get my sleep. I relax into that even though I hear the men talking and I want to do my teaching part as I am supposed to for my job. But it feels good to be cared for this way and relax.

["Audience so far away."] I am giving a lecture to a university audience in Australia (down under). It is outdoors and I am standing on a high cliff to speak. The audience is far below. I actually only see small painted academic people in bleachers. The live audience is in the front rows and they are the children of this elementary school. I can't really see them they are so far away. I pace on the grassy verge of the cliff and keep walking over to the edge so I can get closer. I am talking warmly and passionately about good ways to reach and teach young children. I am frustrated with this long drop off and distance. I stand right on the rocky edge and peer over as I speak, but then I am afraid I will fall over. I walk back on the grass, away from the edge. Finally the speech is over and it is time for the reception. I eagerly go inside the building to the room, my hotel room. A woman in a business suit comes in and I shake her hand. I am happy to meet the people I just spoke to. Many men come in. Now the room is crowded. I am conscious of using my best power hand shake and am smiling because It is fun to receive the complements and gifts. Each person brings a gift, mostly books. I like the books. Lovely hard backs on subjects of interest, mostly psychology and Zen and stuff like that. I open a package and find a plastic wrapped set of scrolled bamboo and cloth material. I exclaim at the lovely colors, copper scrolled bamboo mat and dark blue and copper design on the cloth . The Asian woman is so happy I like her gift. Now a man from Australia leans near me. He brought a book to me also. He is attracted warmly to me. I am writing down each person's name and address as I receive the gifts. I make a small mistake and write his name on one line and his address on another one that s slightly off, down one. He really wants me to mark it so I know that the address is attached to the name. I draw a box around them to link them together. He is happy. I ask again about the numbers. I see some numbers there already and he asks what they are. I say it is a shadow of some one else's numbers and mark it out. We are sexually attracted. Now the scene is the next morning and I watch as these two are dressing after having had sex last night. She has a red mark on her breast, like a spider bite. (Like Anastasia's on her forehead.) She says oh dear, I don't remember if we used protection last night. He is concerned as she is. They neither can remember. She says well, we'll just hope one or both of us used something. He insists that if she is pregnant he must be told. She says I will test myself by observing if I feel pregnant. Then I will have an abortion, of course. He is upset. He wants some say in this. She says you don't actually think I want to have your baby? (551 words)

I swim up the long right side, turn the corner and swim across the top and so on, swimming in a square, along the edges of the pool. The coach is impressed with my prowess. I feel strong and capable. It's like swimming in circles in a square. Or swimming a square circle. (173 words)

["My dream program isn't ready."] I am working on my usual DreamLinking, outside on the lawn, and realize that it is nearly time to make a presentation for the high school students. I quickly try to pack up the laptop, the modem, the printer to carry with me. I realize that I should have spent more time in making the presentation simple and easy to follow and use. I get to the high school. They are hurriedly moving things out of the way so I can use the room. I am trying to set up the equipment as the students are sitting there waiting for me. I ask them to move the projection screen to the side so I can see the projected screen from my dream program on the blackboard. After trying to get things organized, I am told I need to move the class to another room. So (I pack it up and we walk down the hall. A man says there's a problem. All the stuff we packed away for her to be able to use the other room is now on the ramp. I then see a dark narrow staircase going steeply down. I have to walk down these crowded stairs. (200 words)

["Charla doesn't like my nagging."] I am at a neighbor's yard, looking at the garage sale items. I see several single beds I consider. Then I find a trellis with a pretty plant growing on it. I buy that and go down the street to my house. I hang it up on a wall of a garage there. It slips and falls, catching on a rough spot on the wall. It's OK there. Then I see Charla has broken the plant up into small pieces. I wonder if the plant will die that way. The purple blossoms are pretty. I am sad they may die. Then I ask Charla to go to the store with me so we can have a chance to talk. She doesn't want to go. I am annoyed, saying fine, then I'll go myself. I walk down the street, coming to a steep downhill with snow on it. I skid to a stop and back up, just in time to avoid sliding down the hill. I turn left and walk up that street. I can't find where I want to go and don't really know what street I am on. (189 words)

I am pleased. Now I am trying to leave the building. I weave through the crowd of students. Another man is attracted to me and follows me.

The man is questioning me. Whose baby is that? I want him I don't answer him. I seem to be hanging on to the mystery as it makes him more interested.

["V. house remodeled."] I am in a house that seems to be a remodeled and enlarged version of the V. house in A City. I think Susie owns the house. I go into the bathroom and comment that the toilet has been moved and shelves added but it is the same configuration as the original. I look in a mirror and am startled that I don't see me. I see Susie's reflection. Only it doesn't look like her either. Dark short hair, greenish blue eyes. I see this reflection several different places and am confused as to why this is my reflection. Now I go from room to room looking at the changes. Now I think the house is Aunt Millie's. The rooms are light, large and airy. Book lined walls. I go outside and come toward the house down the dirt driveway. On the right I see expansive fields, well cultivated and a row of filbert trees along the driveway. They are in bloom. This is what's left of the filbert orchard. I see the front of the house and a long wing expanding from it. I walk along the edge of the wing exclaiming on the lovely patterns in the stone wall. I see large windows and bookshelves behind glass. Old antique books, lovely to look at. At the end of the wing I even see bookshelves with books on it outside. I say they must be old unwanted books if they are left out in the weather. I am very impressed with Millie's remodeling of the old house. (258 words)

["Helping man dies attempting to save the other."] I am watching a woman (me) painting the wall an off white color. All the pictures, many of them, just like my photos are on my bedroom wall, are still up and she is painting between and around them. I think that's stupid. She will regret it later. Then she starts on the next wall and I see a mirror with a reflection of her previous room she painted. I see her husband also there painting, but she had allowed him to sleep in even though she herself is very tired. Three rooms are done like that. She notices she accidentally painted on hardwood windowsills. She decides to wipe it off before it ruins the natural look of the wood. She tries to hide the paint covered paper towel she used to wipe it off so her husband won't be upset with her. Then she sits, tired and he comes to her and tells her to finish. She says she needs a smaller brush for the trim. He shrugs and says go get one at the corner market. She doesn't want to. She doesn't answer as her attention is caught by a man standing on the edge of a roof across the way. She sees him through the window. Then she sees to of them. One is trying to kill himself by jumping, the other one is trying to save him by catching his arm and holding on to him. Several times the man jumps and the other catches him, each time it is scary and she gasps. She is irresistibly drawn to the window to see the whole thing. She wonders why, as she would hate to actually see him splatter on the ground and die. On the third jump, the second man loses his grip and the other man falls to his death. The woman gasps, turns away and cries deeply at the tragedy. Because as the one man jumped to his death, it caught the other man off guard and he too fell to his death. It is ironic and tragic. She cries and cries. (348 words)

["Student cries rape."] I am a teacher in a middle school. My class is large and noisy. Another woman teacher left her class and is sitting in on mine, for the fun of it.

I check my lesson plans. Looks like English lessons. The work "is" is being examined. I try to call them to order. The woman teacher is as noisy and disruptive as the girls. I call her to order and she smiles and quiets down. Now I ask one of the girls to do a speech. I decide this is speech class. She can't think of anything to talk about. I suggest she wait and let it come. Well, suddenly she begins to sob and tell us the story of her rape. She is a black girl now. I feel great sympathy. I go to her and hold her caringly and hug her, rocking back and forth. I feel sadness for her and I feel proud that she is talking about it. (198 words)

["Uncaring distant people."] I am in a huge gymnasium. A man and a woman are walking across the floor. Their cobra is with them, slithering with her head up high and hood extended. She is huge and impressive and scary. Now I see the man and a woman sitting together on the top bleachers. It is night and they are sleeping. A metal basket with a lid sits beside them maybe a few feet away. Inside that is a huge cobra. There are electronic red lights flashing on the lid. There is a mean man out on the gym floor the snake is afraid of. She stays inside the basket even though it is overheating and she is dangerously overheated. The couple decide they want to make love. There is some hesitation because the snake is near, but they decide to do it anyway. Later, I am on a couch on the gym floor with this cold distant man. He is going to stimulate me to orgasm. He impassively sticks his finger up my vagina and moves it around. I concentrate of the feeling and go for orgasm. It is devoid of loving feelings. Now I see some disk jockeys in a room. The man is one of them. He is lying on the floor writhing around in emotional agony. Silently. Another man says well, it is better this way than if he screams. The door suddenly opens and the cold man's father, "Big Daddy" comes in. He gives the man a left over peanut butter sandwich, even though he just came from a sumptuous feast himself. He then hands him an old pair of his pants, way too huge for the man. I use red thread and sew some stitches on the waistband to try and make it a better fit for the man. (302 words)

Then I see the nice man I'd been flirting with had moved a chair there for me. I sit. He is seated on my left. We chat pleasantly, still flirting. I feel slightly uncomfortable and point to a picture of Woody in the newspaper and say My new husband is this man. This is to alert the man I am married and I am proud of the fact.

["Lucid dream about dreams meaning."] I am at a big computer machine. It has flashing lights and lots of buttons. There are two machines now. I used to only work with one. I am getting close to finishing the project. Now one machine sort of becomes a vehicle. A VW bus. I am trying to drive it up a hill. The road is like the rumpled bed covers, quilts. I am having a hard time getting on that road. It is all uphill and not very solid. I finally get the bus on the road. I beep the horn. It sounds like a regular car horn. I beep again. It has a different sound. Finally it beeps a vw sound. It is a struggle to get to the top of the hill. Now I get out of the bus and start walking down a flight of stairs. I am indoors now in a stairwell. It is wide and roomy, with occasional open doors leading into rooms. I am looking for one for me to live in. I walk many flights around and around down and down. I get to the basement. A large old dilapidated room. I am not impressed with it. People are sitting around on old couches. I suddenly realize it is a dream. I can change things or do what I want. I decide to ask these people what do dreams mean. I do so. The people seem stupid. One woman mumbles the community college. Several others slowly mumble something I can't understand. One says "27." Then two more sentences that excite me because maybe this really is the meanings. But I forget what he said immediately. I desperately try to write them down so I won't forget them. Can't find anything to write with. (293 words)

["Can't read the feedback."] Judy P. sends me a big envelope. I open it to find she has after all these years returned scripts I had given her to critique. I am excited. I see she has written lots on the front covers. I try to read them. I can't make it out. I think it's too dark in the room, or my eyes are going bad from old age. I see some spots of sunlight on the bed and move the script there so it would be brighter. That doesn't work either. I see one script is called "Hughley's" and another one is about penguins. I see she has tried to illustrate the penguin story. I see penguins with pink crayon on them. the word "Cold" is there. It is winter and it is cold.

["Quilts."] I find some quilts and remember that I had made them a long time ago. One has autographs and sayings written on the back. I look closely and see that I had asked people who had used the quilt to sign the quilt with comments. I look at them trying to see what they said. I am in a large nearly empty room. A young girl, maybe Caroline as a child is there. She is crying. I say to her sympathetically, come here and I will hug you. She shakes her head no and walks away from me turning her body away from me. She doesn't want to be hugged. I respect that and continue sitting on the floor, watching her. I say again Can I hug you? She nods her head sadly and walks hesitantly into my embrace. We hug for a long time. Then she moves to indicate she is done and I release her. Then I stand and I am dancing contact improv. I pick up a small boy in my arms like he is a puppy. I balance him and dance slowly around. He wants down and I put him on the floor sill curled up in a fetal ball position. A man is outside the open door and wants me to go out there on the porch with him. I go outside in the bright sunlight. (231 words)

["Volcano and swimming."] I am near S City. There is a very steep mountain across the large body of water. And a back murky pond and a narrow channel of water near a house. I think the house is supposedly my parents'. I drove there in my van. My job is to be prepared if the volcano on the mountain blows. I must pack my own things, get them into the van and drive to safety. So I don't really unpack. I just use what I need and put it back in the suitcase. I seem to swim a lot. I dive into the back pond and swim laps. It feels good to be exercising. I swim up the narrow channel as well. I see under a board like a shed wall with a gap at the bottom and see a cat looking back at me. I had wondered what the other person had been looking at. The channel narrows so much and gets so shallow I am practically swimming in mud. It empties out into the large body of water. I think about swimming out there but the water looks rough. Then I see the volcano has erupted. Spewing red lava down the mountain side. I am wondering just how many miles the lava can go. I can't decide if it is safe to stay here or if we should flee. I keep looking at the lava flow. Lots of steam in various parts of the mountain. I decide it is better to flee. I walk to the van and get in. I drive away. (263 words)

I feel embarrassed hoping I am not noisy or stinky, but in general am OK about this situation. I wipe myself being careful not to expose myself as I do. And get up, closing the lid on the toilet. Then the woman says she is going to serve the pancakes now to the group waiting outside. She asks me to continue cooking more pancakes. I say yes and pick up the spatula. I turn the pancakes over, having fun doing it with flair. The man chuckles and enjoys how well I flip the pancakes. (160 words)

They want the job and are trying to sell it to me. Then I notice my eyeglasses are shattered, like a windshield on a car. I am amazed I can still see well even though the damage is great. I look up to see the rehearsal has moved onto the stage area. Charla and I go there. I can't seem to get with them to rehearse. I tell Charla she can come along and be a part of it.

I am surprised I am taking this much initiative in making it happen. Again the door jiggles. Like someone is trying to come in. He then says we can't make love right now. He gently explains that we would have a dual relationship and it wouldn't be OK. He has to think about it. I understand but I am disappointed. I want to make love to him. I like him as well as being sexually interested. We get up and dress. We kiss gently. I walk down the hall to my dorm room. I go in and lock the door. It is the middle of the night.

I let the moment go and continue through the doors. I am looking for Lucy who is going to teach us a dance choreograph to an old rock and roll song. I am upset with myself that I let the moment pass and now I won't ever see the young man again. Lucy is there now with several other people who will dance. She begins to show us the steps. We have to lie on our tummies on the floor and then rock back up on our knees, pushing up with our hands. I groan and say I can't do this. But I somehow manage. Then the young man joins us. I am happy to see him. He is intensely glad to see me. He asks me again if I will have dinner with him. I say yes, I ordinarily don't do dinner but I will this once. He is glad. He whispers after this rehearsal can we hang out and talk? I agree. Now the dance is over. Someone says the music is from 1951 and I say laughing I know it well. I was there, after all. I wonder if the young man will be upset with my being that old. He doesn't care. A second young man is now jealous about the new one. He demands to know who he is and what he is to me. I am embarrassed to answer it. I make a joke and say well, I know he is barefoot. I look at his feet. The 2nd man says well, that means it's sexual. I chuckle and say everything could mean its sexual if we want it to. Now the 2nd man introduces me to a young woman. He is pointing out scars she has on her mouth and face from being beat up. She opens her mouth wide and I see a large stack of children books in there with scars on them. I say to the woman so, is your boyfriend beating you up? She is scared and shocked. She transforms into a round blue broach and a rock under a chair. She mumbles that yes, her boyfriend is beating her up. I continue to talk with her like a counselor. The 1st man gets on his knees to lean near the broach to talk with her. Now I tenderly pick her up. She is several rocks now. One in the shape of a red winged black bird and another is an amethyst crystal. I talk to her soothingly. Lucy says to me, that's the way too do it. Good for you. (500 words)

["Spies in the office."] I am in an office building. A man (like the young man of Uni house who wanted to seduce me) is coming to steal something important. I am setting up a trap to capture him. I enlist the help of several people. I have one hiding in a closet. He is eating M and M's and trying to stay awake. At the last moment, a woman employee goes in to talk with the woman boss. I signal her not to tell anything. She doesn't understand and wants to tell the boss. I hiss at her and say in a tense whisper, Do not say anything. That's an order. I suspect the boss is in on the theft plot. I demand the employee come out to the hall and I explain to her in a conspirator whisper that I suspect the boss. The employee is shocked and thinks I'm crazy. (149 words)

["Dancing lessons, kittens and jewelry."] I am in a building. Some man is giving me dancing lessons. He belongs to a group of people who learn dances, like a Toastmaster's group. He shows me the steps. Toe first, heel second on right foot and the reverse on the left foot. I follow along. Then he holds me close to guide me in the dance. I catch on after some mistakes. I enjoy dancing close. Now Ginny is there and she and I are walking up some stairs. Kittens are kept there. It's like a animal shelter for stray kittens. There are many of them. I pet them and play with them. Some are brown tiger striped kitties. One is white and black spots. I put that one in a paper bag to take home. It is cute. I peek in to see if it's OK. I am worried they will be neglected. Now I find some jewelry of mine I haven't seen for a long time. Beaded necklaces, and so on. I wrap the necklaces around my finger and make a big ring out of it. I enjoy seeing the jewelry again. Maybe I should wear them more often. The dancing man watches. (198 words)

["Retiring from teaching."] I am retiring from teaching at an elementary school. It is an assembly where the kids are all seated. Some still coming in. The kids are singing and speaking about how they will miss me. One boy crawls up on my lap and we hug. Then I release him to his playmates. I get in front of the audience and tell them goodbye. I shall miss them very much. Even though I am retired, I will come and visit them and do some activities with them. I think I am going to Hawaii. I feel like crying but I also feel happy. Lots of love going both ways. (108 words)

["Velvet yellow and green keys on accordion."] I am on a bus like a city bus. With family (only I don't know these people in real life.) The bus is very crowded. Many people crowd on. My mother has to stand. Dovre is there. A small girl who is mentally retarded and is related is there. I see "video" pictures of family gatherings. I see my face all angry and upset because she leaned on me and it hurt. I see some other similar scenes of unhappy people at family gatherings. I comment that oh well, sometimes it happens. No family is perfect. Life goes on. The girl wants my attention and I reluctantly give it. I am standing up and amazed I can do so without pain. I am starting to feel tired. The girl has an accordion she used to play I stroke the velvet keys, yellow and green they are. I show her how to pick out a tune. I like the accordion and want her to give it to me. Dovre is shocked I would take it from her as it is an important memory thing for her. I am a bit callous and figure she won't miss it for long. I look out the window and we are traveling down a narrow one lane road. The trees almost form a tunnel exactly big enough for the bus to get through. I see large black animals with huge snouts and tusks. I call out to "Dad" and say look at the pig dogs. He stretches in order to see out the back window and sees them. We are passing through an old town, maybe one I know. I look for landmarks I would recognize. Maybe the old house we used to live in. Now I'm at "home" and unpacking. A piece of round moss from Dovre, some old ballet slippers and I put these things on a shelf in a bowl to keep them as keepsakes. I am trying to show Dovre I really care. (332 words)

["Wanting Drew Carey."] I am in a house with Drew Carey. I want him sexually. I arrange some pillows from a cupboard on the floor to make a comfortable resting place. I take off my clothes and lie down, waiting for him to join me. He doesn't come to me. He chooses to lie down on a bed in another room. I get up and drape a white towel around me and walk into the bedroom. I catch him trying to run up the stairs to avoid me. He feels embarrassed. I ask him to explain what's going on for him. We lie down on a couch. Our heads at opposite ends as we talk. He says he feels uncomfortable jumping right into sex. He'd like it better if we talked a long time and got to know each other. I agree. I tell him I think he is intelligent and I enjoy the creativity he shows. He seems shy. I touch him on the leg as we talk. (166 words)

["Finding a spacious room in my house."] I live in a tiny house. I am telling a woman who works for me where and what plants to trim or work with. There is a huge colorful cricket on one plant. It is very cute. White, like it has a satin tuxedo on. The woman uses a paper towel to pick it up. We walk across a hall into a courtyard. She releases it out there. I walk into the courtyard and walk around it in amazement. I didn't know this house had this. It is spacious, enclosed, a room and lovely. A brick fireplace, a high window where I look back out at the courtyard and see a high window and lots of big pretty plants there. When I lie on the couch that is my view. As I walk around I find three or four different pianos and organs. They are all broken. One doesn't have any keys. Another, an organ will play but it's out of tune and vibrates oddly. I really like this room. I wonder why I've lived so long in the house in the ordinary cramped rooms and not out here. I decide to move in immediately. I imagine nice fires in the fireplace.

["Van is stolen."] Dovre and I are talking on a cell phone. I am standing outside near a freeway. I am trying to return home from S City. She asks where the van is and I look and see that Michael K. (new dreamer in group) is stealing it. He turns right onto the freeway, the opposite direction I need to go to get home. I try and run after him, calling out, stop. Hey. He stole my van. I turn left and run down a rutted dirt path. It is hard to keep up the pace. I am growing tired. (98 words)

["Beautiful garden and burnt backs of houses."] I am in a house. I slept the night with the daughter of the house, a younger friend of mine. I am trying to help her out. We are up and talking with her father, a very good looking well built man. The woman says she is a lesbian. I am a little upset, thinking I'd wished I'd known that before I slept with her. I feel nervous. Then I tell myself I'm being silly because there was no sexual part of our night. I am aware that I am prejudiced about lesbians and feel guilty about it. I let it go. Now there is a needlepointed sign or banner over the window. The name of a society that helps mentally ill people. The Philo-something society. I am interested in this because of the woman. Her father is going to get her signed up for this society. I notice the fee is $70,000 to join. I know I can't afford it for me, but hopefully I can attend as a helper of the woman. I decide it is time for me to leave this house. I am attracted to the concert going on in the house across the street. I walk into the room and sit, listening to the small built man singing. I like the songs very much. The man gives me intense eye contact as he realizes I love his music. He and I are attracted. He finishes singing and I get up and walk out of the house. He follows me asking, "Do you hear that lovely sound?" I say yes. I love the sound of rushing water in a brook. He says do you smell the flowers perfume? I say yes. It is exquisite. He says come look at my beautiful garden. I walk along the side of the house to the back. I see an elaborate pattern of huge roots intertwined. It is very beautiful. Like a wrought iron pattern. Circles and intertwined figure eights.. Then I get on a swing and swing back and forth across the back yard which is a smooth shallow pond. He joins me and we swing together. We get off on the other side of the pond and stand at a stone wall which marks the end of his property. I say to him, I see that the ordinary world lies beyond here. It is not pretty. We look back to the back of his house. He says it doesn't look good. I see that the walls have been burned but the pattern with the left over blue paint and the blackened spots are beautiful. I say no, it looks pretty. The house across the street is the one that looks bad. It is badly burned and charred. I then see the woman come out all dressed up in a formal dark dress and a bun hairdo. She's ready to go out on the town. I am concerned. I say to the man I have to return and help. He follows me as I swing across the pond and walk to the other house. I go in and find the extremely good looking father lying naked on a couch. He wants me to join him. I say no. You have a beautiful face. Your body is beautiful. You are intelligent and kind. But you can't share your feelings.. I bring his daughter to the couch. They sit facing each other. I say she's leaving because you can't share your emotions with her. I try to assist them to speak to each other. The singing man watches, waiting for this to be done so we can go away together. (609 words)

["Beautiful eclipse."] I am in the old Mac house. I step outside to see the sky. It is mid afternoon but it is as dark as night. I see clouds, dark and black, then the night sky with many stars. I step off the porch and turn to see the eclipse. I remember that to look at one with the naked eye could be damaging to my eyesight. I see a round darkened sun with three or four sparkly lights where the moon is beginning to move from the edge revealing the sun. It is beautiful to see. I comment on its beauty to my mother who is standing on the porch. I see leaves and their shadows on the house front wall and for a moment think that is the eclipse. (130 words)

["Weird cake."] I made a cake. I am frosting it. This is for some special presentation for a group of people. The loaf cake breaks in two or three pieces. I place it back together and spread the chocolate frosting on the top. Then I drizzle some extra chocolate on the top of the frosting. It makes a pretty pattern. Then I have more frosting left, so I begin to plop big blobs of it on the cake and ruin the pretty look of it. However, it does have lots of chocolate and tastes great. (93 words)

["Grandma Maude and Grandpa Lee are ill."] I am setting up a shop where items made by people with disabilities are being sold. I have many small colorful knick knacks on the wall for display. People are coming in and looking around as I am setting things up. A small girl is left unattended by her mother who is outside looking at things. I see she breaks a small doll. I take her hand and walk her out to her mom and lecture the mother about leaving her unattended. I ask the mother to pay for the broken item. She is annoyed with me. I walk back in and now see there are two or three rooms. I explore each one. Pretty furniture, lots of things on display. The colorful items remind me of bright yarn dolls made by Guatemalan Indians. Now I am in a room where Grandma Maude is resting on a couch. My mother sits near her. I see Grandpa Lee sitting in a chair on my right. I hear Grandpa Lee making a clicking sound with his very fat tongue. He is ill. I then see Grandma Maude has slipped off the couch and fallen on the floor. I realize I am the healthiest person in the room, which isn't saying much. I find it ironic. I struggle over there and roll her gently back on the couch. She is thin and sweating. I am concerned for her. She is also very ill. (240 words)

["Swimming the river of grades."] I am visiting Charla at school. Only the school is outdoors. Each grade is on a different side of the river. I must cross the river to talk with each grade teacher. The 5th grade is at a shallow part. I can manage that one OK. The next on I need to go to (6th grade is up stream and it is very deep. Perhaps waist to chest deep. I am afraid of it. I decide to go back two grades and see that teacher. I look in the river and see it is a dug out "lake" very deep like a swimming pool. I hesitate jumping in. I explain I am afraid of deep water. I then say Oh, to hell with it and jump in and swim a few feet to the edge and struggle to get out of the steep embankment. Now I go back to the 6th grade teacher. Charla and I sit down after cross the river. I say to the teacher I need to explain something about Charla. Charla cries out, annoyed, why do you have to tell everyone? Why do they have to know. I say its to help you out. They can work with you better if they understand. Charla pouts and then says Ok, but I'll tell her. She says its a cross between hypnosis and...I begin to choke from a throat seizure (and wake up.) (235 words)

["Finding the river."] I am in a wheelchair. I am trying to cross a street because I want to see the river. I am going to write a book and the river tells the story. I look to my left across the street and see a restaurant on a hill overlooking the river. The perfect place to write the river story. Two or three other people join me. Another person in a manual wheelchair. We go up the hill to the restaurant. The others go in first. I see a right turn into the restaurant from the hall. It is a tight fit because a blue piano is by the door. I tell the woman at the door I can fit. Just barely. We wheel in and go to a table right in front of the window. I stand up to see better. I see a small river with beautiful trees on the banks. I am very pleased with this river. It is exactly the right kind. It is smaller and shallower than the main river I first saw. I sit to begin writing. (181 words)

["Talking about Charla."] I am talking with a woman. She and I are friends. It is a pleasant talk. Then I am dressed in a short brown skirt and nylons. I am young and thin. I sit on the floor. I am talking with the woman and several men, like Chuck and a nice man are listening in. The nice man comes over and sits beside me. He is curled up comfortably very close to me. I like him and would love to cuddle with him, but I am aware that he is married. He asks me how old Charla is and I say 14 years old. Then he asks how is she doing. I explain that she has trouble because she has a chemical imbalance. He is sympathetic for her and for me. He then comes close and brushes something gently away from my eye. I at first think he is trying to kiss me. I lean into it, wanting it, then I pull back because it would be wrong. He looks at me, wondering what I'm doing. I smile apologetically. We continue talking in a friendly way about Charla. (188 words)

["Moving to another house."] I moved into a new house. I rented it furnished. I notice the TV is small and old. I ask Bonnie who is helping me move to bring my 32" TV from my bedroom and my other TV as well. She agrees to help. I walk outside to check out the neighborhood. I see a restaurant where I can eat pancakes and syrup. As I come out I see it is next door to the public library (which looks like the Old MM City library.) I am very happy about this. I walk a few more blocks to find the street I turn left on to get to my new house. I try to see the street sign in order to remember what the street name is called. I am remembering how to get back to my house when I leave it. (142 words)

["Ocean bites our butts on the couch."] I am visiting someone's house. We are outside. Bonnie has asked the owner of the house if she could keep her plants there for awhile. She is there to visit them and see how they are doing. I look out and see the ocean quite a ways away. Bonnie and I greet each other. Then I see a wave coming toward us. We are surprised and begin to run toward the house. We are going up a very steep sand dune and Bonnie is on her belly flailing away. I am crawling. It is hard going. We struggle and barely make it to the open carport. We sit on a couch and the wave comes right up to us. Even spraying us a bit. We are very surprised. Now Bonnie is stirring a huge metal bowl full of figs and nuts. She calls this an orchard mix she made. Sort of like a cookie dough. She looks at her hanging plants. Someone isn't taking good care of them. (168 words)

["Selling dreams."] I am in a room where a presentation of various dream product sales people are preparing to sell their wares. They are all seated in two rows in an alcove and then in a raised bleacher thing up on the wall. Two women were standing on a raised platform near the ceiling. They were signaling to the audience with their wares. Finally, I get up on the alcove stage area to start the show. A big wall keeps appearing to my left in front of me which obscures the audiences view. I think it out of the way but it returns several times. I tell the small audience that I will begin the show. I will give each salesperson a chance to sell their wares (this surprises the women) They thought they'd have to sneak attention. Then I point out a wall of small dream products and say contrary to what it looks like, we aren't just here to sell dream products. We have a good show for you. Later, I am seated in the audience, waiting. A bathroom is down a step in a hall. I will it to be accessible on the same floor level. It changes. (199 words)

["Murdering my family."] There are two of "me." We are like twins. Pretty, young, blonde. I am the hard working counselor. She is a psychopath. She wears sexy clothes, I wear conservative clothes. She puts her baby, child and husband in a deep snow bank and shoves them under even deeper. They are freezing. There are odd squares of "snow" with imprints of some design on them. I or she keeps moving them aside. Then she pulls them out of the snow and puts them in a coffin like crate. She feels some guilt. She could take care of them now and they would be safe. But she shrugs her shoulders and leaves them in the crate, dragging it into a house and hiding it in a couch. Some little girl, a neighbor is there and helps her. She doesn't tell the little girl they are burying people alive. She leaves them there to die, still feeling some twinges of guilt. Now she comes in search of me. She takes over my body. My clothes transform into a tight angora sweater, nylons and a short black skirt. I am now her or visa versa. She walks the halls of my school where I work and causes problems for people, not caring anything about them. She laughs. Now she (me) and Charla are walking, looking for a bathroom. We find one. But a woman is in the stall and it is messy and stinky. She/I walk back out saying it is too stinky and we will find another one. My mother comes to us and says why were you doing (something). She is suspicious of me now. I sign, annoyed, because I am going to have to kill her again. I take a picture of a tiger on a black background. I decide to keep it and take it to my room which has opaque windows and a door with a clear glass window in it. The paste or glue is on the picture side, so I place it on the inside of the door window. My mother asks me what I am doing. I ignore her. Now Charla and I are walking down a street. I look up and see a square cloud with very well defined edges. It is moving very fast and it is dark. It is headed out to sea. I watch with interest. Now it is an odd square shaped boat/plane flying back in. I go aboard it and I see a man. He is very attracted to me. As he approaches, smiling and preparing to give me a line, I pull out a golden pistol and shove it in his face. I am going to kill him. (449 words)

Ginny says a woman gave it to him, because he is ill and goes to Boise to see a special doctor (Dr. Arquette). I see then that Ernie looks plump and not well. I am glad to see him.

It is hard work but I continue cheerfully to do the dishes, one at a time. I keep asking people to help. I make jokes and try to make it fun. After awhile, someone starts helping. We playfully make a game out of it. More people come and help. Now everyone is helping and things are getting cleaned up. Sorority women come in and are disdainful. We ignore them and look like we are having fun. (Because we are!) Soon, they help too. Then a punk teen boy says he's not going to help. His clothes are dirty, so I grab him and wash him like I'm hand-washing clothes. I am vigorous and the poor guy yelps as I thrash him around in the sink. I see lots of filthy water come out of the clothes. That will do. I say, and release him.. Now he's willing to help. (238 words)

["Dangerous waters."] Doug and Lydia, Dwight, me and Charla are at the beach. We decide we want to go out on the ocean on a boat. I am apprehensive. The waves seem rough and big. We start out through the surf. I keep asking Doug if we have extra gas on board, because we would not want to run out of gas. He says no. Then I ask if there at least some oars on board. In case we run out of gas. I pick one up and begin to paddle. Now we are out in the deep water. The boat is being pitched around by the large waves. They become larger and rougher. I am worried now. I want us to turn around before we'd gone too many miles and run out of gas. We begin to turn the boat around. Charla falls overboard. I am frantic. I can see her sinking under the water. I turn the boat back around and paddle like hell to get to her. I call to her. She seems unconscious. I reach down and grab her hair and pull her up. I get her on board. She isn't breathing. I begin CPR on her, begging her to start breathing. She chokes and becomes conscious, breathing. Thank God. I am relieved. Then I look up and see a huge tidal wave coming at us. I scream. We frantically force the boat to go as fast as it can toward shore. The wave will engulf us. I anticipate how horrible it will be to hold my breath. Maybe we will survive, maybe not. We finally manage to get back on shore, alive. (275 words)

["Drew Carey live."] I am in a room, working on my video project. I sit at my desk. Someone comes in to have me guess who has come to visit me. A curtain is pulled across the left portion of the space by my desk. A man stands behind the curtain. I can see his outline and the yellow suit coat he is wearing. I am not fooled. It is Drew Carey. Someone tells me they are very pleased with my video project and will buy it but I must edit it down more tightly. In particular, the ending segment. I am happy they like it and assure them I will be happy to edit it. I know it needs it. Now I am looking at a survey Lucy has filled out. I read her answers and decide I will answer the same way. I notice she checked on the SEX question that 50% of the time she has sex alone, 40% of the time, sometimes with people and 10% of the time she has sex with someone. I think I should make it more accurate for my situation. But I don't. Now we travel to someplace. We are in a house. Drew Carey has come with us. We are attracted to each other. (211 words)

["Inadequate, false."] I am sitting on a couch. I am waiting for a woman director who will work with me on a play. I have the lead part. A man named Kent comes over and sits near me on my right. I am distracted and not real friendly. Suddenly he leans over and kisses me on the mouth. It is a french kiss and I don't find it very interesting. Boring. He is trying to talk me into having sexual relations with him. I am confused and stammering. I am trying to tell him I don't want to with him. I am trying to say his style of asking for it without relationship or love doesn't work with me. Then the woman director comes in. I get up and abandon Kent. The director says she hates false over acted love scenes in movies. I agree. Then she grabs me and pushes me down on the couch planting big over acted false kisses on my cheek near my mouth. I am very uncomfortable, her breasts and mine are pushed together. I want to push her away. I try to go along with the pretend acting and say I know what you mean. Then they writhe around. We pretend to writhe around. Finally she lets go of me to my relief. Then Dovre comes in the room. She just woke up and wants my attention. I tell her, her hair is messy and then, distracted, I abandon her too so I can pay attention to the director's directions. A man director comes in now. He tells me to act some lines. I start. He stops me saying I am not giving it enough passion and action. He mimes for me the gesture of a fish hook catching in my mouth and me writhing like a hooked fish as I deliver the lines. I think that is ridiculous and over acting. Then the woman director says she wants more from me. I try to explain to her that first I need to memorize the lines and then I play with them adding the intensity and emotions. I feel very inadequate. I must have failed. I feel incapable. She does not approve of my methods. She tells me she is disappointed. She had heard so much good stuff about my skills. My reputation had preceded me. Now she is unhappy with my ability. I feel terrible, inadequate and a failure. (404 words)

["Bathing Grandma Maude"] I am working on a project with my computer. I have lots of work to do. I am worried about how the files will transfer from the old style to the new. I am in an office, like at a college. I am distracted by other people needing my attention. Apparently Grandma Maude is very old and fragile and needs a bath. I am distracted but interrupt my work to give her a shower. It is hot. We walk into another room, like a separate cabin. I turn on the shower head on the wall. There is no shower stall or curtain. I pull up a stool for her to sit on. She walks in, naked and not as old or fragile as I thought. I tell her to sit on the stool but she sits on the floor, her legs folded in a lotus position. I am amazed she is so flexible. Her hair is long and flowing, dark with streaks of grey. I shower her and spray myself, even though I am clothed, as it is so hot. Now the shower is done. My mother is on her knees on a couch, singing "I wonder if I have been abused." Over and over. I am a little annoyed at her and also glad because if she is willing to ask questions and check things out, then maybe I'll finally find out if I've been abused. (237 words)

["Living on an island."] I live in a small hut on a tiny island in a river. The river is flooded and raging. The only way I can get to town is to go hand over hand up a rope tied to the high embankment. I shinny up the rope and crawl through a plastic tarp hiding my entrance. I am in a backyard of a friend of mine. He steps out the back door and says Hi. I ask if his wife is in. He says yes and I go in to visit her. She has built a pottery studio in the house and is busy working on a new piece. I watch her as she is burying a pot in the ashes of a fireplace kiln. Another hot kiln is roaring in an alcove next to the room. I tell her I like her studio and the fact that she built her special space just for her artistic needs. She is going to give me a pot as a gift. She steps around the corner into the living room. I peek in and see ordinary couch and chairs and so on. She hands me a lovely pot. I thank her and go back to the entrance and shinny down the rope to my island. I am approaching the hut and become concerned that someone dangerous is in there waiting for me. I enter cautiously. Sure enough, there is a man there. I pull out a yellow shotgun and point it at him saying back into that corner. If you try and escape I will shoot. I dial 911 on my cell phone for the police. He smiles and pretends to sit up straight or stand up. He is deliberately baiting me. I am poised to shoot. I don't want to kill him, but if I must I will. I warn him again that he had better sit still. At the last moment. I point the gun at his foot thinking I'd just wound him, not kill him. I fire one shot, then reload one handed, quite skillfully. We wait for the police. (350 words)

["Rocking out to sea."] I am being shown a special boat the loggers use on the river as they log. It's a rocker boat, a sort of raft with very high sides made of planks, like an old fashioned hay wagon. It is built to rock back and forth, sideways with the weight of all the logs they gather. I am on the boat and we are going out to sea. At first, we have a hard time getting across the beach to the ocean. I think it is odd we are on land and trying to move in a boat. I look up and see a huge cruise ship on the horizon of the land. Perhaps it is docked past the rise of the dunes. The scene is very dark, I can barely make out the shapes of the sand dunes and rocks. We finally struggle out to sea and cross the surf breakers. It is still very dark. I am seated to the right of and slightly behind a good looking man. I am trying to light a cigarette. Only all I have is a roll of money. I peal off a bill and light it. I puff away and then realize it is a 100 dollar bill. I blow it out and look for a one dollar bill to smoke. The man watches. He lays his arm around me, as he is attracted to me. I am attracted to him as well. I find a paper fake bill like a coupon and roll it up and light it. Suddenly a man behind us screams sharks. He is looking out behind us. I feel fear. A large shark roars up onto the raft with his mouth lunging at us. Then they are all around his. We turn and head back to shore. We are in danger and are running for our lives, only we are a slow moving boat. We dock and swerve to avoid being eaten. Finally we get back on shore, one shark still trying to follow us up onto the sand. I am afraid. (345 words)

["Hasani dances naked."] I am sitting in the audience to see a performance. I am with Bonnie and another woman friend. Hasani comes to the performance area and takes off her clothes, except for a black shawl across her shoulders, which doesn't cover anything. She is slim, young, with small breasts. She is dancing the story she is telling. The audience is scandalized. Bonnie's mouth drops open. She is shocked. I hold a small package with a letter handwritten by Hasani. I am trying to read it. Then during her performance I move near the area she is at and start talking with her. I feel embarrassed I'd interrupt her performance. She doesn't seem to mind. We talk about what's happening in our lives. Now Bonnie and her friend and I are leaving in the middle of her performance. I turn to Bonnie and say I forgot my things on the seat. She goes back to get it, embarrassed to be so conspicuous. She grabs up the thin pillow Aunt Millie made for me. I point to some more things at another seat. She rushes through and grabs them too. I mouth, Thank you to her. She is annoyed with me. (198 words)

There is sorting of the pills, and confusion on which ones to take and how many. I have difficulty swallowing them. My throat seems dry. (112 words)

["Cracking the code for a free ride."] I am in a house. Charla is not being cooperative getting ready for school. I am very frustrated with her. I see the school bus drive past. I grab Charla and her backpack and drag her along the road to the bus stop. I keep saying You'll miss your bus. Now get up and help me. Charla dawdles along. Sure enough as we approach the parked bus, other parents are driving their kids there. and I mutter to myself. Be there. Still be there. We're coming. I hated the idea of spending the day with Charla in her mood if she misses the bus. But as we get close, the bus does drive away without her. Now I am really angry. We begin walking back toward the house. I whimsically decide to continue on down the road, since we're out. I notice we are in the sort of desert area, like in Nevada. A rough expedition is forming to take people out into the desert and see the sights. I decide I want to go. It would be fun. I go up to the male guide who is standing by a jeep like black vehicle. I say, Here's the deal. I want to come on this trip but I don't have the right clothes or equipment. I don't even have shoes on and am in my pajamas. The man laughs at me. Then he becomes thoughtful and gives me a set of papers and says read this. I look at it and see it is an elaborate code. I casually read out a few words as I begin to understand the code. I see target and nuclear and buildings. As I say these words, the man realizes I can break the code. So he says OK, we'll get you the right equipment and you can come with us, but your job will be to read this code. I agree, realizing this is important military stuff. We are now in the vehicle and I am driving up a very steep sandy muddy road. I am having fun squirreling around in the mud. The man is observant and impressed with my skills. We crest the hill and I look down the steep road and see in the distance the lights of a big city, like Las Vegas. It is very beautiful. We go down the hill. I am using the brakes. Charla wants us to go fast and I say that's too dangerous. I read somewhere it is a delusion to think it'd be fun then you get too fast and can't stop. I ride the brakes skillfully. (436 words)

["Scam artists at work."] I am the owner of a gas station/cafe in some small town. I am also working on some project, making something. I have a huge back room that might have once been a factory. High ceilings, row lights, large windows on the left and many rows of long tables. I come in and notice that it seems dark. I turn on the lights but it is not enough for the detail work I will be doing. I am frustrated. Lydia is there and I say to her I need to figure out how much money I am making in this business and what is selling. I think maybe nothing much is selling. I don't even think I have any employees in the front working the cafe. I look out the front window and see a woman sponging off some merchandise on racks. Oh, maybe I have one. I should be supervising her. I lie down on a table while Lydia and I are talking. I stretch my legs out across the couch next to the table. I realize my mother is sitting there and I apologize if I made her uncomfortable. She smiles and says no, not a problem go ahead and rest them on me. Then I say to Lydia maybe I should change this business and sell what I love doing and what people want. I suggest chocolate desserts. Lydia reminds me we already tried that. She baked them and worked as waitress, but nobody bought them. Then I suggest a book store. I ask Dwight if this town already has a book store. Then I see through the window that two twin girls are spraying water with a hose and ruining things. I quickly go out there and as I walk toward the girl, she sprays me. I determinedly walk to her and take the hose from her. She is uppity and I tell her she's in trouble now. She laughs at me and says maybe the hose was stolen and maybe it was mine. She runs outside to the car where her mother and father are. I chase after her. I see the mother and demand her name and say I will sue her for the damages. I lecture her on how mothers are responsible for supervising their children and she wasn't doing that. She is smirky and sassy. I demand her name. She laughs and gets into the car. The Father comes out and I ask him her name. He says her name is Balboa, spelled boacea. Her middle name is baby eyes, spelled baby ies. I search for a paper in my pocket and find one already written on so I try to find clear space to write on. It is difficult to do. I ask for the phone number and he says the newspaper, boxes between 0 and 12 and you must call at precisely 8:00 or it won't work. By this time I realize they are scam artists and aren't giving me valid information. I try to read their license plate number on the car and remember what they look like to report them to the police.

["Abusing Charla, Howard is mean and I win the boat race."] I am in a house and Charla is being uncooperative. Refusing to help me. I am very out of control angry at her. I slap her repeatedly in her face and shove her around while yelling at her to help me. She just gets worse. I feel helpless rage at her. I also feel tremendous guilt for being so abusive to her. I want to apologize and get her forgiveness. Then Howard is there and I realize we are moving immediately. He is leaving now and I will follow after I sell the house, get things packed up and drive the moving van there myself. He climbs to the top of a ladder. I follow him berating him for leaving me with these impossible tasks. I tell him I can't drive a big truck. It doesn't have power steering or automatic transmission. I say I don't know how to sell a house. He just smiles and keeps walking away from me. Then I realize he means we will move to New York City. I am appalled. That's too big and scary for me. How will I manage it alone? He then jokingly takes off a 1950's petticoat and scrambles down off the ladder, leaving me at the top precariously trying to get down by myself. I get down and am on a wharf or boardwalk. I see a woman in a speedboat racing. In the water. I watch as she tries to make fast turns into wooden gates. Because she is moving so fast, every small movement she makes on the wheel makes the ride jerky. She is an amateur. I get in a boat and race her. Now the boats are like cards and I slide over other cards in the water. I dangerously take the risky way by skirting the edge of the deep water where only half my boat is actually on water. The other side hangs over an edge. I duck and speed around the other cards, sometimes right over them. We are neck and neck. I win by a nose. She pulls out a score card. Her mileage is 1 10th of a mile more than mine which indicates I lost. But I know I won and remember that I started the race a bit after her from a different place which is why the mileage looks like I lost. (395 words)

I have a projection screen with the instructions up there and I am giving them instructions on how best to do their job. I tell them that it is fine they are wearing jeans and informal wear at work but each one must buy one dress which they will be required to wear four times a year at work functions. I tell them that any dress will be fine as long as it isn't low cut or the hem too high or too tight and revealing. I tell them the grey haired men who work in those offices will be too distracted with such dresses and you will lose your job. (432 words)

["Howard leaves me, angry."] I am married to Howard, we are in a large 1950's modern house. Lots of windows. Lots of small children around. Including Dovre and the other girls. Howard wants to start up sexual relations again. He gets in my face and insists. He tries to pull down his pants. I am annoyed. I am absolutely not interested. I go away from him. He is very angry and yells at me that he is leaving the relationship. I basically say good! He gets more angry. He packs up and leaves the house. I am relieved. But I regret that he wont be there to help out with the children. Now I have to do it all. I decide that's OK. I can handle that. It's a good trade off. I am fixing breakfast for them. It's messy. I spill things. (139 words)

["Sorting used clothes for charity."] Patricia is running a charity where we have racks of used clothing to sell. I am helping her to do inventory. She is teaching me how to do it right. She shows me a pair of old corduroy white jeans with a frayed hole in the butt. She tells me to write exactly what I see on any tags or labels. I see a company name and an address and some numbers. I ask if I should write it all down. She says yes. Then I comment that some of these old clothes are mine. This pair of jeans, for instance. She says I like these jeans. I say so do I. Then I suggest she cut them up and use the material in something else. She likes that idea a lot. She is getting creative ideas about what to do with the material, maybe make a quilt. I go to the end of the racks lined up along the wall. There are hundreds of clothes jammed on these racks. This will be a long job. I begin to do the work. (182 words)

["Abner and Sonja."] I see Abner and his wife in bed. I am interested that he has a book and probably a writing book he uses for his manuscript. I am curious what's in it. Now I see the woman is Sonja and she'd just had a baby. It's like a snapshot of them. I like seeing it. (55 words)

["Silly bathroom rules."] I am at a conference. At an expensive hotel. We have a full agenda of workshops all day. Then we must take a short break and then do an evening workshop too. At the break, I am in my room. Apparently I have roommates, one of which is male. He is seated on the bed as he puts on his shoes. I am lying on the bed as I started to fall asleep because I was so tired. But I force myself to wake up to get ready for the next workshop. He says I don't have to go. Someone can take my name and some identifying information like my driver's license number. He looks at me. I say well, that would be cheating and decide not to help him. I Disapprove of his attitude. Now I am going down the hall to a bathroom. I need to pee. But the security guard stops me. He says just a minute. How many times have you used the bathroom today? I am surprised and say why? He says we have rules. You are only allowed to go at certain amount of times. I look into the large lobby area and see many people lined up waiting for their turn. I am frustrated and annoyed. He tells me to wait in line. I pace back and forth very angry. I say Fuck. Fuck. Over and over. An attendee, male, says why are you wasting your energy being angry? I pause and consider this. I say reasonably, You have a good point. I stop swearing, but I continue to be frustrated. Now I see Maggie, in her wheelchair. They call her name. I say Hi to her as she tries to walk up the stairs to the bathroom dragging her manual wheelchair with her. I am talking with some man on my right about how ridiculous these rules are. I tell him with some pride that I know her. Now I am looking at a brochure of the place and see a snapshot of me, in my polyester blue and white jacket, with my hair permed. Like when I was at the community college. I am surprised. I say oh yes, I remember. I was doing physical therapy at the community college and they asked to take my picture to use in state brochures about this. It is a moving picture like a video. I am seated and I am walking around in the background. Now I tell someone I drink 7 glasses of water a day and need to pee frequently. They show me the schedule. Between 3 and 4 you can pee at 3:08 and at 3:40 and so on. This won't help me, I say. Then I look at my watch and see that it is 8:20pm. I am late for the workshop. I try to decide if I should just hold it and go to the workshop or stay and wait. I try and figure out if I can go to my hotel room and pee there. (508 words)

["Noisy politicians on the radio."] I am waiting to give a speech in a building. The seats in the lecture/classroom are raked. I am listening to the other speakers. They are politicians and drone on and on. It is loud. I go out into the hall. I am gathering up my props and materials. I come back in. It is my turn but the other speakers just keep talking. I try and interrupt and have to talk loudly to speak over them. I am annoyed at them. It has been all day. I am talking about disability issues. Can't get them to shut up as I struggle to get the attention of the audience. Later, I walk down the hall. I am looking at the writings and objects on the wall. I realize I am dreaming and say to myself. I'm in a dream. This feels exciting. I also realize I am in a state close to waking. (153 words)

["Mom and Patricia."] I am visiting my mother. It is a large room in a mall. She is confused about what had happened to her. (hospitalization.) She is still weak. Others try to help her understand, but to no avail. I am looking through a file of papers and find a letter from Patricia responding to a question I had asked her. I am pleased she responded. She had found a grey pair of socks I asked about and sent me a pair, all balled up plus one more a darker shade of grey in case I wanted the darker shade. I look up to see that my mother is dressed in a pink suit and high heels (heals?) and leaving the room. She is in desperate search for something. I hurriedly put on high heels and join her to protect her. I take her arm and we walk side by side. She has trouble balancing in those shoes. I ask her questions trying to figure out what she's looking for. She mumbles and it doesn't make sense. Suddenly, we come to a steep staircase. We are at the top. It frightens my mother as her balance isn't good. She teeters on the edge, then turns and walks back to her room. (209 words)

["George did it."] Someone, a friend (female) died. I am convinced she was killed. I have no evidence. My "ex-husband", a gentleman like Ike Turner is questioning me. He's a cop, undercover, I guess. He is suspicious that I know something. I wonder if he did it. He has a sleek car. I turn to walk away. A young man, very respectful and attracted to me invites me to ride in his car. It's a bright red sexy car. I agree, liking the idea of showing up. "Ike." He will be jealous. When we are in the car, I suddenly realize "George" is the murderer. But I can't prove it. I cagily ask him questions. He now is concerned and watching me carefully. Now we are in a large room. And I am still asking George questions as I look nonchalantly through a box of paper, hoping against hope I find some evidence. Then I find 2 things. A CD George gave my friend and a notebook my friend wrote in. I guess there are coded messages on these and I pull them out. George is getting very nervous now and his eyes narrow as he watches me closely. I tease and bait him like a lawyer until he confesses, because he's convinced I have the evidence. (214 words)

["Mexicans and stealing."] I put some of my things in a car and leave it for some Mexicans to steal. Then I and my companion decide to steal some of their stuff. We sneak into an area to take things. Then I feel overcome with guilt and fear they will arrive early and catch us. I demand we go hide until they are out of here. We go up a level and hide under a pile of clothes. Another family comes in and takes their own things and finally depart. My companion wants to get up and go on. I shush her, afraid we will be found. We finally decide the Mexicans must be done and gone. I get up and my companion wants us to go visit her friends upstairs in the office of the manager. I peek over the edge of the balcony and fearfully look to see if the Mexicans are around. We don't see them. Now the beach area is full of tables and we furtively walk past where they were supposed to have been. I see one of them drinking from a glass seated at the table. I am so afraid of being caught. I hurry past and go up a flight of stairs to the office manager apt. I go to the top of the carpeted stairs but a recording starts. A woman's voice says they are not at home because her husband had died suddenly and she hadn't anyone to help her manage the office so she took the day off. I hurriedly rush down the stairs to get out as we aren't supposed to be there. I am afraid I will be caught. The stairs become raked theater seats and a gap is there. I must jump from one row to another, over the gap. I hesitate. It looks too far to jump. I then step carefully down one row where a lone seat is and then jump. I am successful. I leave quickly still afraid and furtive. (333 words)

I am in a house, waiting in the living room for the social worker to come. We are going to decide what I need. A few women come in and sit down. I scoot to make room for them on the couch. They sit waiting. I look around wondering why we hadn't started yet. And saw 10 or so people sitting around. I am surprised. We are waiting for more to arrive. I notice there are chairs placed all along the walk. I begin to count how many people are in the room. Around 70 people. I am amazed. Why do they need so many I ask the leader woman. She says because we don't know yet what you'll need so we have to have every dept. represented. I scoot over to the left more and am now sitting very close to a good looking man, the supervisor. He smiles and flirts and we chat. He has his shirt off and his hairy chest and back are soft and warm to the touch. I look and see 2 babies out in a carriage. I notice they aren't wearing anything but diapers. I am annoyed that with so many helper people in the room, no one is helping the babies. They must be cold. I walk down the bleachers over to them and try to tuck them in with a small quilt. Now there is some form of entertainment going on in the crowd. I wonder when this meeting will ever start. I try and list what I might need so I'll be ready when it does start. (267 words)

Now I'm sitting at a table in a booth waiting for the 2nd meeting. I see Ellie and Charla come in. A few social workers come in. A man stands by me telling me we need to move over to the booths to make more room for more social workers. I sigh. Here we go again. The man has glasses on. He is also very warm and friendly. He shows me some pictures of him as he was growing up. I see his orchestra picture. He has drawn a box around himself in all the photos so I'll know which one is him. I wish he'd let me guess first. I smile at his boyish face. I see he played his violin. He is standing behind me and leaning in very close. I lean back into his arms and say Did you ever play 1st violin? He laughed and says yeah. Sometimes. I smile. Me too. I say. We laugh at the fun of us having these same experiences. I enjoy him and he enjoys me. (176 words)

["Track star in the rough."] I am a young woman, maybe 20. I love to run. I am running across a track field as a track practice or meet is happening. Just for the joy of it, I am running along the edge of the track and passing the runners. On the track including a car, with ease. The male coach sees this and wants me on the team. I laugh. I can't do it I have a night job at a factory. And my "mother" wouldn't like it. She would be upset. I walk away from him. He and his young assistant drive up to me as I'm walking in a pickup I tell him it won't do any good to try and talk me into it. I do get into the passenger side. He earnestly talks. I suddenly look over to the young man and ask who the fuck he is. The coach grins and tells me his name. I shrug, dismissing him as unimportant and pimply faced. I keep refusing the coach's earnest explanations, thinking how my mother needs me. (She's an alcoholic) and she'd be upset with me. Finally, I get out of the pick up and he stands in front of me and says I'll offer you a scholarship, I'll help you take care of your mother, You can go to college and do what you love to do. Better your life. I am scared to go against my "mother" but this is too good a deal to pass up. I feel attracted to him. He seems kind. I ask him, Are you an honest man? I will say yes. But there is much work I will have to do to assertively say yes and trust. (286 words)

["Moral teachings."] I am visiting in some woman's house. The children are rambunctious and naughty. I am going from room to room trying to coral them telling them to settle down. Don't be so noisy and disruptive. They will not listen. I get into one room where a man is sleeping. He might be the physical therapist. I then see the owner of the house (like Anastasia's friend) who is seated in the garden next to a non blooming bed of roses. She tells me that when the roses bloom, they are poisonous and no one can rent this house until they stop. I am sympathetic on how hard that would be for the owner. I scurry around herding the children into the main room. They keep escaping. Some of their teen friends are on the patio and I ask them to leave. They refuse, laughing at me. I tell one boy I know his father. They reluctantly leave. Now it is time for the priest to instruct me on moral lessons and quiz me. I stand in the room as he lectures. He draws a multi-colored design or graphic on my right shoulder and when he asks me a question, I am to point to the right section. He asks me a series of what would you of if---questions. I have trouble answering. The correct names. But I can explain the basic answer. At one point, my Hawaiian dress is so loose, my breast flops out. I feel embarrassed and try to tuck them back in. Finally I answer all the questions and the lesson is over. (266 words)

["Flying with the pain."] I am lying down and the pain in my foot is tremendous. Ginny is helping to get me on an airplane to fly me to S City. I am watching and I see the tailgate like piece slam down on both my feet, cutting off my right foot. I am in terrible pain. People are aghast at what happened. Now by will of my mind, I am lifting myself up and flying myself around still lying down on my back. I am looking around me and I see buildings that I am skimming over, barely making it over the tops. I see carnival rides I am skimming over and I feel like I'm experiencing a carnival ride. Now I see a country road and I turn left and follow it like I'm driving. Now I'm in a "car" maybe a convertible and must turn left or right. I ask the country singer with me which way to turn. He grins and says you choose. I turn left. Now I'm gliding (still on my back like I'm reclining in a hospital bed, slightly raised.) in a beautiful old hotel and each wing has different blues artists. I love being there and turn down a hall to listen to wonderful jazzy blues music.. A Negro man sings the blues. I am amazed at how perfect the music is and that I am making this music up in my head. It sounds just like I was listening to the radio. I see a ladies room and admire the signs on the wall. It is beautifully ornate, the decor. I concentrate on the wonderful music to keep my mind off the terrible pain. (279 words)

["Lovely new house in the country."] I bought an old large house in the country. Charla and I are moving in. My foot still hurts. Charla and I share a bed in a downstairs back bedroom. I am surprised at myself for having bought the house and for choosing the old beat up back bedroom and for moving so soon after the surgery. Charla and I are talking. She is restless. I peek into another room and see two toilets and a boy sitting at a desk. Apparently the other family hasn't completely moved out yet. Charla makes a sexy rude comment about the boy and uses the word "fuck." I scold her saying that is not appropriate. I restlessly turn on my left side and see a door with glass panes and the backyard. I wonder why I'd decided to sleep in the badly built old back bedroom. I decide to go upstairs and look around. It is a very lovely up there. Large spacious rooms and the view is exquisite. Rolling hills, majestic mountain, an ocean. I can see for miles like on top of a hillside. I am aware that I should be able to have such a view from a country village outside of E City. A children's camp is next door, The kids wear red T-shirts, I think Charla will like that. I wonder why I made the decision so quickly to move, a rash decision without considering things like what Charla's school would be like and where it is. We decide to go see if we can find the school. We walk down a country lane around a corner and an old building there looked like a school, but wasn't. We return to the house. I again marvel at the view. I remember an old woman died recently and willed it to me. I go back in and look over the rooms and decide the room on the left that used to be a formal dining room would be my library. I choose to sleep in the master bedroom on this floor. (342 words)

I rush to push her across the intersection. She is upset with me because she wanted to go the other way. I smile at her good naturedly and say don't worry, I'll take you back. I push her wobbly chair back across the intersection. Then I continue on my way. I now have a flame thrower and am burning any trash laying around on the sidewalk. I see a young man who looks like Chris Farley. He watches me. He is interested in following me around. I go back the way I came to the office. I work at. I go in and file some papers. He watches intently. (142 words)

["Sci fi scary movie."] I am exhausted and decide to sleep in the small two roomed house, next to my regular house. I lie down on my back on the ugly bed and am so tired. Then I am restless and get up. The place looks like a run down motel room. Blue print cotton curtains all wrinkled and open. I try and get them closed. Everything is a mess. I look out the window and see the little girl laying out a blanket and putting their teddy bears and dolls on the blanket. I lock the front door with chains and locks. I walk through the messy kitchen and lock one of the back doors, leaving the other two open so Bootsie can get in. I had cuddled her for a moment in the bed and she got restless and ran outside. I saw another cat scurry under the back door, so I decided that's how Bootsie came in and left the other two open so she would get back in. I worry about that leaving me vulnerable to burglars or bad guys. I am angry at Ellie for making such a mess. and here I am in the inferior house and she is in my good regular house. Dovre is there. As I am complaining about Ellie making such a mess, I look out the window, It is now dark out and the little girls have gone back inside. I think it odd they decided to set up their "picnic" so close to dark. I go outside to look. That's when I notice the front of the "house" is the driver's side of my van. The door is off the hinges and sitting in the van and a big bashed up area. She'd had an accident and didn't tell me. I am angry. I call out "Joe!" I go back into the house. A young 1950's hood (JD) stands there, Richard, also a young JD who was staying with our family. I accuse Joe "my brother" of messing up the house and wreaking the van. I yell at him, accusing him. I see gopher trails and holes all over the kitchen floor. Mud droppings all over. Joe and Richard run. I accuse Richard who runs up a hill. He's running away because I am accusing him. I realize this is bad, so I call out, "We can work this out. We love you anyway. He hesitates and then returns. Now we go into the regular house where I see my "Dad" an older Italian kind of guy in a T-shirt and pot belly. He invents things and has 2 "products" he is excited about marketing. They are minor silly things but he takes it all very seriously. A neighbor woman, young, pretty and sexy comes in and leans on him, her expansive cleavage showing. My "Dad" and Richard are flirting and staring at her breasts. She has dark hair. My "mother" is in the house, an unhappy woman. I angrily tell the young woman she must leave and never flirt with my "Dad" again. She laughs at me and I threaten her. I force her out the back door. She is backing out teasing me about how I can't stop her. She falls backward into a creek and I laugh and taunt her. I yell watch out for the snakes. There is a lot of green algae there and she screams and is frightened, struggling to get out of the murky water. I laugh at her. I go back in. Joe and Richard are working with my "father." "Dad" is sympathetic of my anger at Joe for ruining my van just after I spent $1500 on a new engine. He will have to work hard difficult jobs for long hours to pay me for the damages to the van. He also has to clean up my house. Then I see a giant tarantula leg walking over me. It is trying to wrap me in a web and I struggle. I realize these giant things are my "Dad's" creation, made to destroy my "mother." I struggle away and run outside knowing they've already killed my "mother." Now slimy snake like things are coming up out of the ground and grabbing for me. I run into my house very afraid. Joe and Richard are working for my "Dad" and now they are searching for me. I hide under a long box (wooden, rectangle). The size of a coffin, turned over me. They are plotting to kill me. Now I the dream "ego" see two of "me" running insanely out to the road and standing in front of an oncoming car which caused us to glow as the lights hit us. It was the police. They ran over us. We died. We were insane and trying to die because of the madness of my "brother" and "Dad" and all those giant snakes and spiders were too scary. (822 words)

["Accept!!"] I am in a hospital. I get up and walk wondering how it is possible to be able to step down on my left foot. I hear a turd fall to the floor from my butt. I am in an open, long room. A nurse and Mabel are there. I decide to use the potty chair but see the screen isn't in place around it. I walk over there and see a red icky mess under the potty pan I am relieved it was someone else's turd that fell. Mabel suggests we go for a walk. I ask again, in surprise, is it really OK for me to use my left foot. She says no problem. We walk out a side door to a weedy messy courtyard area in the back of the building. I see various cute animals that look like possums wandering around. A big yellow bird in a box moves right behind my knees and tries to bump into me as I walk. I am looking behind me at it, laughing at how cute it is. Mabel calls my attention to an owl like bird by the wall with huge glowing yellow eyes. Then Mabel snaps to attention hearing something. I look out the courtyard and to the street. I see some teen girls walking along. One girl is angry at the other. She says, "You shouldn't pick the roses!" She repeats that over and over. I realize it is Mabel's daughter and Mabel runs over to her to talk. I am left alone. A rowdy group of JD's gather around me. They threaten to beat me up. I try to talk them out of it. They force me to walk back toward the back of the courtyard. I yell out "Help. Help." Mabel help me." The teen boys laugh at me. I ask them why they are going to do this! They shrug and say just because I was there. They walk ahead of me. I run away from them back toward the street. I choose to hide myself under a thatch of scratchy bushes. I am uncertain this is a good decision. I rustle around, trying to hide myself. I wonder if I should try to run again. The teens find me easily. They laugh at me. I realize they are going to beat me up. and there's nothing I can do to avoid it so I stoically stand there, chatting with them, waiting for it to be over with. This somehow impresses them and the dream ends without the beating. (426 words)

["Jim Carrey and me."] I am walking down a sidewalk. I am some book store clerk (and not myself.) Jim Carrey is filming a "schtick" and pulls me to him to be a part of it. I mimic his crazy faces. I am very agile and do physical comedy that works well. After the moment is over (one move is that I was pretending to wrap my legs around him and hang on to him and then my feet walk up a brick wall and defying gravity.) After the schtick is over, I walk on down the street, aware I am late for a meeting. I have to have info for. Jim is now intrigued by me and my impressive acting skills. He follows me. I go into the bookstore. I rush around to get the info. A male co worker says hurry. You're late. I hen see Jim buying boxes of books. Books on lots of different subjects. I remember seeing some on boats and sailing. He is trying to impress me. I hurry across the street to a coffee cafe where the meeting is being held. As I go in, I see Jim doing funny movements on the street. I enter the cafe chuckling at his antics. I see a number of long tables and every customer along the tables turned, staring out the window at Jim in curiosity. Then they pretend they aren't interested when they see me come in. I find my meeting group in a window corner area. I begin talking to a Mr. , the boss who will be angry I am late. I say I've already written as book script for a movie (It's title is "Back To Win.") I work hard to convince the boss not to be angry at me and to make the book into a movie. Or I am pointing out it was a popular movie and I wrote it. I am very articulate and persuasive. (323 words)

["Tap dancing with Ellie."] I am living in a small cottage. I am learning tap dancing. I cheerfully challenge Ellie or she joins in as I do a riff. She'd follow my rhythm and we enjoyed doing "dueling tap dance routines." We were doing this on a small narrow cement sidewalk just in front of the small cement steps and porch in front of the house. We were waiting for the arrival of relatives to a reunion we are hosting. Now I envision a narrow cement sidewalk up the middle of the lawn. We tap up and down that. I am making up new steps and rhythms. Heel, toe, flop flop, etc. I see an odd convertible sports car driving up the road and stopping in front of our yard. No one is in it. I am quite surprised. Then another car drives up and at first I think it is Patricia but it is her sister Suzanne in the passenger side. She is using a remote control to drive the cars. I am amazed. She parks the cars a bit crookedly. More relatives visit. I go into the house. One of my Aunts calls me over to a table with many small jigsaw puzzles laid out. She smiles and gently challenges me to try to put them together. My mother had been doing it and just went outside. I shrug and sit, looking at the pieces. They are white background with simple black line drawings of various zoo type animals. I find I can do this. (253 words)

["Red haired rapist."] A red headed man sneaks up to my bedroom window. I am hurt, lying in bed and realize he is a rapist. I grab my phone and call 911. I can't remember my address. I say I am within a quarter mile or a hundred yards of a state park. It feels like the same location as the reunion dream, but not the same house. He comes into the house and talks to me, telling me to let him have sex with me. I try and fight, pulling his hair hard. He threatens to hurt me more if I struggle. I am trying to fight hi off and also aware I'd want to have sex. These feelings are within me. (120 words)

I have returned from someplace with an injury and now I must sleep up on the roof of a small cottage. I am lying on the narrow flat part of the roof. I am uncomfortable. I have a slim blanket and no pillow. I am afraid I will, in my sleep, roll over and fall off the roof and badly injure myself. It is miserable. I have to be there until I heal. I in desperation look around for a safer more comfortable place to sleep. I stand up, although it seems I shouldn't be able to. I look out and over to the next small cottage and then my "parent's house." All these are owned by my parents. I walk over these roofs looking for a better safe place to sleep. I don't find anything. I walk into my parents' where I used to have a room. I see a man and I think it is my brother Dwight. I suspect he's leaving and I call out to him You'd better not leave without saying goodbye to me or I'll be upset. He hesitates and returns to sit in a chair near where I lay. He confesses he's decided to leave his family. I suddenly realize it's not Dwight but some other man. I say, "I know" and he says How? Did you call my nephew? I say no. I didn't do it. I am relieved it is not Dwight's and embarrassed that in my pain, I didn't recognize him. He had black dreadknot curls in his hair. Lydia does some math calculating to try and get me to stay in my room rent free. She shows me the figures. I don't believe it is possible that I can stay without cheating. (293 words)

["Going to school again? Why?"] I live with my parents. I am downtown "M City." I have decided to take a college class of math at B City College. I need to take a test at Voc. Rehab which is at the post office. I have to get into a crate area that is the elevator. I crawl over the rail to get into the barred area as it is moving. I see Betty Cat is with me and I hold her as she snuggles. I must remember to tell my mother she's wandering off clear downtown now. I get to the basement. A man is there working and pays no attention to me. I call out to him that I want to take the 7 hour test. I need to take for that class. Even as I say this, I am wondering why I am doing this. I remember signing up to do high school again and then didn't go to classes for that. The man tells me I can do the test on Tuesday or Thursday from noon to 5:30pm. I sigh, and decide to do it now, as it is Tuesday. I don'' want to do this, but I'' doing it anyway. I hold my cat and cuddle her. (207 words)

["War ships and music."] I am seated close to an ocean on the sandy beach. I see warships like USS Cole plowing through the waters. I like being so close to the water since I can't walk to actually BE there. I am glad I can see so closely. Now Charla comes and disrupts the sand. I withdraw some distance, unhappy to have to move away from the ocean. I have a guitar and am trying to play it. Another person has a different type of guitar. I try to show them how to play it. Unusual set of strings. Ones more like a bass guitar. I enjoy plucking out rhythm and melodies. (109 words)

["Nate makes me sad."] I am in an unusual world. A sort of Saturday Market, only with secret entrances to another level. Only certain people can use the secret entrance. I am standing at a chicken wire kind of fence. Looking out, away from the Saturday Market area. A tall man in a black long hooded robe. It has orange colored squarish designs. He stands very close to me. I turn and look at his face. It is Nate. I want to touch him and hug him. I lean toward him but he shrugs and turns and walks away. I feel great with sadness. Again he leaves me unsatisfied. I feel longing and sorrow. I try to shrug it off and go on. I walk up an odd wall where the second to last square is the secret entrance to the lower level. I step into a swirling funnel and get sucked down to the lower level. A cop tries to follow me but can't get through. The entrance would not accept him. (169 words)

["Soft sweet flavors and sweet emotions."] I am in a cafe sitting in seats like in school. A waitress sits on my left. I am trying to write her a complement letter. Dear "One" as in Number one. I write. Then I can't think of anything more to say. Another woman reads and copies a paper I have there, a form. She feels embarrassed and hands it back. A group of women are getting ready to go outside for a little tour walk. I am going to join them. A pudgy short man, a "director" comes in and I pick up a flower design off a cow and sniff it. He does too. It is sweet and delicious. Together we begin to explore as we go on this tour walk and share our delightful flavors and smells with each other. A sweet tender friendship quickly forms. We agree to continue this together after the tour. I accidentally hug him. I am so happy with this connection. Our plump fronts touch and we feel embarrassed and look away. I pull back. Now we leave the tour to go on our own to the next taste treat. Somehow it never happens. His male friends tease him about how silly it is and we sadly separate. I see the women's group going in and I hesitate. Maybe I'll follow them in. I wait hopefully for the good soft warm feelings to return, but it all slowly evaporates. (238 words)

["Physical therapy. Better get going."] I am trying to do exercises of my feet. I use a sort of stair step device. A dog is friendly and nearby. I tell someone he belongs to some people who live with me. A Doctor or physical therapist follows me around, concerned and talking about a possible problem with some of the bones, muscles and joints in my right foot. He names a part or a technique I should be concerned about. (74 words)

["Transformation is happening."] I am in a meeting conference room. A group I belong to like "CDBG." Many members are showing up. A full room. It's the beginning of a new term. People are talkative and pushy, demanding I behave like them. I do not want to. I don't like the way they are following rules without thinking things over themselves. The room is sort of at the end of a series or a long hall of rooms like in a train. The table I'm at goes around and take turns giving their speeches. A few of us are left. We decide to fly our tables up the hall corridor to the front. It's kind of fun. Now we will get some breakfast. So, some man wants me to "comply" with the program. A black man on my right slaps me on the arm. I say don't hit me. He does it again. I say I am going to kick you and then I do. He is very upset with me. I point out I am the honest one. I tell him what I'm going to do and then do it. He just sneaks up and hits. Another man tries to convince me to do the program so I can finally win or earn my sheriff shoes. I laugh saying I don't want sheriff shoes. He is shocked. Why do I do this for me. I say. Because I want to. (238 words)

["Lucid flying."] I am suddenly aware I am in a hypnogogal state and become interested in the images floating by. I feel very envious and excited. I know there are so many I will not remember them all and feel regret I will not. As I continue watching, I see colors and it evolves into a sort of "landscape" of objects. A planter on the left, a red object in it. Sort of buildings along a "sidewall." Then I realize I am lucid as well and get very happy. I look up and see a dark cloudy night sky, Oh, what fun. I can fly. I point my arms up to the sky and begin to fly up, feeling joy. As I go higher, the clouds lessen and I see some stars twinkling through. I headed for the starry deep space and love it. As I fly, I see that now I am over a dark ocean and fairly close to the surface. (As I was up in the air, I asked myself what would I like to see, to know.) (Nothing came to me.) As I skim over the dark ocean on a dark night, I become aware I could choose to dive into the water and explore. I feel resistance. It would be cold and I couldn't breath and potentially scary. Then I challenge myself to do it. I will it to happen, but I just can't do it. It seems too scary. Then everything is so dark I can't see anything. I am completely enclosed in dark. I am slightly worried but I fly with it anyway. (268 words)

["Mermaids and crabs."] I am in a radio station lobby. Waiting. A group of kids (teens are there. I think they are the Hallmark kids. They have lots of energy. They are messy. They've been eating and paper plates and so on are all over. I am trying to pick up the mess. It then falls off my lap. They help me get it off the floor. I am in my power wheelchair. I decide I want to take the garbage to the office area and throw it away. I try to find a door to the office. I struggle past furniture and stuff to one door. It is closed. I turn and retrace my route to the lobby. One of the Hallmark kids walks with me. They think I shouldn't go to the office. That'' the inner sanctum and I shouldn't interrupt. A tall thin man in a manual wheelchair dressed in a fancy white tuxedo wheels past me to the door I turned away from. I think of warning him but don't. I see another door, but it is too narrow for my chair. Then I find the door to the hall. I go in and turn right, down the hall. I enter the office at the end of the hall. I see a group of women in mermaid suits seated in a fake blue "ocean" and taking phone calls. I get the attention of one of them and hand her the small pile of papers and leaves "garbage" I'd collected. She opens an appointment book and says put it in here. I say really? Not sure that makes sense. She says sure, why not? I shrug and put them in. Then I ask her why they are dressed as mermaids when they are dealing with people on the phone who can't see them. She says Oh, we don't have to wear the mermaid suits. We can wear our gym outfits or other costumes. I realize she hadn't really answered my question but don't pursue it. I turn and leave back down the hall. Dovre is with me now. I am carrying in my right hand a sort of orange spongy sea creature with a tiny yellow crab in it. It keeps trying to snip at me with its claws. Dovre is excited about a product for sale. She wants me to buy it. She points to the box (we went into a room on the right) and says see, you can get fireworks. I say to her, I don't want fireworks. She continues to express with enthusiasm how wonderful fireworks are. I say if you want this, you buy it. I then ask her if she wants to hold the crab as it is trying to snip me. She says no thanks. I carry it looking for a place to get rid of it or put it down. I am annoyed with Dovre. (483 words)

["Hypnogogic images."] Lush growing plants like in my front window. As I was aware I was in the hypnogogic state I examined them and saw they were slightly different kinds of leaves. The background is a plate glass window. This image is in the top left corner of a dark purple background. I enjoyed looking at them and thought about how this is a good image that represents growth and health and healing. Another image comes. White with textured swirls. I become aware it's a ceiling. I wonder if my eyes are open and then I know I am seeing a mental image. It goes away. I think how interesting that was a ceiling. Then it pops back up as I thought about it. Another image. A lacy crocheted white rose. Very pretty. (131 words)

["Radio dreams."] I am a child with other children in a school room. I decide to teach them something. I begin talking on my subject. But some radio is playing. A woman's voice is reporting something. I feel annoyed. I look to my right and see an open door to the hall and see some adults standing around sort of watching. I like that they are seeing me teach. I walk toward the door so they can see me better. But the door closes. I feel annoyed. I walk back to the round table where the other kids are. I ask them to turn off that radio. They pay no attention to me at all. I decide to find it and turn it off myself. I feel embarrassed I haven't better control of them. I find a small radio and find the off button but it doesn't work. I find another larger black radio with many many wires. One by one I follow the wire with my hand and yank out the ones plugged in the wall. Nothing helps. The radio keeps on talking. I feel very frustrated. [NOTES: I wake up to NPR news on the radio.] (187 words)

["Crazy man wont go away."] I decide to move into a New York apartment. I find my apartment door and open to discover it is a very tiny room. In fact two different apartment doors open onto the same tiny space. I am very disappointed. I go next door and peek in. It's a nice room. The woman says hi. She walks me down the hall to the next room which is huge and spacious, a sort of community sitting room we can use sometimes. A man in a towel and shower cap steps out. I feel embarrassed. He doesn't seem to mind there are people in his room. We go out into the hall. I step down the large steps and try and find my own apartment doors. It is hard. But I find them and go in. I stand there trying to figure out how to place the furniture. A man, plump and round, and short, with a very round head with short curly almost fuzzy hair knocks on my door and then walks right in. I say hey, this is my apartment. He ignores me. I feel afraid. I think he is a crazy man. I edge out of the apartment and go to the next door apartment. The woman invites me in and I say can I use your phone? There is this weird guy out here. She says sure.. The crazy round man comes right in and he has a son, a smaller version of himself with him. He won't leave. I pick up the phone and say in hushed tones 911. A woman answers and I whisper the address, and they need to come right away because this crazy man wont leave and he might be harmful. I stand there holding the phone waiting for a response. Meanwhile, the son is gone and a baby girl with his same fuzzy hair is there. I pick her up and she is very affectionate. She puckers up and gives me sweet kisses on the cheek. I see the shirt she is wearing has her name on it. Nadia Davis. And a bunch of writing indicating she is from the Catholic charities. I wonder if this is valid information or if the man dressed her like that to fool people. He is standing very close and glaring at me. I feel nervous.. I cuddle the baby trying to ignore the man as I wait for the 911 people to answer. No one comes. (411 words)

["Al Gore dream."] I am still in the New York apartment building of the last dream. The young wife, like Helen Hunt, with red hair, had tried to decorate her tiny apartment. I went in and saw two low couches in garish colors, a golden fur cover on one and multiple colored fake fur on the other. She says this room is too small. She is very disappointed and upset trying to make the furniture work. I sit on one couch, complaining that I will never be able to get out of it because of my knees and she will have to help pull me out. I see the other couch right across from me, the multicolored one is higher and wished I had sat on it. Then I see the baby girl. My god, I said. You had a baby. She smiles distractedly at me. I look more closely and see it is just like the baby the crazy round man of the last dream had with him. I am shocked. You stole a baby? I exclaim. She denies it, trying to change the subject. I say you can't just steal a baby! What will your husband think. Are you going to tell him it's his or that you stole it? She is very upset and won't answer me. She walks out of the room and across the hall. I follow her. We step into a tiny closet sized room and I say to her you have to do something. She paces, wildly thinking it over. She says but it does have red hair, like me. Now we return to her tiny apartment and her husband, Al Gore is there. The round man from the previous dream comes in and is now her brother. He says that's the same baby I stole. You have to give it back. Al looks confused. Helen says you're right. I will. But I really like her. I say she's a good kisser. The baby puckers up and kisses sweet baby kisses at Helen. We agree she is cute. Helen takes the baby to return it to it's people. Al Gore sits down suddenly on the multi colored couch and shakes his head quizzically. He says to himself in unbelieving accents, "He actually fixed a problem: referring to the dead beat brother, as he is usually the problem, not a solution maker. Al is disappointed in himself for not figuring it out himself. A woman from the democratic reception room comes in and says we need you in the reception room right now. Al tiredly gets up and goes. I follow along and pop into a long room with tables set up with snacks etc. on them. I hurriedly check the signs to make sure I am in the democratic room, not the republican one. I am in the democratic room. I see many people all dressed up in weird pink cellophane wrap costumes lining up to go out and rally for Gore. They are all tall and look like giant bottles shapes would look like if wrapped in cellophane with a ribbon tied at the top. They pass me in single file. An organizer woman says to me can you walk? I say not for long, but I could wheelchair it, except for all the stairs. No good, she says. There are stairs at the door. I wander over to the snack table which is nearly empty saying under my breath. There are stairs everywhere. I look over to Al Gore hoping he heard me, as that is something he should be fixing. He is of course paying attention to the campaign people and didn't hear. The woman asks if I want a snack and I see the large red and white sausages and say, no, there's nothing here that I can eat, what with my Atkins diet. I leave and return to the tiny apartment. Now the woman that used to live next door has moved in with Helen, Al Gore and myself. We have a second small room adjoining the tiny one. She and Al are in the tiny room talking. The woman says she sure wishes she could have her own place there is no privacy here. I step into the next room to look at what's in it. A piano, some odds and ends of furniture. No bed. I wonder where we will all sleep. I look into an open doorway and see a shower room. I say so that's what a roll in shower room would look like. It is white and bare and ugly. No toilet, just a big shower. Then a stream of water pours down on me at the doorway. Hurriedly I back away saying and its wet. Now the water is spraying out all over the room with the piano. I call out for help. Al comes in and looks but doesn't do anything. A maintenance man rushes in and tries to fix it but now the water rushes out in a major stream, knocking him over. I notice his bare butt as he washes past me. (850 words)

["Party time."] I am at a huge party. Lots of couples. Romances are starting up, dancing, broken hearts as couples find their partners getting together with new people. It is a house of many rooms. At one end there is a pivoted angle. Later I am the woman giving the party. I go from room to room hosting. One room is a bedroom where exhausted revelers are resting. One is a fuzzy yellow eyed "alien." I wake him and say its 4:00. You might want to rejoin the party. He's too tired and sleepy. I move on out to a kitchen with 4 stoves in it. I become aware that's a dream image. (111 words)

["Shards of multi-colored glass in my mouth."] I own a business of some sort. Alan Alda and I are there. He is a medical Doctor. We are friendly. He wants me to go with him to see the area where the employees are doing arts and crafts projects in their free time. Maybe we'll play and have fun there. We walk over to a table area and I notice a small shard of colored glass is on my finger. I had touched the table surface with my hand and a piece stuck to me. Someone had been doing a cut glass project. I carefully take it out of my finger and see more shards on the table. I want to move on someplace more safe but Alan is interested in showing me something there. I notice another shard. I pull it out, then another and then I am in bare or stocking feet and get some on my toes. I am worried. Alan stands there observing. I want him to help me but he doesn't. More and more I find the shards. Red, green, blue ones. Then one is in my mouth. That distresses me as I might swallow it and cut my throat inside. I carefully remove it, Then more and more until my mouth is full of them. I must be very careful swallowing. I am worried and Alan simply watches. I'm pulling out bunches of them now. I say to him, I need a restroom. He vacantly looks around. I see a sink and try to rinse these shards out of my mouth. It's becoming scary. (262 words)

I am at school, entering a class room. A young man is setting up a tall rectangular clear plastic box. Several musicians are setting up to play music. The man asks me sympathetic questions about when did I play music myself and too bad I can't do that anymore. I tell him about my Rheumatoid Arthritis and how my fingers were deformed and I had to give up playing instruments. I tell the story nostalgically and he is empathetic. Later, he and I are going to sing a song together. We'd worked on a bit. A sort of impromptu moment. We begin to sing and falter as we both forget the words. We look at each other for guidance on the next word. Finally we stop and sit down. I say to the small group of people listening "He forgot the words." Nobody seems upset or cares. I even feel relaxed about it. (153 words)

["The blue fish story."] I am seated mid-air, listening to some lecture or some offer being made that could be good for me (or whoever gets it). A small fuzzy slipper shaped yellow and black stripped creature (there are 2 of them) zip around in the air. One of them comes to me and holds tightly to the bottom of my left foot. As it presses snugly up against my heel, I feel it humming and vibrating vigorously. It is intense, almost uncomfortable, but I also feel a bit honored it is doing this. I seem to understand it is trying to help me to get the offered thing the lecturer is talking about. Then the creature flies me fast up to the ceiling and back down to where I was seated in the air. It repeats this a number of times. I am concerned I will bump my head on the ceiling but it never happens. Now he pulls me down to the floor near the offer being made. I repeat this several times. Then he flies me around the room. I am concerned I am distracting the lecturer or disturbing the few other people there also seated in mid-air. Then the creature brings me to the place where the lecturer is. Only, now there is a large poster with some instructions and graphics. I am thought instructed to push the area marked G2. I push it, a little confused which area is the right one to push. It lights up with blue light. Apparently I've entered to try and get the offer. Now two young business men are speaking. They are explaining the offer they will give people. Land, a house and help them get started to build their lives as they wish. The second young man cautions them everyone not to get too complacent and expect everything to be supplied to them. They must help themselves and be active workers on their project. Now it seems I have won the offer. I am given a small package to open, but first I notice the two fuzzy creatures are wrapped uncomfortably in red clothes. I help them by removing the red coverall wrappers so they are free. Then I unwrap the package. A blue fish (the size of a goldfish is there, no water. I realize I need to get it in water. I carry it quickly to a kitchen sink and grab a red/gold bowl and pour water from the faucet. I then notice it is warm water which might harm the fish. So I adjust the water to cold. The blue fish slips into the sink where the water is warm. I scoop him out and into the small fish bowl of cold water. He turns into a gold fish and swims around. Then the bowl is a large aquarium tank. The fish swims around. I see two parts of a dead fish like a trout in there. At first I want to remove it but then realize it will be food for them. I see a few small mosquitos and put them in the tank for food. There I see a cricket and scoop him in there for the fish. The fish is apparently a good special thing that will bring me good things and happiness. (547 words)

["Crocodile."] I am visiting a house where my mother lives. It is on a river. A patio door opens right onto the river. I stand at the open door and look down into the river. The current is swift as it passes under the house. I look at the bottom of the river and ask how deep it might be. I speculate the river might be 4 feet deep. I feel a twinge of worry that I could fall in and be swept away by the current. I stick my right foot into the water. A large black crocodile appears very close to my foot. I realize my foot is in danger. I know I need to quickly pull my foot out of the water and step back but I don't. I struggle with myself mentally and finally slowly pull my foot back into the house. I step back and the crocodile comes up into the house. Now it is a crocodile boy and walks two legged. It is dangerous to have him in the house. I don't know what to do to get him out. I follow him around to try and keep him from doing any damage. Now a man and a woman come in. They intend to do damage to the top of the chimney so we will be driven out by smoke and then they will steal things. I see clouds of white smoke starting to build up and descend down toward us. I see her reaching from the chimney top to grab at objects on a shelf to steal. She is a clown/comedic performer. I am angry at her. I tell her to stop. She laughs and ignores me. Now she is in the house and doing a comedy performance to a small group of people. I stand on the side angrily watching. I want her to leave. Somehow I take over the performance area and try to do her routine from her notes. I fumble along adlibbing as best I can. I do OK, but it's a bit lame. She watches sort of pulling me down, but a small bit of respect is there. I come off the "stage" and say to a friend, she didn't even have a script. Only some pictures. That was hard to do. I am mellowing my attitude about her as well. Now I'm in another room. My mother comes in and says look at my new hair cut. I tell her I like it. It makes her look years younger. At first it looks like a page boy bouffant style. Her hair is brown. As I look more closely, I see her hair is buzz cut on the left side as she faces me and there are hair stubble on her cheek. The top is combed over to the right and then curls down around her ear. The stubble is unattractive and I am very surprised at the modern buzz cut style. This is not usual for my mother. (500 words)

["Aliens kill nightmare."] I/a woman is entering an airplane. The dream ego is watching from behind her. I see her feet stepping into the raised carpeted stairs in the aisle as she steps down each step like in a raked seating situation. She walks to the front. She turns to the right and pulls out a black pistol and fires into the chest of a passenger, male. A man stands up and also pulls out a gun and begins to kill passengers. Between the two they kill every passenger. Then they throw the bodies out the windows on one side. They are aliens. Another I (the dream ego) is in another airplane, in the cockpit. The Captain tensely says to his crew to lock the door. I see people falling out of the other airplane. The crew member nearest the door is afraid and fumbles as he tries to lock the door. The lock turns and holds. They know it's aliens and they are next. I wake up afraid. (166 words)

["Dream program presentation."] I am at an ASD conference. It's the middle of the night. I'd been working hard on my dream program and the research on my dreams. A man, friendly and attracted to me, is very interested in the findings of my work. I tell Charla my granddaughter she needs to go to bed now. I shut down the computer even though the man is still very interested in my dream program work. I need to leave to give my presentation. I am now at the conference. I walk up a few steps to the stage area and to the podium. I look down at the audience noticing the high backed pews they are sitting in. They seem to be a it far away. I begin my talk. I am aware of a pile of papers on the podium. A bit messy. I wonder where I should start. I begin to describe how we can search a root word and get all the syntaxed versions of the word.. I proudly announce I have a 15,000 word dictionary, melted down from my... I mean Barbara Sanders... many dreams over 25 years. I see audience members smiling at my slip of the tongue I make the same slip often. I'm not fooling anyone. I begin to talk about the category system, how it started with the Hall/van De Castle system. About this time, I realize I'm getting enthusiastic about describing how my dream program works and how I created this and this. I shift the topic to the research results, which is the main topic of the presentation. I announce I am very excited about the results of my research. I studied my...Barb Sanders nightmares. I found a very high pattern of the feeling "resistance."` and not fear or disgust as I had expected. Then I found a high level of a "sense of peace" This really interests the audience. I say, let me show you the results on the transparency. I look to my right and realize the assistant did not have the overhead projector set up. I rush over and try to find the transparencies and do it myself. I see piles of them and leaf through them but don't find mine. I am aware I could lose the audience with this distraction and go back to the podium and continue with my presentation without the transparencies saying perhaps the assistant is merely late and will yet show up. He never shows up and I continue the presentation. (417 words)

["Get out of my way."] I am a young well built woman wearing a red business style suit. I walk into a room to be at a workshop. I am a bit late and the room is so crowded that many women are standing. I squeeze in I am way in the back behind all the other women. I can't see very well. I keep trying to get a better look at the presenter. I'd heard he is a very handsome man and an excellent presenter. When ever I see a glimpse of him, I am not happy with his appearance. He seems short and not particularly handsome. I try and change how he looks. I think "Michael J. Fox" but he doesn't really improve. As he speaks, slowly the crowd shifts or decreases enough so that he can see me. I am aware of how good I look and he does notice. He is attracted to me. After the workshop, he comes over to talk with me. We are interrupted in our attempt to get to know each other by a disabled man with CP. He wants some assistance getting things organized so he can manage better independently. The handsome man isn't too helpful but he does try. The disabled man is impatient with the handsome man. After a desk has been moved and organized better, the handsome man lies on the floor I follow over to where he is, but the disabled man insists that I watch him. The disabled man felt that the handsome man had slowed him down or blocked him from showing me how fast he can move on a push cart. The disabled man gets on the push cart and goes to the opposite end of the room from me. He says look. I feel a bit annoyed or thwarted because this is getting in the way of me approaching the handsome man. It takes time to stop and watch him and the path of the push cart is between me and the handsome man. The disabled man doesn't wait for me to respond. He rushes as fast as he can across the room having to avoid hitting the prone handsome man. I say impatiently to the disabled man (over my shoulder as I continue to walk toward the handsome man) Great. You did that in 3 seconds (which really is impressive and fast.) (395 words)

["Helping the horse."] I am at a sort of apartment building, staying for a week or so. I am in a kitchen area. I am trying to pack my things to go home. I see a curio cabinet and remember I need to put things back in there the way it was before I arrived and moved them. As I'm looking around to get my things, an old "cowboy" comes in singing a country western song. I don't think he sings all that well. I leave the kitchen and start going up some flights of stairs. Some of the stairs go down but somehow the direction in general is up. The next flight seems broken. I try and arrange the boxes that make up the flight which is laying on a flat floor. Then I see an iron and an ironing board. I remember I need to iron my pink dress. A woman comes over and says Hi. She says too bad you're leaving. We could have been good friends. She's an artist. I agree. She leaves. I iron the flounce on the hem of the dress. The steam iron works well and gets the wrinkles out. Now I leave. I get on a beautiful powerful dark horse. He has lots of energy. I guide him to the edge of the cement highway. I hold him back from running as it's not a good safe surface for him to run. A car pulls in front of us and I look back to see if the traffic is clear so we can go around the car on the highway. I see a car but decide we have enough time and guide the horse out there. The horse refuses and pulls back. We fall. I get up and pull on the reins to get him up. I feel badly because he was right. It was dangerous to go out there. I start to get on him. I pat his neck affectionately. He looks at me and then looks at his feet. I know he's trying to tell me something. I look at his feet and say do you need the ankle taped? He nods. I say which one. He points his nose at the left rear one. I see a black plastic piece on the road and pick it up. He nods yes. I say OK. I'll go get some tape. I walk up a graveled driveway and see an old shed garage and go in. I see a man putting up his rock band equipment. On his right a sort of biker is fixing things. I see a roll of scotch tape. I go to him and ask if I can borrow some tape. He's grumpy and complains about people who take from others. I say to him, forget it, I don't need this crap, as he started to reach out to shake my hand. He quickly pulls his hand back. I realize I'd blown it. Seems he changed his mind and was going to give me the tape. I say never mind, I'll find tape from someone else and walk out. I see an open door on my left. A woman lies on the floor on her belly painting the bottom edge of the door. I ask her if I could borrow some tape. She thinks about it and says yeah, she had some special tape. She rolls or crawls on her belly over inside and gets a sheet of textured tape and carefully cuts a short piece. I needed one longer but decide to make do with it. She gives it to me and gets distracted by a small hole in her wall at the baseboard. She exclaims over and over at something she sees in there. I get the impression its mice or bugs. Oh dear, oh dear! She says. Then she tells me she's an artist and a vegan. I lean in to see what she sees. "A squirrel" I say. I thank her for the tape and return to the horse and carefully wrap his ankle with the black plastic and the tape. The biker guy had followed me and he sees I really did need the tape for a good reason. He feels badly he didn't help. (709 words)

I have a brother. He and his friend, a Tim Allen type, comes by. They are carrying some items of importance to them. Ceramic figures in a box. We three go down a road carrying this box carefully. It is important to them nothing gets broken. This has to do with a sport they love and maybe play. Tim is playful and silly. We walk a long way. Then the pieces become rattled and more damage to some of them. My brother and Tim are upset. I sigh. I have no respect for Tim's sports antics and jokes. My brother wants me to like his friend. It is night and we find a tiny light to see how bad the damage is to the ceramic figures. We go up to a house and use their porch to pull the figurines out. I work carefully to try and fix them. Tim keeps up a steady patter of silly talk and finally says something that offends me. I refuse to speak to him. He keeps trying to get me to talk to him, conjoling me and teasing. Now we are carefully packing all the figures back in the box. I am relieved we didn't wake up the owners of the house. My brother calls in a few more of his sports buddies to help us carry all these things. I find one more figurine on the porch. I wrap it carefully in the box. The new friend now does a rhythm thing and a chant. My brother says it is important, like a blessing on the box of figurines. He wants me to not be such a grump and join in. I grudgingly try to chant and listen. Tim wants me to be a good sport. (294 words)

["Stealing my things."] I live in a house. People start coming in the back door without permission. 1st it's one, then another and more and more. They are taking things and leaving, then returning for more. I am angry at them and a little scared, but I do try and stop them. I call out to them to stop. They ignore me. I stand in front of one plump big guy and try to block his way. He threatens me. I feel afraid of him, but I don't back down. I just hope he doesn't hurt me too badly. He walks around me and continues to take things. I decide to call 911 for the police, realizing as I thought it that of course it won't work it never does. But I try anyway. I never even find the phone. Finally I give up. They're too many of them and what the hell, maybe I'll be better off without all this stuff anyway. (160 words)

I am in a room where a woman is standing facing us and we are seated, like school. She is giving us instructions on how to properly take this test. This has something to do with the elections because I can hear a voice droning on about the elections. I am not really paying attention. I don't think I planned on actually doing the test. At the last minute I decide to do it, so I look carefully at the paper on my desk and look up to see the example. There are two parts. One of the parts is called "Checker." I must compare patterns and choose from #1 or #2. #1 is red and #2 is orange. I have to describe how they are in relationship to each other. I use the < and > signs to say orange has less intensity than red. I then see a drop of lotion. I try to wipe it away. It is bigger now and I keep wiping at it and it keeps getting bigger and bigger. A big messy drippy puddle of lotion now all over my cat Bootsie. The cat looks emaciated very lean and skinny, naked of fur with enormous yellow eyes, the black pupils dilated and huge. I hold her over the waste basket to let the lotion mess drip off her. Finally I get it all in the waste basket. (231 words)

["The blind helping me find the bathroom."] I am walking down a graveled lane trying to get to my "room." Maybe I'm at a resort. I need to go to the bathroom. Mirabelle is walking with me. I tell her if we take the lane to the right that goes steeply uphill, we will find the accessible bathroom. She wants us to go to our accommodations first to put away the groceries. I need to pee, but agree. We get to our room. I go in. Mirabelle is outside still saying how happy she is to help me out. That's what friends are for. She asks me to hand her the salad on the counter. I look in the sink and see packages of bacon and hamburger. So I think this is supposed to be in the refridge. I look and see "keep refrigerated" on the bacon package. I carry them over and put them in the fridge. I see a few cut carrots and some lettuce on a plate and carry it to the patio door and look down (one story). A blind man (Steve) steps toward the window. I direct him verbally. Its 2 more feet, now there's a curb. He's going to also help me find the restroom. (204 words)

I am in a spacious kitchen. The appliances are fancy like you'd find in a wealthy person's mansion. I am looking at the garbage disposal, the label that tells you about the updates you will receive. I see bananas fresh and yellow in bins stacked very tidily. I am touched the kitchen staff has been keeping bananas there for me even though I can't eat them now on the Atkins diet. I see one that is blackening and decide to use the garbage disposal. I pull off the peel. The banana breaks in half. It is dry and old. I can't figure out how to use this fancy disposal. I now lie on the floor to figure it out. As I am there, a door opens and a series of disabled people with limps and braces and cp walk in. Everyone is dressed up for a party. They are in a party now, laughing and hugging each other. They are going to a room across the hall from the kitchen. I think about joining them. It would be nice to find a mate. Here's an opportunity. I see one young woman repeatedly intensely hugging a young man in a bright yellow suit jacket. I realize these are also mentally retarded people. She comes over by me. Now I am in my wheelchair. She grabs the handles of the chair and tips me back. I say, startled, Do not touch my chair again. Then I go off to the party room. I don't. (252 words)

A Mexican General Reillo is a dictator. He is cruel and harms the people. I am camping out in the country there. I show a photo of how brown and arid the semi desert area of Central Mexico is. But I notice there are trees and a river where I'm camped. I even swim in the river, enjoying the cool wet swim. Now I'm in a hospital bed. I'm exhausted. I want to get up but seem unable to. I am so tired. Paulina comes in and I say, "I can't seem to get up." she says. Why should you. You're still recovering. I feel better about it after she says that. Then they (my daughter) get me in a van (like VW). We are sitting parked next to a river. The windows are open and mosquitoes are coming in, lots of them. I ask them to close the windows. I smash some of the mosquitoes but there are lots of them. No one moves to shut the windows In annoyance I reach over and struggle to shut the windows. (180 words)

["Manna from heaven."] I am hungry. I see Bill Clinton's face in the sky. He is doing a spell to pull fish from something. I see a long line of fish coming out and falling to earth. They come near where I am. I wait eagerly for a fish to fall near me so I can eat it. As I watch, the fish turn into seals. One lands on a tall white church on a ledge, then 4 or 5. They will get away. If I don't hurry and catch them. (88 words)

["Nude notes."] I am talking to a well developed teen. She and her friends are talking. She says in her nude modeling class they take nude notes at the teacher's request. I think she wants to shock me. She also says If I'd known boys obsess on big breasts, I'd have bought a different bikini. I then enter the conversation and say yes, boys really like big breasts. And I feel empathy for them in the nude notes situation because they are more vulnerable than the girls. What do you mean one teen asks. I say because they never know when they will have an erection. 2 teen boys are there. I wonder if it is appropriate for me to be talking about sexual stuff like this with these young teens.

I hesitate and then say, "Yes, you need to guard her. She escapes every chance she gets. In my mind's eye, I see her already escaping from the fields. (106 words)

["Tired and sleepy."] I am on a grassy gentle rolling hill meadow. There is a group of young women, one is Anita B. from high school. They are a group I join in with late. They all ready have their official pen given to group members. Mine looks different than theirs. There are at least 2 "monk" like teachers, male. I lie down on the grass. I feel so tired and sleepy. I can't seem to keep my eyes open. The monks encourage me to get up and join in activities with the women. I groggily get up. Anita B. hugs me and does this rocking hug that is like dancing. She moves us up the grassy slope to where the women already had their school desks, hidden under the surface of the grass. They dig down to reveal the "pigeon hole" desks. I see their pens are wrapped in pink tissue paper, mine is in white. I ask why wrapped in pink. Anita says because that indicates things that glow. (168 words)

A small group of people come in and I want to share with them the video tapes of this years performances at the celebration. (Like E City Celebration) They become bored and I say well, then shall we look at the 1st one, 3 years ago? (I remember I'd done some performing in my sexy pink dress and want to show that.) They agree. I ask a man in the group to run the remote control. I say each segment is repeated so be sure and fast forward those parts. (153 words)

Charla and I are in a play together. It's the life story of an important inventor. I roll on stage. 2 males are there. Charla comes in after me. I'd forgotten my lines and try to go back stage and get a script. I find one and rush back. I begin the narrative story of his life. I can't read the script so I struggle to remember the chronological order of events. I point to a picture of a sail boat and I say that's one of my favorite toys. But I did not like the power boat. Then I leave the stage to fly a short circle. Charla follows me. I get in a round thing and it goes up and around and down. I nearly crash it. I rush back to the stage. I comment there were many ways I could have crashed! Charla is rushing to catch up. I go on stage, wishing I'd waited for a moment for Charla to get into proper position.

The students are seated in a crowded "jury box" style of seating. As I walk around the outside edge lecturing. I realize I need to be closer to them, to connect, to be a better teacher. I lean in and put my arm around the shoulders of students and talk directly toward them. They like that better. Now I am on stage teaching a larger group I am teaching them how to be good farmers. I look at the back of the audience and see my mentor Katherine Hepburn. I am pleased and honored she is there. I walk back to her and greet her. Then I return to the stage. I call on a student to come up there. I ask him questions. I say, can you tell me when it's a good time to harvest the green beans? He takes this as a cue as to what he's supposed to do and starts picking green beans growing on a fence on stage. He says stupidly, well, when they look big and there's a lot of them, then you pick them. (215 words)

I am in a large ship. I see a TV and wonder who's it is. I figure out it is Ellie's. Lots of my things are on this ship. Charla is there, as a baby. Ginny is there. Suddenly there is a loud explosion. The ship is blown into a billion pieces. I am now swimming in the water. I am desperately looking for something floating piece I can cling to. At first, I don't see any. Then I find a small white square of something. Now I am frantically searching for Charla and Ginny. I feel sad they are probably dead. I notice lots of my things on the bottom of the water. Before it was dark and deep but now it is shallow. I could probably stand up. I am near the shore. (like a lake.) I see wooden buildings of a camp near by. I get back to my home. I am very relieved to find Charla and Ginny there. Charla is about 9 months to a year old, all in white a sweet baby bonnet on her head. She is plump and chubby cheeked. I go to her and pick her up. Hugging her, I mention she has a Doctor's appointment. Ginny and maybe Ellie as a child start to walk down the street. They will meet us at Dr. Smythe's office. Bonnie and I follow. I'm carrying Charla. Bonnie becomes distressed. She thought we'd be riding in the van. She stops and complains its too far to walk. I say here's the key. You go back and get the van and meet me there. She agrees. Now I am carrying a small kitten, playful and sweet. I walk. The sidewalk becomes blocks of wood and I come to a wall. I hop down off the sidewalk onto the dirt street and walk. Now I am at the camp that I saw from the water. Three paths branch out from the one I'm on. One curves around the left back to the camp. One curves to the right. One goes straight. I walk it up the hill. It is steep. Then at the top, I get confused. I see to my right and down a small town. Maybe that is Dr. Smythe's office there. I see some people and ask them. They think I have to continue on, her office is at "Vine Maple Leaf" town. I don't know which way to go. I am standing on the edge of the hill and have to step back as my feet are sliding on the dirt like I'm going to fall off. I decide to go down to the small town and check there. The kitten is trying to leap out of my arms. (457 words)

["Engulfing waves."] I and 2 other people are standing watching huge "60 foot" waves crashing up over the top of a huge mountain peak. It is awesome in size and power. I am afraid I won't survive it. We decide our survival depends on enduring under the wave. We stand with some kind of air bubble plastic over us. We are surrounded by the pounding waters, engulfed. We hold our breath, waiting for the wave to pass and recede. We barely make it. The other woman keeps talking nervously as a wave hits. I am concerned she will use all the air. After a very large one, I say wow. I'll bet that was a 30 foot wave. A woman like our neighbor says with scorn, I measured it. It was only 28 foot. You didn't have your facts. I glare at her angrily. I felt put down. I mumbled I got pretty close on my guess. I turn and go inside a cave. Like deserting them. Then I turn and join them again for the next huge wave. After I survived that one, I decide to go out away from the mountain it might be safer. As I stand on the flat plains, a wave of high water surges at us only waist high. But as I watch, the wave over the mountain had picked up huge round boulders (black). They are rushing toward us. I turn and run for my life. Someone yells get behind something. I find a rocky outcrop and crouch behind it. The boulders that would have killed me crush and break up on my shield. I decide its safer right under the mountain. I return to there. (281 words)

["Making the house accessible."] I am moving into a very large house. I am very tired and sleeping on a couch in a living room. I am waiting for a couple of people who are going to help me move in and make he house accessible. I hear the people who just arrived. One is a man like Gary in a manual chair. I get up and walk around. I see the other man brought some children and cats and dogs. 4 or 5 cats are walking along the shallow edge of the swimming pool. Bootsie throws herself in. I call out a warning. Be careful. You'll get wet! She swims frantically to get out. Then a large furry golden colored dog dives in and swims across. The dog gets out and begins to shake herself all over. I groan. Oh, no. What a mess. Gary comes over. I hurriedly try to remember where I left my power chair. I feel it might embarrass Gary if I'm walking. I find it and follow him out to a porch and a flight of stairs. He's out of his chair sitting on the top step. I sit next to him. A tree is growing right out of the stairs. I sit right in front of the tree. A girl is pushing at the tree for fun. But the tree seems unstable and could fall over. I ask her to stop. Gary is telling me he can fix the annoying problem of the drapes which are so full. They get caught up in my wheels. I am very glad he can fix this accessibility problem. (268 words)

At one point I observe a policeman presenting a delicious all white cake with lots of sweet frosting to a young woman having a B'day. But I see the cop take the biggest and best piece out of the center and eat it. This is unfair, but the woman does not protest. I eat a small remaining piece. It is very sweet and soft and delicious. Now I see a large gargoyle statue climbing up an outside wall of this Greek like building. Some large being at the top kicks at some rubble and it all tumbles down on the gargoyle. Now a group of people are discussing issues. I watch one man in particular in the group. He watches me with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. We are attracted to each other. I listen carefully. Then someone from the group asks me a question. I am surprised because I'm not a member of the group. But I answer. The man wears a Greek fisherman's hat and moves closer. We are sexually attracted. Apparently at the end of this festive occasion there is a conga line dance and everything is sexual. He has a dildo massage unit and suggests we take turns with different ends on it to best pleasure each other. I'm looking forward to it. (235 words)

I am teaching a class in an old high school. The room is very large with high ceilings. There are many students. I am teaching English or Language Arts. As I am lecturing, students talk among themselves. I get up and walk around. I am annoyed and raise my voice. I continue lecturing. They escalate their voices and move around in groups, deliberately trying to be disrespectful and belligerent. I raise my voice. I tell them they must sit down now. They ignore me. Now we are full blown involved in a power struggle. I am very angry. I threaten them. I demand. I continue to talk. They are more disrespectful. Finally I stop talking and write on the board they will all be suspended. Go to the principal. They are already (some of them) out in the hall. I tell them they must write a 2000 word essay on civil disobedience due on January 2nd. They will flunk if it isn't handed in. They are now converging on me. I am out of control. Holding in my anger just barely. I wake up, still feeling angry. I can't let go of the feelings. (194 words)

I am in an open field or a university campus. Lots of students are there. A woman teacher is talking to the group. I am suddenly concerned I had forgotten to study for a mathematics class and maybe a science class. I feel a bit of panic. Then I relax and think oh, well, it's my last term. I'm not going to worry about it. If I flunk those classes, then I flunk. I see a plate full of hamburger gravel and corn. It is my left over mess. I start to put some water in it to scrub off the mess. Right in the middle of the field as the teacher talks to the students. Then a man talks. He is sharing how he came back to school after some time being out of school. He confesses he's in trouble. He didn't study, he partied and now he's on drugs and flunking. He tells his story. I and others feel great empathy for him as he slowly walks sadly away. I am now sweeping up a gravelly mess off the field like I'd been doing on the plate. A student runs after the man. I am relieved someone will try and help him. The woman teacher stands there staring at him. A Tom Hanks kind of counselor goes to him. Good. He will get some help. (227 words)

I am watching a young man like Matthew Broderick trying to figure out how to push himself around in a manual wheelchair. It is a very wide one for a fat person. It's so wide he's like a little boy in it, all squished down and stretching out his arms but he can't get the wheels to turn. So he tries sticking his leg out one side and his other leg out the other side so he can use his foot to push. That doesn't work either. As he struggles, I want to tell him the chair is too wide for him. I feel shy because I like him so I don't speak. Now I use my manual chair. I get around fine. He watches. I am rolling through a series of railroad cars with lots of strips of wood lying on the floor. It gets difficult so I say to him your chair is too wide. He gets defensive. I go out of the car into a tourist trap shop. I see examples of graphics that are "master shots" for film. I notice how all the elements are blocked so everything shows well. A narrator says kids these days don't know how to draw these and so can't compete to do films. I go into another room. A sort of display museum about this painted lady of the old days. She is a prostitute. I see a picture of 2 of them riding horses in their petticoats through a gang of men. It's a play. Now we are encouraged to pay some money to see the end of the play. A young man is on trial. I say to my male friend I don't know if I want to go see it or not. They've got my curiosity up, but I'm afraid they won't really tell us the end of the story honestly. I decide to go in, I am disappointed as I see the prostitutes preparing to throw 40 very hungry crabs into a swim pool throwing food to one which pounces on the live food and rips it apart in a feeding frenzy. She says she and the other women are going to dive in with these vicious crabs. I want to leave. What a rip off. (380 words)

I am standing in a small group of 4 people. I am explaining why a young man is having problems. It's because his mom has cancer. As I am breathing, I'd hear a snoring pig snort sound.

I am given a yellow pill to swallow and it gets stuck in my throat. I can't get it to go up or down. I ask he woman doctor for a glass of water. She sits quietly, refusing to give me the water. She thinks I'm being hysterical and not trying hard enough. I am angry at her and ask again. Again, she says no. While a part of me agrees I don't try hard enough sometimes, I am aware I've done all I can here. I demand an official complaint sheet. She hands me a book of them. They are different colored squares. Each one has a specific name on it. The first one is Anastasia. I can't find the one for the Doctor. (125 words)

I am standing on a square metal box, a large one. Six foot tall maybe. My volunteer job is to help a retarded young man in some activities. I am having trouble getting down off the box. Someone is telling me to hurry. I tell them I can't hurry. I need to be safe. The young man can wait. He does wait. I finally get down and go to him. He is very happy to see me. I devise a game. I put different sized balls down on the floor in a long hall. He laughs with joy. Now time is up. So I say Let's go pick up the balls now. I find 2 flat boxes to put them in. He comes with me and occasionally picks up a ball but I do most of the work. Lots of puzzle pieces too. I remind myself not to use so many small pieces next time. I am aware of how long this is taking. But it is important to complete the task. (172 words)

["Fixing the klieg light."] I am a crew member of a production. I see a huge bright colored klieg light has fallen down from the top center stage. It is oddly shaped like a set of airplane wings like you'd wear on a pin. Bright red and yellow colors. I ask the boss if he needs this light. He says yes. I turn it on and it is blindingly bright. Very powerful. I turn it off and call for a very very tall ladder. I climb carefully up. I am a bit scared of the height and cling tightly to anything I can to keep secure. I see a tiny nail where the light had been. No wonder it fell. I now tack it up with large brackets. It is there very solid. I turn it on and the light is again blinding. I ask the director in the control booth if he can control it. He grins and says yes. Then he asks me to come up there. I climb down the ladder and walk up the stairs to the lighting control booth. I go in. It is clear the director is interested in teaching me how to direct and use the lighting booth. I am pleased. (204 words)

["Domhoff conference."] I have traveled to California to spend a few days with Bill Domhoff and the graduate students again as they work on my dreams. We are standing on a sidewall outside the University buildings. Bill says on Tuesday we will camp out in a tent here. I find this unusual and strange but just say oh, OK. I wonder if the storm water grate at the corner will work for a toilet. Bill goes off to do something. Melissa, a grad student, stays with me to visit. I ask if we have any scheduled events that first evening. She doesn't know. Now a man gives me a ride. We talk as we travel through the huge cities streets. I get out and he goes on. I see what I thought was a bus stop. I cross the street to discover it's a street light. I now realize I'm stranded in the outskirts of a large city with no bus to get back. I'm in my power chair. I go to a gas station to ask if there's any buses down the road. The man is very busy. I get out of my power chair and get into a car in the backseat. Other people are in the car. It's being repaired. First the car is tilted up to the left and I roll over toward this man in the backseat. Then we are tilted to the right. It's like a carnival ride. Now I'm the only person in the car and it tips up on it more and twirls very fast. Now the ride is over and I get out. I hope my chair is parked safely out of the way of the car. Melissa is one of the people there. I tell her my predicament. She is concerned for me. I suggest that after her car is repaired we could put my chair in her trunk and I'd ride with her. She hesitates and then agrees but I know she's worried. She mentions a concern about her paint job being scratched up. I say to her directly I know you don't want to do this so I'll find another way. She is relieved but I am stuck. I say I'll have to hire a handicab and that will cost lots of money. Over $100. She is sorry for me but not helpful. I ask the man owner if I can use his telephone. He agrees. Then I burst into nervous tears. Melissa asks what's wrong? I say Oh, I'm just upset and hungry. I'll miss my dinner, The man says there's a restaurant near by. Melissa tells me it will be an hour before the handicab shows up. So we start walking to find the restaurant, me in my chair. I see through large glass windows a group of five male employees at another repair bay that are fighting. One of them sees me and thinks I am a customer. He is very anxious to explain why they are fighting and he tries very hard to stop the fighting. I wave my hands to indicate I'm not a customer. I am now sitting with Melissa on the street edge waiting for the handicab. I complain bitterly about how much it will cost and how in E City we have accessible buses everywhere. I wished I'd not ridden with that man. (561 words)

I rescue two weird bags that are connected somehow to important TV comedian energy. I ask them if they are willing to come with me. I don't want regular people to know I have them with me. I ask them to be quiet and not attract attention. After I plead with them about how important this is, they agree. I sneak them down raked bleacher seating. We get on an open elevator platform. Some boxes of their things are with us. I push the elevator button. I keep the glass door open so no one can stop the elevator and blow our cover. A white polar bear says It's a good thing you did that. I'm not fond of comedians. We go to a floor, overshoot it and stop. We are looking for Apt. #15. They panic because we don't find it right there. I insist we go down the hall and look. I find an open door and look in. A woman with her children says what? I say is this #15? She says no, but I'm thinking of moving soon. You can have this one. I say may we come in and look? She says OK. One room with a narrow hospital bed in the middle but the back room is huge. Real narrow doors. Too narrow for a wheelchair. A square area for the bathroom with all this space around it. (234 words)

["Gaston dies."] I am watching TV. I see a news story about Gaston. It's an interview. I see the lovely modern non cluttered look of the inside of his house. He is doing some silly trick of standing up on some logs near a fireplace and balancing. I am shocked to hear that he had just died. I feel sad. I also wonder if he left a will. Who will get his stuff? I'd like to get some of it, but I can't imagine he would have left any of it to me. I feel guilty for thinking so materially and selfishly. Now I am remembering a meeting he and I had before he died. We are meeting at a cottage off a country lane. He is very sweet and friendly. I am trying to remember if he gave any clues that he was going to die. (145 words)

["Moving to Alaska."] I moved to Alaska where I am staying with a woman and her husband. She works as a teacher in an elementary school. I go with her to try for a job there myself. We drive through the snow and mud for 10 miles. I am driving a van. A white one. It sure looks like we could get stuck. I'm nervous and careful. We slide through. I remember to keep the gas going fast so we don't bog down and get stuck. It's a curvy road. Then we stop and the woman takes off her high heels (She's wearing a light grey business suit). She walks barefoot in the snow. I wonder how she can stand it. We get into the school through a series of back porch doors. A male teacher is behind me and trying to help open the doors for me, but I hurry ahead and get them myself. I see the woman teacher who will interview me and I shake her hand, being friendly. Trying to impress her. I'll know I'll get the job. She asks which grades I'd prefer to teach. I answer 3rd or 5th. I like the older grades.

["Weird interview."] I am at a workshop for some social service agency. A man named "Bob" comes in and talks about his sort of public radio/TV/Internet agency. After the workshop I go over to a small room to do an interview for a job with his agency. He is friendly and talkative. He busies himself dusting the vent door near the ceiling where the computer stuff is stored. It is very dusty. I sympathize. He hands me a curved and long test paper to do. It is very wordy and doesn't ask the straight forward questions I expect. It is confusing and frustrating to fill out. I skip a few questions and have come back to do them. I struggle with my address. SE 40th or is it NW. I try to look it up on my driver's license and other cards. It's all wrong on them too. Then Bob comes back in and interrupts me. He has a rectangular cream colored purse. He thinks it's mine and I left it in another room. I tell him its not mine. I have my small black one (like Ginny's) with me. I am distracted with his conversation. He asks very non essential non related questions. How did I hear of this job opening? What shows do I watch on Fox channel? A disabled show, some news and an occasional movie. I unsnap the question section off its curved answer track. A device that is black and cumbersome. I keep trying to smooth out the curves so I can read the questions and answer them. I realize this is a very right brain work group and I am very left brain. I feel frustrated and aware I'd have to adjust to understanding what they are doing and do it their way. (297 words)

["Killer worms."] I am in a house. A young native American man and several white men come to the house with the intent to enter and be there. I am unsure if they mean me harm. He comes in and wants my company. So does the white man. It seems friendly enough. One gives me a loose cotton dress to wear so I will be more comfortable and more accessible to touch when we lie down on a couch together. It isn't particularly sexual in feeling. I look out a window to see if I have possible escape if I need it. I see a huge ice covered river on both sides of the house, the side and the back, practically right up to the door. It would be dangerous to go that way. Now there are frightening and dangerous animals in the house like swimming moles or something. They are coming toward us. We hit at them and run outside and dive into the river which is no longer snow and ice bound. We are in a small rowboat. These huge long tube worms come at us trying to eat us. We hit at them. It is ineffective. We are in serious danger. One comes right at the boat. And smashes us. We dive into the water to escape it's deadly mouth. Other huge ones slither by wearing a plastic raincoat kind of covering. I grasp at a stick that has a nail at the end and strike the head of the closest worm. It is hurt and retreats. I find a plastic knife and hand it to the man. It is no help. I then find a small paring knife and he uses that. We stab at them as they attack and swim quickly as we can for shore. We manage to escape alive and unhurt. (306 words)

I am frantically cooking. Cheese and meet tacos, omelets and some pastry treat. I also have a glass pot of very hot boiling water going. I see papers on the stove and try to move them from the burners. I push red buttons to see which burners can be turned down or off. The water is nearly over boiling. Finally we get the breakfast cooked and we rush outside with it, after choosing pretty glass plates to put it on so they will look delicious too. My "father's" new Subaru green van is out there and I decide to drive it, we get in and protect the drinks with a box so they won't spill on the way. I can't find the key. My "father" isn't home. I rush back in and ask Ellie where the key is. She finds it and we go back out. I have trouble opening the special double doors. I see two steering wheels, one a small one on the top right of the other regular one. I figure out how to turn it one and where the gas and brake pedals are. We lurch out the driveway. We are in a farm area. Suddenly I see there is no access to the highway., so I turn left toward E City on a dirt access road parallel to the highway, looking for some flat area I can get to the highway from. I see a woman has build a planked structure that might work but it looks flimsy. I ask her if she thinks it will hold our weight. She says sure. I gun across it and turn to get on the highway and see I'm blocked by parked cars. I keep driving until I finally find a way to the highway. Now I am speeding along, enjoying the power of this new vehicle. (347 words)

["Athletic lovers."] I am a high school girl on the basketball team. A high school boy is the best male basketball player and we are pretty equal in prowess. We enjoy the competition of playing well together on the team. There is also a love attraction. I play forward, and seem to be more in a volleyball stance at the non net area. We play hard and enjoy the speed and power. Then he insists I play catcher in a baseball game, another game he is good at. I put on the protective front chest protector and a mitt. I don't know this game as well. He helps me put on the protective gear. We are playing the game in the high school hall and we are at a t corner of two halls. I have to catch and pass a fast ball and hit a small child in the head. I feel terrible. I race over away from her so my next throw won't hurt her. I have to decide which way down the perpendicular hall I must throw. I feel inept in this game and resent the fact that he insists I do this, changing the enjoyment of our teamwork in the basketball game. Now a cheerleader girl comes over and flirts with him and he upset with me, asks her to the dance. I am very hurt. Sad. I accept a date with another jock, but it is the first man I love. Finally he comes to me and touches a deep bone bruise he had created by accidentally hitting me with the baseball in the game. He is remorseful and tenderly realizes he has hurt me. He asks my forgiveness and kisses me gently. We are back together again. (291 words)

["Bill Clinton and energy power grid problems."] I am on a sidewalk in a downtown city. I have a wonderful big black keyboard box with many complicated buttons. I have no idea how to play it but experiment and make some beginning strides toward simple melodies. I am teaching myself how to be more proficient on it. Somehow this box has something to do with electrical power in the city as well. I must drive down a highway to get to the ocean's edge and fix the power grid problem. I am picked up by Bill Clinton in a black car. He is on the same mission. We somehow get past a narrow gate across the road and reach land's end. A restaurant is there, we go in and see they are remodeling so that they will grow the fish in pools there outside the restaurant for the people to eat. I also see a large group of Asian workers in their slickers working the ocean and moving in lines as a group toward shore. Now Bill and I are back in the car backing up that curvy road back to the city. He decides he wants to make out and starts to lie on me. I grab his face and hold him back from a kiss and say. No way, guy. I don't care if you are powerful or could cause me problems, I don't want this. He is annoyed with me. I force my way out of the car to walk back to the city. I am a bit worried he will try and run me over. (262 words)

I try to read the script but the print is very small and the pictures, like yellow beaked Tuku birds are hard to see. I struggle trying to get the character. Then I say wait. I need my glasses. I put them on and continually come up with creative little scenes that are amusing and cute. I am getting better at the work and wonder why he is featuring me if I'm not going to be in the play.

["Weird roommates from the radio."] I am moving into a house. I enter and begin to look around at the rooms. Suddenly I find I have at least four male roomies that are military pilots. They had already moved in and have their things in drawers and so on. I try and talk to them to find out about how we are going to arrange things. They don't talk to me and ignore me. I am annoyed. Then one of them begins to talk about writing. I find the subject very interesting and begin to answer but he just continues talking, asking me questions and then not giving me a moment to answer. I get increasingly angry and annoyed. He talks about not lecturing and so on in the writing. Then he abruptly leaves, the rest of them going outside with him. I get up. I have a long outer coat on and look into a closet for a place to hang it. I try several times but it falls off the weird elaborate hanging devices. I decide a big hook on the door will work fine. I open the side door to the side yard to see where those roomies went. I see a white cat like creature with a human head. I see the roomies are in the house next door. They continue to ignore me. I decide to walk for a bit outside to help me get over my anger. I walk down the sidewalk past the house the roomies are in, right next door. I see the inside of the house is gutted and a terrible mess. I then see them and their friends in the side yard again. I walk over to them and try to talk to their women friends. They are uppity and silent. I return to the house. I decide to evict them. I go to each one as they wander around the house an invisible eviction letter. They reach out and take it. Finally they all leave and I start examining what rooms I have. I open one door and find an empty narrow small room with a door at the other end. I walk in and see dotted lines on one wall indicating woven drawers, very large ones in the wall. I pull one open and see it could be used as a youth bed. It has a blanket in it. I see there is one snort drawer and two big ones in a row. That's good. Then I see there is now a bathtub on that wall. Now I'm thinking these drawers could be great storage drawers for towels and so on. Much more space and storage than my own house (40th Ave). I then turn and see a wall mounted shower hand held device and am very happy to see this. There is no toilet or sink those are in the next room. I am pleased with this arrangement. A roll in accessible shower room with a tub for the others, such as guests. I then go to the bathroom which has the toilet and sink. This house is changing into a nice place to live. (523 words)

["Quick marriages."] I am teaching in an elementary school. The principal is going to be married to a woman. I am going to be married to another man. But for no apparent reason, we decide we like each others man better and swap. We marry on the instant the last day of school. He and I are walking no from the school building to meet a cousin Viola. She comes up and I introduce my husband explaining the swap. She is very surprised. I also explain my daughter suddenly got married. There are at least three of us couples that just instantly married someone we hardly knew. My man gently supports me to a small platform with an organ on it. It is his organ. But as I play the key, I hear it is a piano and see another platform with an organ on it. That is the real one my husband owns. My cousin disapproves. I feel fine about it. Kind of new and interesting. (165 words)

["Howard returns and it is pleasant."] I live in a house. I wake up to discover Howard is there. He has brought me many gifts. On a table are a selection of a dog's toy collection with mechanical cute toys. One has a metal bumble bee that buzzes around a house. I lie on the couch. I am confused because I can't remember where Howard had been or why he is here. I try to remember if he's been around and I didn't notice or he'd been on a long trip. I do know it has been years since I've seen him. I feel a twinge of guilt that he has been without sex all that time, from me. He lies down on the couch with me. It is gentle and pleasant. I feel a twinge of concern he will want to have sex, but he is friendly and cuddly. I look at his face and see he is more handsome and his hair is prettier than I remember him before. He gets up and brings me more gifts. Cute stuffed animals on a house, with the individual names of each of my daughters and me on each spangly stuffed animal. It is cute. I try and remember where his bedroom used to be. I finally remember it is up stairs, where I can't get to at the end of the hall. I don't know if I want him to stay or not, but I feel good about seeing him again. (245 words)

["Uncle Lionel an actor."] I am in an auditorium where my Uncle Lionel, who I call Grandfather has joined some performance group that teaches about logging and sawing skills. He is showing off his work to me. His troupe all gather around me and are friendly. One man is attracted to me. I am now sitting in an overstuffed chair. The troupe is focusing their show toward me. One man is on my left with a saw devise on the left arm of the chair demonstrating it. Another man is behind me demonstrating something else. I see on the stage area my Uncle a part of an acrobatic piece where they saw in half huge logs of paper rolls and then tumble down into a trampoline safety net. Then more troupers come out, one woman like Bonnie (with stroke) playing the fiddle. Now two dogs come up to me, each carrying candy or a small toy in their mouths for me to have. One is a pink poodle and very clever, returning a small tootsie roll candy back to a small platform around its neck. Someone hands me a kitten. I cuddle it and say oh no. I can't accept another cat. You need to take it away quickly before I can't return it, because I will like it too much. The troupe says "UH-OH" like they made a mistake and take the kitty back. I'm already rethinking the decision. Now I am getting involved in the acting. They move an actor to another room and I follow him. The troupe joins us and I am given a small green animal mask to hold and I am to go back to the audience and say the name of this character. I hear Chris Dilloncake. They frown and repeat the name. I can't seem to understand the last name correctly. It ends up sounding like MobCake. (311 words)

A young teen woman and me (a young teen woman) are on the run from a policeman who is after us. He is ruthless and out to get us. I try and protect my friend but the policeman (plain clothes man) grabs her and drags her with him. He is interrogating her, threatening her, yelling at her. She yells out "Officer Dunn" a kind of officer at a lower level. He hears her and races up to where she is to help protect her. He races right up to the bad cop, in his face, yelling let her go. The bad cop shoves him aside. He had forced her and me to give samples of our blood. We each have our sample in vials in our hands. He demands hers. She tries to fight him off. She manages to throw her vial so he can't get it. She runs toward Officer Dunn. The bad cop comes after me, livid with hate and rage. I run into a small lab room and out again. I yell I threw it away. He sneers and goes into the lab room and picks up a vial. He says if you say you threw it away, then you didn't and this is it. He tips up his head and drinks it down fast. I scream No, No. It was some kind of acid poison. He convulses out of the chair onto the floor screaming in his horror and the pain. Oh, God, he screams. He is seated now cross legged in an upright fetal ball position. He says in pain I mustn't be so loud. I scream Oh God Oh God. As loud as I can. He dies quickly. I wake up hearing both our screams echoing loudly in my mind. Horror. Nightmare. I felt shocked. (301 words)

["Kalua."] I am late getting to school. Enter a classroom where a man and a woman Perry and ? are lying on the floor chatting. We have a small pass along verbal exercises. I take part in them. I am the last one and make a sentence about Perry and ?. Now I am looking for a bathroom. I need to pee. On my way through the rooms, I pick up a small half full/empty glass coffee with Kalua in it. I ask a woman's permission to serve it to a group of men in a meeting room. As they are talking, I realize it is the Repertoire Theatre talking about doing one act plays. I want to talk with them about doing my plays. I ask the first man permission to pour him a small amount. I say I do mean small. I don't have much and hope it will go all around. He barely nods. I say the city gave permission and this is a restaurant so it must be OK. I go to each one and barely have enough to go around. For the last two the thickness is nearly solid. I put too much on one saucer and need to cut it to even it out. (209 words)

["Reindeer ride."] I am at a large family gathering. Long tables in long rows. Many of them. Dinner is over and I walk between the tables collecting small souvenir glasses of various shapes. Small square, short round ones, stemmed small goblets. Dora is there. She had brought the glasses as little gifts. Maybe its Xmas. I decide I want to drive a small sled with one reindeer. They tuck me in under warm blankets and I start slowly, gain confidence. I go around the outside of the tables in a large square. By the 3rd corner I am going very fast and have improved my driving is now quite good. I feel good. (111 words)

["Beautiful dream pictures."] I am in a house. Family is visiting, like a reunion. Aunt Charlotte, Dwight and Jake and others. A Chinese family is there. A husband and wife, and their two children, a girl and a boy. I am talking to Dwight and Jake as we sit around a round table. Dwight faces me across the table and Jake sits on my right. We are talking about my mortgage. I tell them I hope to sell the houses in a few years and buy another one, build up rentals. It will be my retirement money, I say. The Chinese woman keeps coming over to show me toys and clothes she bought for her children. She unfolds a cardboard cutout of a dress for the girl. She will have time to grow into it as it is taller than she is. The boy pops by and shows me some face painting mask on his face. I like the colors and compliment him on the look, although it is half rubbed off and smudged now. The Chinese man now sits on my right where Jake was (the brothers are gone now) The children flit in and out showing me what the mother got them. I keep getting interrupted by their energy. They want to share and then pull away and don't want to share. They bring me some pictorial images of their dreams. At first, they look like paintings on newsprint paper with narrative written like on a scroll. I notice the girls clouds with the structure of the world globe map, countries outlined, is very similar to the father's picture. He says they did their dream pictures at the same time so I assume she is using his dream images. I tell the man I am a professional DreamWorker, being a counselor. He is hesitant to show me his dream, but after I say that, he is now eager to share. They are now like 3-d cutout boxes, like a pop up in a book or greeting card. With an additional pop up box added with a house and landscape. I compliment him on the beauty of his presentation of the dream. I say usually people put dreams in a narrative form. I have long been interested in creating a visual pictorial form of sharing the dream. I am excited with his 3-d cut out images. (394 words)

["Speech contest."] I am with a few people in a room. Someone says we should give our speeches now. I am not prepared yet. I'd been making notes but I hadn't practiced it yet. I say ok and go to the front of the room and improvise as best I can. I am talking about four toys I hold in my hand. A thin green rubber figure, a squarish pink thing, and two others. As I give the speech, I realize this is merely a rehearsal and wish it were the real contest because I'm doing OK and don't want to have to do it again. I finish and then it is time for the contest in the other room. I go there and sit quickly down on a weird single bed with a rubbery covering. It bounces another speaker around suddenly. The judges (several women) have spiked hair do's. I remember I had just washed my hair and hurriedly brush it to get the tangles out. Now I am back in the other room looking for the judges grade on my speech. I look through a pile of papers seeing numbers and dates and letter grades. The pile goes from A'' to B'' to C''. I don'' see mine. I keep searching for it. I hope I at least got a B. (221 words)

I am walking from the street to my apartment through the yard. A man with thick dark hair in a business suit, good looking and then stands there waiting for me. I see it is "Bill Domhoff." I greet him, I am pleasantly surprised to see him. He says I'm here in town to see the Red Bridge opening ceremony. I say you are here in E City? He says yes. I say well, come on in. I see he is standing by a white budding rosebush which is near the wall of the building. He smiles and we begin to walk toward the door. I somehow get a large prickly sticker caught in my left big toe. It hurts. I say I can't reach it to pull it out. I hop down a weird staircase where the wood rails are sort of like gymnastic beams, in dark wood. One step is very long and deep so I must hang on to it with my arms around it and dangle as I go hand over hand down. I make it to the entry door and we go in. I see my father, a very old dottering man with a very serious deaf hearing problem. I ask him to help take the sticker out of my toe. Bill waves his hand in front of my father's face to see if he's alive. My father didn't hear or see us and mumbles and walks away. I ask Bill to help me. I feel embarrassed to ask him to touch my possibly stinky toes. With Bill is a tall good looking man named Dustin Hoffman only he looks like Clint Eastwood. He ends up looking like Clint. Starts out short and lots of dark hair. When I ask Bill to help me with my toe, I ask anyone in the room generally if they'll help. Too embarrassed to ask directly. I am trilled that Dustin is there and hope I can work the fact that I am a scriptwriter into the conversation. I am very hopeful I will be discovered by him and become rich and famous. I'm also glad Bill is there and ask him what he'd like to do while in E City. I'd be happy to show him around. Now Dustin Hoffman is a little upset. An important award he has is in some jeopardy of being broken. We go to another room. A man is pinned and caught on a rope up on the wall and the rope is attached to the award/art piece. A cello with climbing ivy like plants artistically growing up out of the top of the cello. If Dustin clips the rope the award will fall and be ruined. He is upset. I say, I can help you. I am confident and cheerful. I am still hopping a bit because the sticker is still in my toe. They are both worried that I will damage the cello art piece. I pull on the rope and up goes the cello and down comes the man with in my reach. It is now Bill. I must pull his head toward my shoulder to reach the pin holding him on the rope. We are chatting in a friendly manner. I am listing things I have. I mention negligee. He murmurs provocatively I'll bet you don't have them anymore (joking me about my long time without sex.) and I smile provocatively and murmur "Oh yes, I do still have them." We smile at each other flirting. I get him unpinned and released. Now I must pull the original man down to me. He's an old silly professor that now looks like a cute chimp. I hold the chimp in my arms and unhook him from the rope. Dustin/Clint is very happy to have his award back unharmed. I try to read the small engraved plaque with it to see what he got the award for. I can't read it (small print), but I guess he did some humanitarian thing he's being thanked for. (674 words)

I've just moved into an apartment. A weird crazy man walks in. He grabs a male guest and ties him up and tortures him. I am in the kitchen. Bonnie and another woman are there. I feel fear. I feel guilty for not doing anything to help the man, but if we try and help him, we might get tortured. I try and clean up the kitchen, washing some dishes. Something catches fire on a burner. I try and put out the fire. I see a cell phone and try to find the emergency number to reach the police. I remember 911 and dial it. A woman receptionist answers from some company. I am very surprised. It isn't 911. I whisper so the crazy man won't hear me, although he comes into the kitchen and glares at me suspiciously. I try and tell her the address, I can't remember it because I just moved in. I think the street is Durban Court and the apartment number is 58. I feel very inadequate. I tell her about the man and ask her about the man and ask her to call for help for me. She says no. I am shocked. I hang up and go to the open doorway of the kitchen. I see the man has put objects like matches and pens between the eyeballs and the lower lids. The trapped man doesn't dare move. I feel badly for him. I go back into the kitchen and try to look up the number for 911. I can't find it. Suddenly I see the trapped man is released and in the kitchen behind the stove. He asks me what were we all doing while he was being tortured. I feel guilty and quickly explain I had been trying to call for help. Did he know the number for 911? Or the address? I can't remember the address. Someone knocks on the front door. The crazy man goes to the door and opens it. A man thinks this is his apartment. I take this moment while the crazy man is distracted and go out into the hall and look up above the door for the apartment number. 61. At least I know that now. I hope I hadn't moved into the wrong apartment. Then I see the crazy man is also out in the hall. I hesitate, afraid and then I go in and shut the door locking it. Two doors. The trapped man is worried. If we try and lock him out he'll get angry and want revenge. I am worried about that too but I do it anyway. I lean against the door. The lock seems weak. I think of moving a heavy bookcase up against the door. The crazy man returns and pounds on the door. The door is about to break. Then the crazy man oozes through under the door jam. He is now a "small person." I grab him by the throat and try to strangle him while I hold him up. I go out to the hall and throw him in the elevator. I yell at him not to come back! (525 words)

I am in a house. My brother Dwight is visiting. He brought my parents. They are old, sick and frail. I'm not feeling so strong myself. Dwight decides to leave. I realize he's leaving my parents there and I'll have to take care of them. I call after him. No. This isn't fair. I tell Dwight I have to work at my job. I can't be here all the time. He leaves. My mother needs to use the bathroom. My father decides to go downstairs to nap. I show my mother the upstairs bathroom. It is short like a vanity under the sink. I tell her it will be very uncomfortable for her. I open the vanity door. It is impossible for anyone to use that bathroom. I give up and am tired so I go downstairs leaving my mother alone, lying on a couch. I go down a long hall remembering my bedroom is at the end and to the left. It's been years since I've seen this bedroom. I see the bathroom door on the right. I go into my bedroom. (Old house, like recurring many roomed old houses in other dreams.) Charla comes in. I ask her to help me make my bed. She agrees. Then I see a worm on the folded bedspread (white) at the foot of the bed. I ask her to remove the worm because I don't want to touch it. She turns her back on me and says no. I get furious. I scream at her. Do you want to fight? I'll lose control, is that what you want? I am daring her to not be helpful so I can hit her and scream at her. She ignores me. (287 words)

["Dreams."] I am at a person's house. We are having a meeting of the dream group, a group of women. We are going to decide on what structures we will agree on for when we do dreamwork. We convene and a medical doctor is here especially to help us work out our structure. I welcome him. Then I read from a typed list of suggestions made so far. A student from a University makes one suggestion. Howard has another. It is about things coming from the same part of the brain and you must focus on that area. I have a question about whether or not the title or the date should be written first. A long fancy letter from a group called Lovely(Thing? Thoughts? moments?) from Arizona is talking about what they do as a group. Now we are preparing for the potluck meeting. The room is small and square and up one half level. I put some kind of food on the table. Someone knocks on the door. I walk down to the large living room and across it to the door. I let in a women. I walk back toward the dream room. Another knock. This repeats a number of times as couples, well dressed and women come in with lots of food. I realize there will not be enough room for everyone in the small room, so I contemplate moving it into the living room. The owner of the house is somewhere in the kitchen. The phone rings. I say hello but the woman at the other end can't hear me. She is confused. Apparently she was trying to call The Emporium. I keep trying to speak to her. Later another woman asks me if the higher level rooms are accessible. I say no, they aren't. I am not real happy with all these couples. (I am reminded of the my discussion circle group.) (317 words)

["Sharon's mother."] I am outside a house. Preparing for something. We'd been making decorations and signs and so on for some meeting. I need a little break from all the noise and people. I pace back and forth in the drive way. There is a pack of nuts. I want to eat them all. But I only eat some, so I don't mess with my diet. I realize Sharon's mother is coming to help with the preparations. For some reason, I don't want to meet with her, but I must. So I put the nuts down in the garage and walk out to the driveway to meet her. She is going to create a thing that will go on the roof of the house. It will incorporate a boy who created a special dance step. (133 words)

["The river rises."] I live in a tiny one room cabin on a high rocky bank of a river out in the expansive plains. Rocky and rough terrain like around M City. Fluffy is playing. I see her down in the now empty river bed. I go down there and stand in the dry river bed. Fluffy is sunning herself and playing. I look up river to the bend. I see white water coming around the corner. I vaguely remember hearing they were temporarily stopping the river flow at the dam for maintenance. They must have released it. I see what looks like kids on black inner tubes riding the wave. I turn and pick up Fluffy and run back up to the cabin. I think about getting in the van and driving fast away. But I decide the river probably won't get up so high it will flood the cabin. The river rushes down the bed and rises quickly. It is at the foundation of the cabin. I think maybe I made a mistake and now its too late. I will be trapped in the cabin. And can't drive away on the flooded plains. I look again and the river has evened out. I will be safe. Later, I drive into the country store. A man comes up to me. An acquaintance of me and my husband. He is attracted to me and wants me. I excitedly tell him about the close encounter with the river. He comes up very close and grabs my arms. He wants to make love. I try to struggle out of his embrace. He is very insistent. I tell him if he doesn't release me right now I will scream rape. He hesitates and then releases me. I drive back to the cabin. (296 words)

["I don't belong here."] Anastasia invites me to a real estate social evening. 3 women. Ann, Anastasia and a 3rd in a long . Smoozing. Some business dresses, some fancy clothes. It's like we are at an art gallery room. I see a man I used to act in a play with him. I remember a touching moment we had at some other gathering like this. He had a series of miniature oil paintings his father had painted of a piece of property he loved. Vibrant Van Gogh like paintings. Black crows flying up off a straw field, a whirlwind of straw rising to the sky. The color red. Other paintings blues and purples is sky and sunset. Cobalt blue. I find some paintings that remind me of that time. I see Perry sitting alone by a wall. I walk to him and share these paintings with him. It is tender and sweet and sad. He's a bit plump and older now. Anastasia comes over and I say I'm here because she insisted I be there. Perry says you look like you belong here (dressed up, smoozing). I say sadly I don't belong here. The only part that means anything to me is your paintings and us talking. Perry looks sad and goes away. I say to Anastasia I get so hungry for someone like Perry. Oh, I know he's probably an alcoholic and not right for me. But I so want that connection. Anastasia gently touches my arm and says I know. But I love you. I say I know. Friends. But I want THAT kind of love. We walk out the room into the moonlight where the silvery dresses of the women and their clients waft around. Anastasia says I know one room where you can have your feelings. We go to a museum room where beautiful cobalt blue and other colors of flat artistic bowls are displayed. People, sad lonely people, make ritualistic circular motions around the edges of these bowls. One woman croons once I made a metal one thin out. I see 2 older men looking at photos of his father's paintings. The father had died the last year. They mourn for him. I with wild sadness circle and circle the bowl with my dancing hands. (377 words)

I am on an expedition to retrieve case notes from my Mexico trip. It is time to write the book based on my research. I ask several Mexican men to help me carry the piles of notes and papers through the woods to the right place. One leaves early another later. I realize I may have put my notes in jeopardy by not keeping them together and supervised. I follow the trail. I can't carry them all myself. I tried. But now I am on a very tall mountain. The owner of the company, a man is showing me what it is like to work in the high altitudes. With so little oxygen, it is dangerous work. I follow him down paths. I see the sheer rock cliff faces we are working on. In order to sleep, you have to strap yourself into a device and be sprayed with sleeping drugs. Then you wake up and continue. The food is odd. A dandelion fluff like thing you nibble on. It is cold and difficult to work. We are mining. Now the man says you find the right way to get to the mine. He'd led me once. I have a very hard time remembering the right paths. Finally, I see I took a wrong path, but I got there anyway. So I learned that all paths lead to the mine. Other workers are there. We are isolated up there. so we are friends to each other. A man feels sad because his love is far away. A woman worker empathizes with him. They talk it over. Another woman worker is going to take a bit of time off and have fun exploring the steep difficult terrain. I feel my irregular heart beat and realize this is taking a huge toll on me physically. I wonder if I will survive it. The mines are important. (314 words)

I have apparently bought a huge very nice house with a large entry way and a banquet sized dining room kitchen. A heated swim pool in the back yard. Lydia and her children (high school age) are visiting me. I mop the entry way. I have to walk what looks like a mile to the other end of the house it is so big. I wonder why I chose to have such a large house at this age of my life with the kids growing up and moving out. I like the house but the work keeping it up is a lot. I go out and swim in the pool. I am under water and floating toward the surface. I then see a man watching me from an upstairs window in the neighbors house. He's living there for the summer, writing a novel. He comes over because I invited him to have ice cream with me and talk writing. I tell him I am writing a novel too. (168 words)

["Eastern Indian sexual rituals."] I am watching as the men of eastern India hand a small metal square to a woman they are in relationship with. She sits on it so that the vagina lips touch the metal and then she is consumed by sexual passion and they make love. I watch as one couple after another do this. Some of the women have figured out how to have their own metal square and chose the man they want. I see Bootsie has been chosen by another cat. She sits in a pretty ceramic bowl and he has his bowl right next to her. He is kind to her. I am glad for her. I am also concerned because a black cat who is not kind is near by and if the kind cat leaves it will take over. A dark skinned black curly haired tall man wants a beautiful daughter of the house and tries to catch her with his square. I feel very sexually excited. (163 words)

["Bette Midler retires."] I see Bette Midler walking across a lawn talking with people. I understand she is retiring now. I sit in a car, in the passenger side. Bette comes over, curious and gets in the driver's side. Perhaps I had signaled her to come over. She waits to see what I have to say. I tell her I loved her song "The Rose" the best. She says her too. I say my friend Lucy who has a beautiful singing voice sang it and I would harmonize with her. I would cry every time I sang it. I ask her if she will miss performing and singing. I'll bet she would. She smiles and I say quickly, but then maybe you just want to sit by the swim pool eating watermelon. She smiles and agrees that's all she wants to do now. It would give her great pleasure. (146 words)

["Oops. I forgot my classes."] I suddenly become aware that I have missed University classes for two weeks now and am very far behind. I could very easily flunk. I have a paper due on Monday and haven't a clue what to write about. I think about writing just that. Then I realize I could drop the classes. I don't have to be tasking classes any more. It is a relief. It might be too late to drop them without a grade drop, but I don't care. I don't want to be taking these classes any more. (92 words)

I am excited about sharing my results from my dream program. I have lots of numbers. I call a man over to where I am working. I tell him I want to show him my results. He's an official. Then I get the attention of a woman, well known in dreams, who becomes curious about all my numbers. I am trying to explain my dream program to her. There is a man near. I know we like each other but I don't know why. A mysterious feeling of knowing him. Then I see a group of men in brown security guard uniforms, all wearing masks of famous people. They sit like they were on a plane or train. I begin to feel fear. Something awful is happening and I am afraid. I keep forgetting things. The woman runs. I say to the man, are we moving? Are we moving? It feels like we are on some vehicle. Then the woman runs out screaming hysterically "Why would they want to kill me?" over and over. I wake up, feeling fear. Night terror? or Nightmare? (183 words)
Barb Sanders #2:#4053 (02/16/01)

I must remember to write down what's happening. I call that official man out of his office to look over the weird things that happened over my dream program. He looks like he's in a trance. The man I am attracted to is still there. We don't remember why we met or how, just that we love each other. A pretty woman is there. Everyone else is gone. I look with fear down a flight of stairs. "They" are down there. We have to protect ourselves from the aliens. The mayor and several other people stand around in a trance. I and the man's mother move into a room. She lost lots of weight and her clothes are huge, nearly falling off her. We gasp. Proof. Time has passed, but not normally. I notice with irony even under these circumstances I don't lose weight. Now these few other people are coming back in with rags on. That's all that's left. Decaying rotting rags. The pretty woman still looks pretty even though her clothes are mismatched. I think that is ironic as well. We must remember to gather and store water. To survive. A man points to a circular patterned woven basket mat in a front window of a house. Bees. He says in fear. They are like bees. We begin to run to find a place to hide. Little bees appear near us and try to sting us. We swat at them. We run into a room with a bathroom and try to lock the doors. They won't lock no matter how hard I try. I say get some pots. I turn on the faucet for water and plug the sink. The pretty woman brings small paper cups "because they are prettier." She said. Even she realizes this is illogical and non survival like. I try and fill the sink but the water escapes down the drain. I am afraid and continue to try and lock the doors. Holes appear. They are coming. I wake up. Fear like monsters are under the bed. Nightmare. (344 words)

I decide to find out where the male director lives. I see the back end of my van as I drive down a street looking for him, only he is now a she. Lisa, not Perry. She sees me drive by. I see me turn left, pretending I am lost. Now me the observer sees a woman in a wheelchair who says she leaned into the experience too much and fell over backwards and hurt herself. Now I see a pretty woman from last dream walking down a sidewalk perpendicular from the wheelchair woman. Now I am running with her and we are at exactly the same place as the end of the last dream. We race into the bathroom and try to lock the doors. This time the doors lock good. I realize the alien is in the pretty woman and say to it, show yourself. Another irony. I had just locked myself IN with the alien. The pretty woman falls back on the toilet unconscious, like the alien will come out of her. I try to see the alien. Nothing is there. The doors are secured. I feel OK. I wake up. (194 words)

I am at a store, garage area. I'm trying to convince an Asian woman to back my play. She keeps popping in and zipping off. She won't sit still and hear my proposition. She gets on a motorcycle like contraption and goes down the street with a boy (9 or 20) on her lap. She helps this guy who owns the store, garage to do business better. She waves her foot which is oddly shaped a bit like a hand. I see she holds her right arm like the hand is missing. She's laughing and playing as she goes on around the corner. I sit there disappointed. I wanted her to back my play. Then the older man owner, comes by and we talk. I share my disappointment with him. He says what the hell, he'll help. All I need is $100,000. As I am thinking I haven't got $100,000. He's asking if I want the 2PM and 9PM dinner breaks catered. I nod yes, I need to find Sparky's (The Asian Woman)'s phone number she gave me. The man and I walk down a road. We are attracted to each other and chatting. I see my plaid blanket on the side of the road with other blankets. I say who put my blanket out here. I am teasing him because he did, made a bed there last night and its really his blanket anyway. Then we get to my room. Lots of books on shelves like a store front only its my bedroom. The man is curious to see my room. I suddenly remember I left the phone number up at his store. I say I'll run up and get it. I run part way back up the road and then fall off the road on the right side. It's like a room with a wall. I get back up, embarrassed. 2 older men are there, the owner and some other nice man. Now there's a slider door across the road. I open the door. A young man jokes about needing to pee. I shut the door, remembering I have the phone number in my room. I go back to my room passing a grandmotherly plump woman seated by Charla saying "She's grown so much since I've seen her. I agree. Then the owner asks me a question and I sigh saying I don't have $100,000. It's a relief to be honest and say that. He asks how much I have. I say $10,000. He says OK. We'll do it. (421 words)

I see Sparky and ask her to stay for a few minutes and hear the dream I had about her. As I describe how she was willing to back my play in the dream, I realize its like asking her to back me now. She smiles and says like Celeste so name the term you want to be in another play. I say OK. That will be fun. It will be nice to be in the Center for another performance. I ask her to list the future productions coming up. I also ask her if I can submit a play to her for consideration. She agrees I can submit it. Then she offers me a couple of vegetarian like hamburgers with some purple like cabbage like veggie on the side. There are four varieties of this slightly hot and spicy veggie. I taste it and it is very delicious. I eat it all. I thank her for the food. Then there is an actor, Richard Gere who visits. (168 words)
Barb Sanders #2:#4057 (02/17/01)

Now the actor Richard Gere behaves like Jim Carrey. Making outrageous jokes. He is funny and annoying at the same time. Cute but pushy. He wants to watch a video with me. He chooses one called "The Thing" I say oh no. Is this that really scary one? We start watching. It's a horror story, but I realize I'd seen it before. A woman with arthritis. No so scary after all, just an OK story. I get bored and go upstairs. I see Ellie lying in a child'' bed trying to sleep. As I am walking up the stairs, I see a man and woman getting ready to be married. They wear fancy clothes that are red silk and silver sequins. Matching shoes. She can't get her shoes to fit right and stay on. He ridicules her as they bicker up the stairs. I point out a steep hill that represents Ginny and Ernie's relationship. A strong together relationship. Now I am back in the room with Richard Gere and Ellie and a small child, a girl, and Ginny. I am helping the girl do some task. Richard keeps interrupting with Jim Carrey tricks. I say jokingly who let this guy in anyway. I realize it was me that invited him in. A friend of Sparkey's. (216 words)

["Spider woman ritual."] I apparently have a Mexican father named Jamisma and a Native American mother. I am accused to stealing a special bridal dress of a native American woman. I say I am innocent. They are very angry at me. Now my "father" shows me a large silver broach filigree work and a center turquoise stone. Caught under that broach is a huge spider. My "father" is afraid to touch it or let it crawl on him. I am too. I watch it closely when it moves, afraid it will come at me. After a long time doing that, my "father" then allows it to crawl on his shoulder. He says the spider is mostly dead now. Maybe completely dead. He asks me where we should put it. I say put it in the garbage can. If it is alive, it can feed on the food there and survive. He agrees, He thinks of piercing it's center colored spot on the belly to put it out of its misery. But if it has a chance to live, he agrees to let it try. He takes it out. I then go into a room. The ritual ceremony is about to begin. My "mother" begins it. She moves around me, talking. There is some large cannon shaped object that my "father" positions and fires off. A lot of stuff floats down from the shot. It is positioned several times and fired. I am concerned the spider will return. Now the angry Native American girl glares at me and demands I return the bridal dress for her ceremony. I look at her and say empathetically "I understand." But I can't return it. I didn't take it. Apparently there was some accident that happened to it, and that may have happened because of me. But the girl wants retribution. (303 words)

I am a beautiful fold singer singing for a very colorful crowd of 90 people all crowded, standing around me. At first they look like colorful cloth objects. Then I see they are people. I have dark slightly curly long hair. I play a mandolin. My playing is intricate and beautiful. I manage to get unusual melodic complex sounds out of this simple folk instrument. The audience loves me. I sing song after song. I see the scene now from behind me. I see a cloth spread out with cassette tapes of my music to sell and food and a big glass bowl of water for the audience. Now a tall good looking man comes behind me and opens a hinged window, like a hatch back car window. This changes the dynamics of the sound and makes it a bit harder to sing. I keep on, compensating for the change. He is interested in me. I am attracted to him. I say I'll sing two more songs. Lots of applause. I sing one of my "favorite" tunes. "Gold Rings." It's about a man offering a gold ring and relationship and I am interested, but then I am glad I refused the gold ring because then I'm free of doing the dishes and helping him and losing my music and freedom. Now the concert is over. A young woman comes up to talk. She wears a large plastic shopping bag over her head. She has a question. Can I tell her how to sing a particular note? I ask her to take off the bag so when we talk I can see her eyes. She shyly takes it off slowly. She mentions a boyfriend. I say, it is possible to have both your music and a boyfriend but you have to decide which one is priority. My music comes first, I say this so the attractive man can hear. He seems to understand. He waits for the woman to go and we walk off together pleasantly getting acquainted. (337 words)

["I can walk now."] I am in a wheelchair at perhaps a University. Friendly people and I are going from one building to another. Lots of stairs everywhere and no ramps. I drive my wheelchair up a short flight of cement stairs. I make it, quite surprised that I did. And pleased. I then see the left wheel is frayed and damaged, coming apart. I look down a long flight of stairs. Too long to drive the chair down. I see another back flight of stairs made of wood and flatter longer steps, more gradual. I decide the chair won't work anymore and decide I will attempt to sit on my butt and scoot down step by step. A woman stands at my left and I stand out of the chair and balance, leaning on her arm for support. Then I take a step and successfully manage the first step. I try a second step and one by one I successfully walk down the full flight of stairs. I am ecstatic. I can walk now. A male professor, friendly is in the background somewhere. (180 words)

Then a group of able bodied dancers join me. We do this choreographed number involving tap dancing. I have a board where my foot pedals were and I tap with them.

["Jake, Lydia and me cleaning up."] Jake, Lydia and Me are living in a house together. I think it used to be my parents house, although I've never seen it before. There are two kitchen areas. I am in the room that is like a rec room, only there is a stove. I see it has a gas burner and it is on. The flame shoots high up and I worry that it will catch something on fire. I turn it off. It goes out and then pops back on. It is apparently the pilot light. One spark singes an eyebrow hair I got too close. I open the oven door and see it is on too. There are hamburger patties cooking and a chocolate cake with chocolate and green icing trim. I get a spatula and take them out a piece at a time. I suggest Jake eat some now. I then try and clean up the top of the stove. Lydia is in the kitchen doing dishes. Now we walk down a hall. I point to the floors of the various rooms where carpet had been ripped up and blotches of an ugly green carpet residue is all over the floor in patches. We go into an almost empty room, like a living room. A TV and a recliner chair is there. The TV is at one long end and the chair is clear at another. I suggest me move the chair closer to the TV. I then see it is plugged in and ask Lydia if there is another outlet in the room. We see one. I have to use an adapter plug, but we set it up. I sit in the chair and decide to color for awhile. I pull out a few crayons and chalks and a poster picture. It is a fuzzy dragon creature. I start with giving it pink hair. I want it to be purple on the body. As I color, I look again and it is a curvaceous woman. I am coloring her skin green. I have a yellow chalk I pick up accidentally and color for awhile. Then a large giant stuffed monster kind of creature is in the room. He and all his stuff is at the far end. He doesn't want us there coloring. I say well, if we promise not to come near your side of the room and not color anything of yours is it ok if we stay? He says yes. Now the picture is a man in an outdoor cooking apron. I continue coloring. (424 words)

["Gardens in the hall."] I am walking down a long hall in an apartment building. The hall area in front of every apartment door is decorated like an indoor garden, each one uniquely different. I see the pretty waterfalls and hanging plants. And statuary. They are very lovely. The apartment I am being shown is at the very end of the hall. I go in and it looks very nice, a red brocade couch. I need to go talk to the landlord and make arrangements. The man showing me the apartment gives me a special outfit I must wear for this interview. It is a formal pink gown with a ruffly stole that goes around my face and shoulders, up to my eyes. We go up to the top floor and I go to the door. I see odd letters that I think are dutch words but they look more Arabic or Chinese. This is the list of roommates that live in this apartment. I timidly knock on the wall near the door. Then I knock louder on the door. I wait. (178 words)

["Nice older couple and betrayal."] I am at a women's workshop. We are all sitting on the floor. I see a nice older couple who walk around together, arm in arm. They seem to be kind to each other and love each other. Susie is the lecturer or rather facilitator. As I am watching, the man suddenly says to the woman, "Maybe I'll just rape you." I do a double take I am so surprised. She almost doesn't hear it. The whole group goes silent in shock. The woman withdraws her arm and steps back. The man then walks away from her in obvious pursuit of a young pretty woman. He now wears a long black robe with stars and moons on it, like a wizard robe. He is seated with women around him like a harem. The old woman is distraught. I say to her, hold my hand. I will support you. She takes my hand and begins to walk like pacing in a circle around and around dragging me along. I have a hard time keeping up. She then lunges to the man throwing herself prostrate on the ground in front of him. Clutching his legs. We are all shocked and disapproving. She begs him to let her stay with him. (208 words)

["Magic moment in magic apartment."] I am a 30ish woman with a son. I meet this good looking loving fun kind man. We are outside walking around. The sense of humor, the camaraderie is intense. I like him and he me immediately. It is special and wonderful. He's walking me home. I want him to see my apartment. I open the door. It looks like a reception area of an office. A male secretary is there. I say good afternoon, walk through the small room to a door behind his desk. I open it and we enter a huge cavernous room where wonderful large wood carvings adorn the high cave like walls. A young priest is there and we talk. We are old friends. The man I like/love is good with my son. He's wearing jeans and a sweatshirt. He is interested in everything about me, including my magic like apartment. I say you have to see this . I push open a slim corner cupboard door. This is very important says my son. I push a lazy susan shelf and it goes around showing boxes and a china tea set. A couple of cups rattle as I push it around to show him. I have a tea set I say whimsically. There had been some jealousy between he and the priest. The priest is an old friend of mine. I turn and reach out my arms to the man. We embrace lovingly. It feels so right, so wonderful. The priest is disappointed and leaves. As we cling to each other, the man says in a love choked voice, I think I'll wear a white jacket. My son says "Whoa!" I freeze and pull back slowly. He is confused and says what? My son shakes his head sadly. I want to marry you, he says. I pull back further, very sad. I love him. I love being with him but marriage is impossible. He tries to back track. It's OK. No man, but the moment is gone. It will be over and I feel deeply sad. It had been so special and loving. (348 words)

["Demasking loving tom."] A man in his mid 30's maybe is dressed in a fancy suit sort of like a tux. He wears an odd smooth mask that covers his face like the blue men of IBM commercial or like Jim Carrey in The Mask, a movie. He and I begin to come closer to make love. We lie down on a bed and we kiss sensuously. It feels wonderful. The mask disappears. I begin to take off his clothes. I am sexually excited. I am on top. It is a tender and erotic experience. I sit up and he unbuttons my white shirt. We are naked and begin the process of guiding his penis in. It feels wonderful. (116 words)

["Visiting mom."] I am outside at what is supposedly my parents' house. But I've never seen it before. I am packing to go back home. I am going through some things on a bench. My mother comes out and says something negative. I respond with a statement that indicated she made a mistake about what she was saying about me. I did it with some calmness. My mother goes back in the house. I pick up some books. I'd left there at the last visit. My baby photo album with writing in it. And so on. I pick up a small paperback book with the title "Literary Edits" and think, that's my mother's book. I leave it on the bench. There is a baby somewhere. I get all my things packing into a cardboard box, square. The mostly eaten white cake on a rectangular plate was a bit too much. So I take that back out and now there is just enough room for all my things. I lay the photo album on top. Now I wonder how to get this heavy box carried to the car which my father had gone to get. I think I'll wait until help comes. But then I decide to try and push it up the steep hill as far as I can manage. I bend down and shove it slowly up the hill. I manage well getting to a t intersection of another sidewalk. Suddenly, a brown narrow vehicle which from the front looks like a very thin VW bug. My mother is driving it. I yell at her, Hey look out, I'm here. She didn't see me and almost ran over me. I step off the sidewalk in the grass. She stops and gets out. She says she's sorry she said what she said. I said It's Ok, but I haven't really forgiven her. I just wish to get on with business and not deal with it. Like it is finished business and I don't need to give energy to it. I am a little cool toward her. I walk around behind the vehicle wondering where I will sit and how the box will fit. I see a square space on the back with a mesh wire side. The box will fit there just fine. I notice she has several smaller versions of this vehicle parked on the lawn and a tiny one like a toy. I think my father must have bought them for her so she can get around better and be more independent. (422 words)

["Going to Las Vegas."] I am in some large room with Aunt Millie. We are talking about a workshop I attended that she is very interested in learning about. Some man and a woman, who had been featured on the Oprah Winfrey show. I said I could teach her the stuff I learned. She wants to learn. We are sitting on a large sort of couch platform chatting. Now we get up and walk across the room to a small kitchen area. Millie is mixing up some whipped cream in an unusual way. She has it poured out in a rectangle shape on what looks like a grill on a stove. She uses a whisk and the color of the cream is a milky blue. I comment on the unusual way she is doing it. I am interested. As she does this, I tell her that the three things that are most important to learn from the workshop is you must have a goal, drive and motivation. As we are talking I become aware of possible danger. It seems we are on a large ocean ship and huge whales, hairy black scary ones, are circling the ship. They are coming to eat us. I feel worried. I look out and see them deep in the ocean coming closer. One very hairy one surfaces and goes back down. I move toward the center of the room. I need to look in cupboards. I begin to open a large cupboard like a closet. I see a baby's hand poke out. Aunt Millie is very upset and says don't open that! Now I wonder if there's a dead or hurt baby that's been in there for a long time and did Aunt Millie have something to do with that? I try to shut the door again but it won't shut, the stuff that's in it won't go back in enough to shut. The feeling of fear now. A man suddenly enters the room from a door that leads to an elevator. He's come for us. Aunt Millie is going somewhere bad, like she will die. I think I am going with her, but the man says to me, No, you are going to Las Vegas. I walk into the elevator relieved it's not my time to die yet. (381 words)

["Picking up the garbage."] I am with a performance group. I am packing things. I go outside where a lot of garbage is piled up on a parking strip along a street. Lots of it is dead leaves, but there are lots of old broken things too. A lovely golden retriever dog comes to help pick up the garbage. She begins to work where the leaves are piled up. I and another woman are looking over the junk. She picks up a small clock. She says it works but it doesn't stop. I say well, that's because it's broken, sort of sarcastic, because it's in the junk pile for a reason, I would think. I look back where the dog is working and I am very impressed with how much she has accomplished. Long areas of fresh grass is exposed where the piles of dead leaves used to be. (145 words)

["Little blue aliens."] I am living in a run down apartment building. I want to go to the bathroom. I open the door out to the hall, as the bathroom is in another room across the hall. I see water all over the floor. I see Ellie in the bathroom as the door is open. She is looking at me concerned because there is water coming out of everywhere in the bathroom. She gestures for me to come see. I walk in and see water several inches deep on the left side of the room. I am concerned. I decide to go to the stairs at the right end of the hall. I open that door and see flooding water rising almost to our floor level. I am worried now. I go to the left end of the hall and find an odd sort of stone dungeon door which swings open to reveal a flight of old rough hewn stone stairs. I hear water flowing from somewhere, just as I heard water flowing at the other stairs. I walk down the stairs cautiously and round a bend to see that the stairs now went back up and around another corner. I see water flowing out of the ceiling in a corner. I go back to the hall and try and find my apartment. We have to get out of here. I look in one room near the left end and see a group of odd little blue men, obviously aliens. I grab one by the neck and hold a tree branch which forks at the end in my left hand. The alien is very afraid and breathes loudly. I realize they think the tree branch is a weapon as I hold it pointed at them like a gun. The group wants to rush me and save their companion, but are afraid to do it. There's another one of them at the right end of the hall and I keep swinging my neck back and forth to keep a wary eye on them all. I realize my right hand is at just the right place on the aliens neck to choke him if I have to. He knows that too. I make him walk with me as I look for Ellie and some kind of exit. I call to Ellie to find a fire escape. She says she found one in the bathroom. I walk, with the alien there, get to the window. Ellie goes down the fire escape. I release the alien and dart out the window and on down. The alien is very surprised I didn't kill or harm him. He realizes now I was just defending myself. I look back up and realize they are water breathing creatures and are filling the building up so they can survive. (467 words)

["Searching with kittens on my head."] A man shows me a video and tells me to watch closely. I watch trying to memorize all the objects and sequences. It's a test of some kind. The man watches me closely to see how I will do. After the complex video is done, he places many objects in boxes and pouches and tells me to search for a knife. I remember seeing a plastic like knife similar to a letter opener. On the video and begin looking where I think it might be. I search through a box, then along the table and then in a pouch and can't find it. I am frustrated. I keep searching over and over. Another woman now joins the search. It's a contest now. A small kitten is nearby. I think it is cute and pet it. I pick it up. The man adjusts its position so it is right under my chin to cuddle up by my neck. I would have preferred that the kitten be in my arms so I could enjoy looking at it. Now there are two kittens. Now they are on my head and I balance them as I continue the long search. Another man enters the room. I signal to him secretly where's the knife! I had found a pouch with a regular looking knife, but my memory was of a letter opener type. He points his head at the pouch. I mouth Is it the regular knife. He nods. The watching an is watching this even though we are trying to be hidden from him. I'm just not finding anything. It isn't going well. (269 words)

I am awake but in a hospital bed in "my" room. I have a small ceramic bowl with lots of little things in it. It keeps slipping and stuff falls out on the bed. Then Bonnie comes in and gets on the bed. I'm a bit annoyed because its very early in the morning. I toss a small ceramic "angel" at her. Here, I say, a gift. She says Oh, God! In frustration. It was such a graceless act of giving. Off handed. I just wanted to get rid of it. She goes into the bathroom and comes back. She's crying and exhausted. She says I just can't go to work now. It's so stressful. I say something empathetic, but I don't really mean it. She's in my space and I'm tired too. She says I'm worried. I may have cancer. I say me too. I'm worried I have cancer too, with all the things that have been going wrong lately. Then a young woman like Anastasia's ex friend comes in, only she's nice. She starts rearranging my room, putting up a partition and posters and decorations. What's going on I ask. She says we're celebrating the success of a poet. Some man. In my room? I ask. She cheerfully continues. I feel a bit jealous of this successful poet. Maybe he'll like me. I get up, exhausted. I return to find the whole place changed. I open a door and find the poet unpacking. Oh, it's you, I say. He looks vaguely familiar. I go back to my bedroom and see its all a party room. I look in another room to see my bed in a little alcove, with a pretty white cotton crocheted bedspread. I look at the bed. Very pretty, but no room for my wheelchair to pull up to the side.

["Breathing underwater."] I am preparing a staged area for some meeting. I am cleaning off a table and helping students place agendas and information on the tables. Part of the event involves diving underwater to great depths. I have a breathing mask on and I dive in, but can't get to the bottom, because the pressure is too great. I come back up and get some advise that if I switch the toggle switch from the top chest pack to the belly pack when nearing the depths, I will do better. I do that and find I can reach the bottom and breathe fine. I also see some residential people a family who lives down there and they are so acclimated they don't need any breathing apparatus.

She brings me a radio news story of how well I did. Later, I am given the job of organizing the children's paper dragon poster projects. I get some of the kids to bite and make designs on the edges of the papers and gather them all up to organize. I am doing a good job. (117 words)

["Toilet flow direction."] I am lying down at some gate like entrance to the beach and the ocean, waiting for my brother Jake. Lots of people go into the beach area. They are going to look for green round objects that might be food that drifts up on shore. One woman demonstrates her swimming stroke she will use in the ocean. I think to myself I can't swim. But maybe I can walk the beach and find some. As I wait, a "Royal Highness" who is the Minister of Something to the King comes by. They can't figure out when you push down on the flusher handle of a toilet how to regulate the direction of the water flow and which direction is the right one. I call out, "Your Royal Highness" and tell him that you could flush it and observe and then figure it out. I feel a bit embarrassed because this isn't any better information that what they are wondering. (160 words)

["Odd wheelchair."] I am in a public room, lots of people, like a classroom. A man that looks like Michael J. Fox has a very unique wheelchair that he can transform into a blue sled bed and it will recline. He is manipulating it very fast and it doesn't fix up right. I watch with interest. What a neat gadget to have. Then I am holding boxes and boxes of checks from banks, each one belongs to a man in the room. I choose one and now I must find out what man I chose that belongs to the checks. A man apparently owns those checks, I look for him and hand back the other boxes to their owners. I am disappointed to see that the man took his box of checks and left. I guess I will see him later, as he is chosen. (143 words)

I hesitate to show her my writing part, before she does the official critique, because I don't want to prejudice or influence her decisions. But I say you must take a look at the illustrations. They are wonderful. Someone else did them. I fold a page or two over so she can see the colorful illustrations. I tell her that two men are doing this work. They are "howling about God." One is a Jew and another is Catholic. (106 words)

There is a handle on a long mechanical arm like my joystick mechanism laying on the left, not attached. I try and get it to be where it belongs. I see now I have to drive up a steep embankment to get to the road, which is narrow and lots of parked cars along it. It's more like a driveway. I hit the gas and roar up the embankment leaning forward in case we tip over. But we make it just fine. Now I am trying to turn around so we can leave but the brakes aren't working hardly at all. I press hard but we keep rolling. I hit something. A passenger from the back says it's OK. You didn't do much damage. Let's go. I say no, I have to talk with the owner of that object first. The passenger says it's not a problem. They won't care. I say, Even so, I must talk with a grown up about it before I leave. (202 words)

I walk through several rooms and find the post office. I walk up to the counter and can vaguely see a woman. I hand her the letter I am sending and turn to walk away. Then I realize that I was actually seeing the reflection of myself in a mirror and had laid the letter down on the counter. It will never get sent. I pick it back up. The guy is following me, teasing. He's supposed to be doing research on me (my dreams I think) and he's not doing it. I go to another room where the professor (like Milton Kramer) is seated. I say to him, I understand that the original research information of mine isn't as valid anymore. But this guy is missing out on current research he could be doing on me and the others. He has forgotten your theories. (201 words)

Charla and I are walking down a hall. We are looking for a table to sit at. I walk past a man who I don't trust. I choose to go around the corner and find a table away from him. I put my papers and things on the table. The man is at a slightly higher level and looking down at our table. He makes me nervous. I am afraid he will take my things.

The man grins at me and tries to sit at the table with me. I say to him, sharply, stay away. I don't want you near here. I scoop up my papers and hold them close to me.

["Traveling with the natives."] I'm traveling down a dirt road in an Asian country. All the peasants are walking and I am riding a very tall plastic blow up animal. It is mechanized so it moves along. I am way up higher than everyone. The animal is a sort of black ostrich looking thing. I come to a bridge over the road, like another highway going perpendicular. I am too high, so I push a button and the hydraulics of the machine shortens the thing enough so I can get under it. The peasants ignore me, they do not like having me there. They do not respect me. Later, the peasants are running toward the fields and I hear an airplane coming. I realize I am in danger and shorten the machine down to the road and then run with the peasants into the weeds in the field. We hide until the airplane passes. We come out. I see shimmery pamphlets lying all over the road. They could explode if we stepped on them. I now get off my machine and pick up clothes and shoes from dead people on the road so that I am now dressed and acting like a peasant. It is my protection. We come into a room. I am more accepted now. (213 words)

I hold the right sides of the diaper together at her waist and the man is trying to get the tape on it. We try several times with no luck. Then I notice we are taping the tape at one end on the diaper and then the other end to the outside of the car door. This won't work, I think, because she will want to get out of the car eventually. Then I see the front of the diaper isn't forward enough to protect, so I pull on the front. I see blood from her period on it but am happy I could successfully get it positioned correctly.

He wonders what it's like to be in a power wheelchair and I get out of mine and choose another chair, which is like a walker with wheels and a chair seat. It is black.

Now we are seated at a dining table, other guests and staff are there. He had placed a package at my place. I open the soft tissue paper wrapping and find a beautiful gold filigree worked necklace with Jade stones on it. Also several rings with jade stones on them.

["Traveling on the different side of the road."] I am getting into a car. I can't decide where the safest place to sit in the back is. I see three wooden chest drawers where the trunk ought to be. I slide one out and decide this could fall out with me in it. So I get in the rumble seat, open convertible seat. No back there. But then there is a back, so I stay there. I am with some other women. I had packed some things. Now the car is a open convertible black limo and I am in the back seat hanging onto the top of a black derby hat the driver is wearing. We are driving down the streets of London England. The buildings are high skyscrapers. There are many shelves filled with wares to buy along the front of the buildings. I am swiveling my head back and forth to try and see everything. I might want something to buy. A street hawker runs with us yelling "water." Over and over. I see a paper in his hand with my name "Barbara" written on it. I smile as it is obvious he got the info off my license plate and is marketing to me. I say I already have enough water. He then changes his call to "California water for sale" and runs to another car. He calls the driver "Mayor" and I think that odd that he'd mistake the driver for the mayor. There is an odd extra strap of material on the top of the hat I can slide my hand into for more secure hold. One object I saw on the shelves was a beautiful rose pink glass bowl. (278 words)

The charlatan man has many of his supporters in the class to try and keep the discussion on proving his theory. I wear a long pastel colored flowing robe. I am in the back of the classroom and see some rolled up papers of his I touch them and they stick to my hand as I hurriedly try to put them back, regretting that I had touched them.

I walk to the front of the room to begin the discussion class. They pepper me with questions that are set up to lead to his conclusions. I am too smart for that and dodge the questions and redirect the discussion to normal physics and science issues I was teaching in the first place. (214 words)

I choose a yellow long skirt and matching top of a kind of silky material. It is tight on me, showing my plumpness. I try on the boots. One, the right side, is very tiny. The yellow insoles come out easily. The left one is very large and the top of the boot is not sewn on. The insoles also come out. I walk downstairs and feel awkward and ugly. (136 words)

["Poetry meeting costs too much."] I am in a rec room or meeting room with a few people. We are the few remaining members of some club. Maybe a dream club or a poetry club. We are trying to figure out why we have so few members left. A man, like Bob van de Castle is there. A woman is seated on a couch. A board member, perhaps. She says she thinks the reason is that we've raised the club dues too high so the cost is prohibitive. People dropped out or lost interest. They decide to drop the fee level so people would be encouraged to come back. I ask Charla and her boyfriend to come read some poetry (dreams?) and then I am taking some trip down a hill "back home" to high school times. I also ask a woman poet if I can use one of her earlier poems to do something with. Maybe add a photograph or artistic expression to it. Maybe collaborate with her. She is hesitant. A good looking but aging man (dark Italian) comes up to "me" a beautiful woman in an evening dress and professes his life long love for me from many years past. He hugs me and still adores me.

They call themselves the Cousins. A group of women, the women cousins, come in too. I, the dream ego observes as these acrobatic people do complicated circle dances. (Now many members of the group.) As they flip and dance in unison moving in circle and counter clockwise inner circles, like the apertures of a camera lens moving to open and close. It is colorful, graceful and a big spectacle. The dream ego now seems to be a member of the dancing group, trying to think up routines for the group to display. An improv routine to keep the audience interested. (192 words)

["Square box boat."] I row out to a square boat in a small rowboat. It is the ocean. I get on the square boat. It is high tech and automated. I decide it would be wise to keep my rowboat with me in case I need it in an emergency. I try to tie it up so it will trail along behind. I find some nails and hammer them into the floor of the square boat. I then see a glass vial. I must put the end of the rope in the vial and then wrap the rope around it and the nail. I am having trouble getting it to stay firm and safely strong enough. I look down a square open hole and see lots of boxes and things. I guess it is the place where I'll sleep and rest. Like the cabin. I sense someone else, a man is on board. I see a shadow pass when I look up from concentrating on getting the rope properly in the vial. The shadow creeps back behind a box. I finally manage to get the rope tied. I sit on the box and push a button. That will start the automatic process and we will go. I won't even have to steer. (209 words)

I should give them back to her. I go back into the store. She watches closely. I'm pretty sure she sees I have some of her things. (123 words)

Then as I walk away, a man complains. I return to hear him. He shows me a list of classic books he felt we should have studied. He showed me a handful of pills, big orange capsules and small round ones I didn't recognize and complained he'd gotten those to take during the class instead of two Tums usually given out. Meanwhile, during the class I had a baby to take care of as the people watched. I tried to get him to take a nap. I finally succeeded. (164 words)

Lots of activities going on, people talking and so on. I need to have a piece of paper signed. I walk up some stairs to a room. I see a desk with drawers and open them. I decide to take and keep some of the things in there. I figure its OK because no one seems to be there that owns them. I go to another room and try to talk with some very busy people to get them to sign my paper. They hardly have a moment to even listen. I finally get one man to sign it. I return to the radio station. I can hear the broadcast. I find my desk and open a drawer, the middle one. Some teen kids are in trouble and I want to help them. I see lots of wedges of red cabbage and forks, knives and spoons. I worry I will not be able to eat all that cabbage and it will spoil. I feel guilty about taking the forks and so on. I decide to take some back to where I got it. I find a plastic sack with cards I had bought. I am upset with myself I had bought them. A waste of money, I do that too often. I am mad at myself.

I live in a house with lots of clothes and things lying untidily on the floor and furniture. I am looking around for Fluffy. I suddenly realize I'd nearly stepped on Bootsie. I hadn't seen her as she was curled up on some clothes. Bonnie visits. I show her I'd been looking at some photos she'd given me in clear plastic frames. One 8 by 10 of an old man I don't know. I wonder where I will hang these. I don't want to hang the one of the man I don't know. I tell Bonnie I'd been looking at the photos. I feel a bit guilty. It's taken me so long. Then Bonnie opens the blinds on a back window. I am surprised as she had a movie poster and some little ornaments. I didn't want her to do that. But I look out the window at the back yard. I am surprised to see that there is a caged area full of chickens and sheep and a llama. These are my neighbors animals but obviously in my backyard. I had thought my backyard ended much before this. Then I look back in the room and see Bootsie curled up. I see her left back foot is very swollen and she is in pain. I am concerned. I feel terrible. I must have stepped on her and caused this injury. I pick her up gently and pet her, checking out the foot more carefully. I see her face is pink from loss of fur. I feel very badly for her and am determined to help her heal. (268 words)

I am in a house. Apparently I rent several rooms to foreign ambassadors. I am very negligent in keeping things clean. I also hardly ever interact with the ambassadors. I regret that now, wishing I'd made more of an effort to get to know them. I must seem very distant and unfriendly to them. I have trouble sorting out piles of paper and parts that have something to do with computers. I try and clean up a machine I hurriedly place a fresh aerosol can of something on a shelf in the new ambassadors room. It is behind something, so it isn't easy for them to notice and find. I wish I'd done that better. (115 words)

["Stay of execution indictment."] I only have 2 hours to live before I am executed. I find it shocking to imagine not existing anymore. I feel fear. I must present myself to the court for my execution. I walk there. A woman lawyer says to me, you can file a stay of execution indictment and they have to hear the appeal. I almost off handedly say Oh, I don't know. I mean the thing is already scheduled and I don't want to upset anything. Then it occurs to me that not dying might be a good thing anyway. Then I feel a bit of remote resentment that my "crime" was merely to be invaded in my home by other people like a burglar. It didn't seem fair. So I finally agree to file the indictment. Then some children with red hair want to go to the movies. The smallest doesn't. I vaguely think going to a movie would be fun, since I'm not going to die. But I tell the child he can go home. I send one of the other kids to walk with him home. Then after they leave I realize that would leave the child alone. So I go and watch him and give up the movie. (206 words)

I am in a building, a bar or performance area. I see two women who are part of an improv group performing. They are good. I walk up some stairs to see them. They suggest we walk across the street to go into a gift/drug store. They start walking with more people up the street. I cross the street, wondering if I misunderstood where we were going. They realize I was right and swing across the street. We go in, and split up to look at different sections. I say I'll go look at the light fixtures and things. I see some Xmas decorations on a turn around rack. Then I'm talking with a man about a plumber. They want me to sign up for their construction company. I become aware they (like the women) are Saturday Market types. I am hesitant to sign with them. I keep asking questions about prices and services. They insist I have to sign up right away. I want more time to consider. I start to walk back to the original place. I see a woman on a bench and I sit by her. She starts talking about her friend and her had raised Jake and Dwight. She did not understand why their mom left them. I get angry and touchy. I say in righteous haughtier, do you mean me? The mother of Jake and Dwight? You don't understand why I had to leave them? She looks at me with disgust. I don't see why you left them to be raised by others. I indignantly show her my hands. I had severe RA. I say. Probably faking it, she sniffed. Then she sees my hands and looks startled. Now she believes me. I get up and stalk off angry. I am back at the music bar. A man comes in to tell me the names of the 2 plumbers who will work my job. Scott D. someone and another man. I recognize them as Saturday Market people. I feel very rushed into this and unsure they will be fair, honest or dependable. (348 words)

["Vampires."] I am talking to someone on the phone. I feel a bite on my arm and see a small circle with an "x" in it on my arm. I realize with foreboding that I have been bitten by a vampire. I tell the woman (possibly Anastasia) this happened. I say I am now a vampire forever. I didn't want this. She insists. I call and find out how to cancel out being a vampire. Now I am standing with a group of people saying to the handsome dark haired vampire man, "but you see, I didn't get a chance to say no to the subscription of the vampire club." He says in a smooth sinister voice that all rules were announced and if I was bitten then I must have accepted the rules. They can't be changed. I say but I never heard the rules. He repeats himself and we go into a verbal loop of repetition. I say, this is like the army. He stands very close, very seductive. I shutter and move my neck away from him. He laughs at me. He finally agrees I will be unvampired. A woman plays the recording of my phone conversation and I have to agree I sounded dumb about vampires, but I don't want to be one. (216 words)

["Hector and me on his graduation day."] I heard that Hector is having his last class in school as today is graduation day. I decide I want to visit him and say hello and congratulations. I drive to the school. It is some small town, like M City. I see a woman I know who I owe money to. I pay her back. Two things done at the same time. That feels good. I enter the school building and pass three or four doors to classrooms. I am not sure which one to enter. I see the office area and ask a man at the desk. He walks me to the classroom and uses an odd reaching device to pull open the door for me. I thank him saying that's a neat device. He apologizes there wasn't a more accessible door for me. I enter a long room about the size of a small gym. The class is seated way in the front. The spectators are in the back. I park my wheelchair in the spectator line. I see the teacher, who is famous for his excellent teaching lecturing. He is talking about Native Americans. Apparently Hector is Native American. A class of elementary school children listen and then leave. Another group comes in. They are seated along the side wall on the bleachers. More spectators come in. I see the teacher is wearing an Elizabethan gown and tights. He is wearing his PHD costume. A pleasant friendly man on my right places his hand gently on my shoulder. I like that. I feel loved. I watch and look for Hector. I finally see him in a grey blue checkered shirt and wearing earphones on his head. He's listening to music as the teacher is lecturing. I smile at him, not sure if he sees me or not. Now I stand up on the side wall area, in front of my wheelchair. Small children are playing at my feet, rolling through me legs and giggling. I smile at them and smile at Hector. The teacher hands some papers to the students and they pass the pick flyer around. He asks them to read the poem on it. Each student reads a line from the poem. It is a nice poem. Something about the moon. Hector gets elbowed by another student and takes his earphones off and reads a line. He smiles at me. It is a pleasant dream. I feel great respect for the teacher and affection for Hector on their graduation day. Apparently the teacher is retiring and this is his last day too. (428 words)

Someone is nice and opens a curtain for me to slip through. I am now backstage. Blocked. I see a tall curtain and see a rip in the end seam. I crawl into the curtain rather than behind it. The authorities come and check that area. I can see their shapes through the curtain. I lean back when they feel the area I am in. They somehow miss me. They leave. Then I escape unharmed.

Paulina, Lance, Charla and I and others are visiting someone's house. We had stayed overnight and it is time to get up early and pack, fix breakfast and leave. I walk out of the bedroom, seeing Charla's feet under some blankets in another room, in a bed. She is snoring. There is a high step from one room to the other that is hard for me to negotiate. I go to the kitchen. Paulina is already there. I am trying to cook some scrambled eggs. I have layers of newspaper over the burners that I had turned on. Now I am digging them off the surface worried I've started a fire. Many layers, never ending. Then I find the red-hot burner and put the small frying pan on it. I stir the mess which is thick eggs. I am also cleaning up as I go. Lance has moved some cabinets with drawers in them across the entrance to the kitchen. I ask him how I am supposed to get out of the room. He then sees my way is blocked and tries to fix it. I put some nuts I'd been eating into what I thought was the garbage can. I realize it is a huge can of peanuts that aren't yet eaten. I try to remember I need to clean my mess up. I go back to the bedroom and see Paulina has already been there packing up my things. I see a pile of magazines which I'd checked out of the library. I realize I've mixed up some of my aunt's magazines with this pile and am having a hard time separating out theirs from the library ones. I wonder why I went to the library and checked them out if we had such a limited time to read as we are leaving soon. Now I notice that there is a terrible hurricane coming up. I call out to everyone to go to the cellar. Charla is asleep. I go to her and finally have to pick her up and carry her as she wouldn't wake up. My grown son who is gay and his fiancee are there, after the winds and rain die down. The fiance's parents are there and have written a check for $273 dollars for their wedding gift. I and my husband (or Lance) are worried our gift isn't nearly as generous even though it is all we can afford. He wants to write a bigger check. I say no, I think we gave $100 or $150. It is fine. Even though I feel guilty. (431 words)

She doesn't understand. The man sees a woman in a golden shape that is like a cage. Then the woman stands in the burning coals and flames. The man goes into it to be with her. He wants to kiss her. She resists and the man backs her gently into a corner and kisses her. They step out of the flames. An older woman or witch tells them to park their bicycle in a particular spot. He wants to park where he can get a better view so he can understand what's going on. The woman is now outside sort of in a trance. A spirit comes by. The man/me looks out the window tentatively. The spirit turns out to be a "grandma." She stands near the door. (162 words)

I am preparing a performance. I write a story or script. I choose to make my own part fairly small so the memorization won't be too much work or pressure. I am now going in to a public bathroom. A boy stands behind me, hiding under my skirts. He and I walk in tandem so no one will know he's there. We wear some kind of weird braces on our feet. As we go into the disabled stall, some woman is outraged and says "The nerve." She's not disabled. Then another woman is suspicious I'm sneaking a man into the bathroom and we might have sex. I laugh. The boy is a brother. A sister is nearby. Now I am preparing to rehearse the script with "my man." He has shoulder length black hair. I want him to nonchalantly enter and go to the band leader's stand and slowly take the music, being a drummer, and making the music go from slow to wild and rhythmic. The band is rehearsing. I say to the drummer (up at the top of the bleachers) try to play wimpy so he has something to build from. He laughs. Him play wimpy?? But he tries, for me. Now I am looking in a mirror with my "man." I want him to comb his hair different. I suggest a side part, like I do with my hair. He can't seem to get it combed that way. I help him. As we brush his hair to the side, it turns blue and his face turns blue. It's a nice muted color but we agree his hair looks better than the way it was originally. (278 words)

A plane is loading its passengers. I am the last in line. I wait. The Queen from some foreign country is on board. She is dying.

It's wheelchair accessible. Now I am called to visit the Queen. I go to the front of the plane to the private room the Queen is in. She is veiled. I say shame on you for causing harm to your people for your own selfish reasons. She wearily pulls off her veil. I see two sets of blue eyes. She asks me my name. I tell her. She asks me to print it out for her. I do. My full name. She fills out a paper and names me the new Queen when she dies. She is happy with her choice as I will take good care of her people. Then I see a small baby rolling off a shelf. She seems to be OK. The maid comes in. I had used the commode and she concentrates on cleaning the commode. The Queen chides her for paying attention to the mundane when the momentous occasion of her death and the new Queen is more important. Then the Queen does and I go out to see the Prime Minister who is ready to take over. He is shocked to discover I am officially the new Queen. The Queen and I before she died spent some time talking about the country. Is it poor? Yes. What resources are there? Rocks. Then we'll make the world love rocks. I have good plans to make life better for the people. (300 words)

I come to visit my mother who lies very ill in her house. I go outside to get something from the camper van. I go in there and a small boy is napping in there. Paulina's boy and Paulina is off doing something this morning. He wakes up very glad to see us. We go outside and walk in the thick snow. He runs and laughs and falls on his back. I help him up and a yellow dog rushes up to us playfully and the dog frolics around me. I pet it. Then Valerie comes up. We go to the back of the van. I open it, looking at the piles of books and dream program notes. I go into the van camper with Valerie (sister-in-law). I start to sob about my mother. I reach out my hand and we hold hands sympathetically. She says I'd go visit her but the house smells. I say my mother's so ill and my father never does that well cleaning and Sally doesn't come very often. I think to myself that Valerie could come over and clean it up if it was so bad for her. But I don't say it. Now we walk back to the house the snow is gone. I ask where it went. It melted away so fast. I am near the door and am happily shocked to see my mother up and smiling and laughing. It is wonderful to see her like that. I wonder now she can do that as she is very ill. She darts around manic happy. Then I see her vomit blood into a long slim glass vial with round series of bubbleglass in it. I realize she is still very ill but somehow is managing this energetic happiness. She says we all need to move in with her because then she will be happy. I hesitate and say No. I can't move in. It feels like a no win situation. A trap. (330 words)

["Paulina's bookstore."] Dovre and I are in a room of Paulina's Bookstore. It is a mess and we are trying to help her clean it up. We are picking up books off the floor. Dovre finds two of them she wants to keep. I take them to another room where Paulina is and ask her if Dovre and I can keep these books. I feel guilty because we aren't offering to pay her for them. She nods, but I decide to put them back on the table to be sold. I ask her which table. She says the "B's." I look at one table. She says no. I look at the next table. She says no, then I see they are in alphabetical order and find the "B" table. I straighten up some newspapers laying on the books and find a place for them. They are slim volumes and are almost covered or lost next to the larger books. (157 words)

["Fabulous pool in the motel room."] I and Charla and Ginny are staying at a motel. I wake up in the morning and go to the next room to see if Ginny has left yet. She has not. Another couple of children, including a young girl are with her, so she will be staying for awhile. We decide to have a big breakfast. I order a stack of pancakes. For some reason I don't eat them. It might make me feel bad. Then Rochelle is there in her wheelchair. Her hair is styled very nicely. I remark how nice she always looks. The young girl is trying to talk to her and she doesn't notice she is there. I point her out to Rochelle so she won't accidentally run over her. Then I notice a huge swimming pool in another room. I dive in boots, jeans and all and splash around with the kids. The pool turns into a playing field with lots of water on it. After we are done playing, I go into yet another room and see Rochelle in a purple pretty nightgown, only she must weigh 300 pounds now. She sits in a bathtub, but with no water in it. She asks me to splash some water onto her like we were doing in the play field. She has another favor to ask me but never finishes asking it. I stand there waiting, but she just stops speaking. I then go look out a window and see below a huge bedroom. It is the bedroom of the King. He bed itself is huge. The pillows are bigger than a person and take up half the bed. A train of sorts like on formal dresses is trailing from the bed a long distance. I see bishops and cardinals coming in and watch as they do the ritual putting on of robes and red colorful shawls and things. The King is standing to one side talking with an attendant. I realize I am watching a play. I remember this play from another time. I see people walking under the huge bedside table. They look like little dolls next to the tall legs of the table. I listen to the words and can't decide if this is a play I saw before or another play. I decide it is a different play, but written by the same author. The bride of the King is missing, perhaps run away. I see hangings on the wall that tell me that. It's fun to be peaking at this spectacle from the high window. Then I turn and look back into our room. Charla has decided to go up into an attic through the trap door. She rummages around and the door is shut. I get worried and call to her to come back down. She does so, finally, with a loud bump of the door slamming shut after her. (481 words)

["Varnishing the painting."] I am in a one room apartment. I want to finish up some projects that have been laying around the place for a long time. I see a painting of a man's face. I dip it in varnish, not only the frame, but the entire painting. Then I hold it upside down to let the excess varnish drip off. It feels good to finish a project. I try and sit in the one chair, a modern looking reclining chair. But there are plants draped all around it from hanging plants above it. I pull away some chunks of dead plants to make room for me. I sit there looking at the completely cleared off counters along the wall. I haven't seen it cleared off in years. Now the door flies open. A young girl comes in and three dogs with her. More dogs are in the hall outside. I try to talk her into leaving again, and taking her dogs with her. But she sees my kittens and wants to play with them. I step out into the hall and see lots of people. Ginny and I are going to drive away down the hall in a car, but it is crowded. (202 words)

["Going to Alaska."] I am cleaning up, putting things I want to fix in a pile. A jacket with a torn pocket. Ginny comes in and as I am moving things, she helps. I see she put the things in a suitcase. My large black one. I say no, I need that suitcase to pack for Alaska. So I start to take the things out, fat bottle brushes, empty mason jars, clothes and so on. I go back into my room and into the walk in closet. I choose clothes, asking Ginny should I take this jacket, (the one needing a rip in the pocket fixed). She says no. I say it could get cold there, it is Alaska, after all. She says I won't need the jacket. I choose a few outfits and pack them into the suitcase. Then I find the suitcase I'd used the last time I traveled to Alaska. Some books and papers and projects there I could work on. I pack them too. (165 words)

I grab her and take the pins out of her mouth before she swallows them. I am distressed. She is dying. She leaps off the bed and races upside down on the ceiling. I am very surprised at this. Then she leaps to the floor and pushes herself violently against a large crib on the left side of the room. She is on her back and I see her anus poke out and a carrot like object come out and back in. I realize she is dying and feel sad. (127 words)

["Dover State University."] I have decided to go back to school to take classes on dreams. I am in the halls. A short man comes by and asks me if I need help. He is a representative of the disabled student unit there. I go with him to his office. His name is Beirdy or something like that. He offers help. Then I go down another hall and find a catalog of classes. It has a small pamphlet with insert pages in it, on brown recycled paper. Very cheaply done. But economical. I realize I've chosen to take a general psychology class and wonder if this will have the right kind of information in it. I begin to doubt my decision to return to school. Jake is around somewhere. I go out to find my van. It is parked on the street. I get into it and see a note from a parking meter person saying they were going to ticket me for illegally parking, but they saw in what bad shape the van is in and took pity on me assuming I couldn't afford to fix the van. I was thankful. (189 words)

["Home with Mom and Dad."] I am at a house I've never seen before in waking life. It is supposedly my parents' house. Long and rambling. I am at the back door which is opened. It has been several days of bad weather and the snow is piled up around the door and on the floor in the hall area at the door so that the bathroom door is blocked with snow. I see the rain and snow has stopped. Charla is outside with some of her friends. I sit down on the snow bank on the floor inside the house and I kick at the melting snow outside. It causes chunks to roll down the steep hill and finally I clear out all the snow this way. A friend of Charla's then goes into the bathroom. Now I stand and use a shovel to clear away stones and silt that is many inches think all over the floor in the room. From the floods. I shovel and shovel. Then I decide I'd better get my parents' permission because I'm just shoveling it out the door, black plastic pieces in it and all. Making a mess out there. I walk over the stony floor to the next room and through that room to another one on the right and down a step. I see a dining room table and my parents are talking with a couple. They look up and say this is private business. I apologize and leave the room to wait. The couple comes out talking about some real estate deal in Vancouver my parents are trying to convince them to buy. I go back in the room. My mother is not there. My father is and Dwight and a Doctor. He has the results of my blood test. He speaks but I can't understand him. I tell him to repeat it because I am deaf in my left ear. He is annoyed and walks over near my right ear. I continue to have trouble hearing him. He says the blood levels are low. I say is that good or bad? He says something about the Orphan Syndrome and low blood levels are a good sign that my Orphan Syndrome isn't too bad. He is referring to how I was raised as a child. I am relieved it is good. But unclear what it is and can't get the right information because he's too annoyed with me. I am frustrated. (407 words)

["Expanding the building."] I go into a building. I need to speak to a man in a particular department. I enter the main lobby. I want to write a note to him. I find many sticky yellow sheets of paper and try to find one which hasn't already been written on, on both sides. I can't find one after searching diligently for a long time. I write down 1 A2 on an already used paper. I try to go up an elevator but it is wobbly and I am worried it will break. I go back out realizing the building is not safe and needs fixing. I get into my van and proceed to drive up the tunnels in the building. The tunnel is white, rounded and narrow and going up. As I drive, I realize I am creating a better situation. The tunnels are now more wide and easy to go through. The building structure itself is stronger and better built. I feel nervous in the narrow tunnel as I drive quickly up to the top. I get out and go back to the lobby. Not many people there. I take the elevator again. The window screen seems wobbly and I stand away from it, nervous it will fall open and I will fall out. Then the elevator stops. I try and push buttons to get it to go up to the 5th floor and then we can go back down to the 4th, which is the floor I want. I works and I get off at the 4th floor. I notice no one is in the waiting room, still thin of company. I feel slightly uppity about that. (277 words)

It is the end of the afternoon and I want to finish the day of work. I ask Rosie O'Donnell a question. She seems to be unconscious. I shake her to wake her. She doesn't wake up. I look at her more closely. There are words appearing on her skin, like she is answering the question or talking in writing. Meanwhile a student like Mateo asks permission to go to the bathroom. I am annoyed because he wears a glove like paint (blue and white) on his hand and he is waving his hand up in the air. I realize later this meant he wasn't coming back. I continue to try and wake Rosie who remains unconscious. I am frustrated. (145 words)

It can't be opened fully, because Jake's body lies in the way. I see he is dead. I go back downstairs to Dwight's bedroom. I see he is dead. I go back to the kitchen and ask Charla to show her wound. She shows me two healed scars where a bullet went through just below her knee from the back to the front. Now I walk into the living room. People are arriving, to ask questions. I tell them they can move back the couch from the desk, which is in the center of the room. They do so and ask me questions. I answer from a stunned sorrow. (225 words)

I am in the back seat of a car. A couple, both with dark hair are my friends. The man is driving and the woman and I are in the backseat. We are near an ocean. I see on the left side of the road the huge prow of a ship coming up on land. 3 or 4 people are trying desperately to avoid being run over. I notice a key ring with 2 keys in my hand. I suddenly remember I hadn't taken my pills the night before or this morning. I have a moment of fear about that. I remind myself to take them when we arrive at our destination. I think its' the day (Thurs.) to eat the oatmeal but it is only Tuesday. We now turn off the coast highway and drive down hill on a small road, past other houses and so on to a house that the couple just bought. The woman watches my face for my expression. She's excited about me liking the house. I am curious and get out of the car. A small boy (theirs) is there. When the mom isn't looking, he sneaks a swig off my coke bottle.

There are a number of them but not enough of the right kind. (coumadin 2.5's) I sigh and feel worried. Then Bill asks a question of a woman student who didn't know the answer.

I am in some resort hotel room. I decide to take a shower. It is a very wide open shower area, in the large open room. There isn't any furniture in there. A flimsy shower curtain is across the door to the room. A woman, perhaps my sister in law, Corinne, is trying to lock the curtain after she left. She is going to get something. I pick up a notebook which has the events that will happen later that night all written out. I see that I shall see about 5 movies in a row until 2am in the morning. It all feels laid back and relaxed. Another woman and her friend is industriously trying to work with a shape in a closet like area in the hall. I peek in and see a green painted square on the side wall. I come back into the room, still interested in having a shower at some point. (157 words)

I look in the cupboard and find several old hotdogs in bread like a folded sandwich. I ask him if one is his. He says it is. He says I can have it. I decide to throw mine away as it is old and probably would make me sick. I am being sympathetic with my father being alone now. Then my mother comes in and falls. I go to her but she has already gotten up. I am worried because she fell like that already this morning. She says, looking bleary eyed, a bum head. Then she pauses and rethinks. No, she says, a bone hip, meaning a hip joint giving out on her. She stumbles out of the kitchen. She is going somewhere. I am worried, but see that Dwight is following her everywhere. He will take care of her. My father is sad. (193 words)

I ask them if they are here to only audition for the McScrooge part or if they are interested in other parts as well. One wears cotton fake sideburns. He is only interested in the McScrooge part. I decide to audition these men first so they can leave after that part is worked with. Now the scene changes and I am working in secret with a naval situation. I am standing on a submarine and moving a yellow cloth up and down on a rack, like a towel rack. I am in danger of being discovered as a spy, so I go high up on a shelf of dirt. I hide there. They are looking for me. I am very aware that I am sitting on an edge of the cliff and am slipping. I could fall and kill myself. I cling to the edge hard, worried I will fall. I keep scooting back away from the edge and then slipping back toward it. I feel fear. Then there is an odd sequence where I am experiencing sexual excitement. Lydia is touching Dwight and transferring the feelings into me. I don't know how she is doing this because Dwight isn't there at all.

["Asking dream character what he means."] I am in a large building, and I am talking to a woman who says she has her kids in a large garage adjacent to the room we are in. I am concerned and go peek in a crack in the wall to see if it is safe for them. I decide it is OK. I am leaving now. I look to my left and see a tall man. I realize I am dreaming and decide to ask him a question so I say to him, "What do you mean in this dream?" He speaks but his words are unintelligible. I ask him to repeat it. He does and again I can not understand him. Then he says something I think is "Cat Stevens." I am doubting if I heard it correctly. Then he simply disintegrates, starting with his head. So I walk on out. Now I am visiting at a mansion of a very rich man. As I come in a woman comes out and says you're in for it. I say why, is he an alcoholic? She says yes. I walk across a huge room with very high ceilings and carpet and classical pictures on the wall. I am critical of this room. If I had lots of money, I'd decorate it better. Then I notice my shoes clicking on marble flooring. We get to his room which is a wooden desk in a beautiful library, wall to wall books. This is more like it. I like this room. He cynically asks me to make love to him. I chuckle and say no thanks. He is not used to being rebuffed. I leave and go to a quiet place by a river and sit there comfortably with a camp chair and watch the water swirl gently by. He follows me there. He wants to know why I won't make love to him. I am concerned that my place look really good, since I had criticized his so much. There is a sort of muddy spot near where I am sitting. I will it to look better. I now throw bits of bread crumbs to some kind of animal (squirrel or raccoon) nearby. (364 words)

["The huge turd."] I am reminiscing about a time when I was chosen to be the lead MC of some event. And one of the things that happened was in the event, I notice a huge turd on a school desk. This is some speaking event. A man like Ben Affleck is now seated in a school desk and asking me, "So I hear that you did something that got my mom really upset. Tell me about it. I blush and laugh embarrassed to tell about it. He says you remember my mom, right? Italian? I say Oh yeah. Plump, really dark hair. I remember. He describes his father. I say Him I don't remember. So he keeps pressing me to tell the story. I keep hesitating and laughing. He says his father had some affair. I say I don't really remember. So I say OK, so I'd been chosen by Jackie Gleason to be the lead moderator. He whistles how impressed he is and appreciates how important that is. I then tell him how I see the huge turd on the desk. He laughs, appreciating how embarrassing that would be and agrees no wonder his mom was so upset. We laugh. (199 words)

["Multi layered Paulina."] I am in a series of rooms. I am looking through drawers and trying to organize all the things I find. I find an old shirt I wore many years ago and can't see any spots or messes or rips on it. I then see a few, because I am convinced there has to be some. Then as I am about to toss it in the goodwill pile, I see I'd hung many of my necklaces on the same hanger so I keep it all. I find many small cloth pouches that jewelry might have been kept in. I gather them all up in one place. My mother is around there somewhere. Children are around and make noise. It spooks the horses outside. I go to a back window and warn Dwight they might try and stampede. I see small groups of horses in small barbed wire squares and see they can't break out though they whinny and raise up on their hind legs. I am relieved. I continue with my organizing project. Now Jerry and I are in a room and I say you need to relate to me how you fixed two items of mine and I will write it down. He tries to remember. He finally says well, I sort of looked at them and jiggled them and then they worked. I try and write this down on a framed glass sheet. That is the shape of Dwight's stamp B'day gift. I say Oh, so you sort of didn't do anything and they worked just fine. We laughed. Now I am at a dinner table with lots of people. Paulina is there. She is standing in front of me showing off her new work uniform. I say I see what you mean about multi layers. I see 3 or 4 different colored shirts a gold one, a green one and a white one, an off the shoulder peasant blouse. I say they want you to be sexy but keep it hidden. She also has on a large billowy jeans dress that makes her look a hundred pounds larger than she is. (354 words)

I am standing on a lawn in front of a white house shaped like the Mac House, but it is not. A horrible plant is growing out of a small buried mess of body parts in the lawn. It is angry. Its leaves are like tentacles reaching out to try and grab me, to kill me. I had been lazy and irresponsible when I buried the stuff there. I run madly and it grows very fast to try and get me. I run down a street near a parked car. The tentacles could only reach that far and it is screaming (Sounds like Godzilla) with fury and frustration that I am just out of its reach. I stand there listening to its screams and watches as it dies. I walk around the block to stay safely out of its way. Someone insists I go back and look at it now that it is dead. I am fearful to do so, but I do it. I am afraid it will spring to life and kill me. I wake up, afraid. Nightmare. (180 words)

My green van is broken and a man is inside fixing it. I want to explain to him some info so he can do it better. Gaston walks up to tell me, laughing at me gently, not to bother the man. I see a small fluffy dog hop out of the van and get on a small skateboard. He skates under another van (sort of a duplicate of my green van.) It is jacked up and Gaston gets under there to assist the dog out. I am worried he will accidentally knock the van off its jack. It might fall. I ask him to get out of there. It's not safe. He ignores me, laughing at my fear. (118 words)

I am holding a small naked baby, my hand on his little skinny butt. Charla and Ellie and I are trying to get into a restaurant. Ellie goes in. I try but there is a counter. I try to lay the baby on the counter so I can pull myself over the counter. A man is working there, like a matrie de. He says no, you can't put the baby there. That's not safe. I ask him to hold the baby. He refuses. He's afraid the baby will pee or poop on him. I am also concerned about that. I go back outside. Charla is there. Now Ellie comes up to me and begins to clean my butt. I am sitting. I say, embarrassed, did I poop? She says gently yes. She is cleaning up the mess. I am surprised because I didn't feel anything happen. Now I and Ellie are in a building. Some welfare workers are showing us clippings or video of us trying to get assistance illegally. I feel caught. I see a clip of me wearing a blue with white Pokka dots on it blouse and a small peter pan collar. The pants are a bright floral pattern like yellow daisies on a dark background. I am doing gymnastics stands with Charla. She's on her back with her legs up and I am going to lean on her feet so she can raise me. I hesitate. I am so heavy. My tummy is plump and protrudes.

I am in a house with visitors who are there for some meeting. I am the hostess and am walking around trying to keep everyone happy. I see some pieces of pie on plates and pick one up to take it back to the kitchen. It is a colorless sort of lemon meringue pie, and it falls off the plate. I get a Kleenex and try to wipe it up, and I keep seeing more spots of the pie on the floor like I had stepped in it and walked around leaving sticky footprints or blobs where I stepped. Even though I only had one Kleenex and I am worried it won't be enough to take care of the mess, it keeps becoming more Kleenex and I keep wiping up more messes. Some couple comes by and tells me to cancel their subscription to the counselor newsletter. I say OK but wonder why because it hasn't been up and running for months. Now some meeting is going one. Something important is being discussed. [NOTES: I had the TV on and news coverage was going on about the current crisis.] (173 words)

Dovre and I are at a hotel. We are trying to get breakfast. We walk along a line of long tables. Apparently it is full. But then people are quickly leaving. Now we have plenty of places to sit. We get in line to get our food, only now we're buying books. The man at the counter says OK. Pay me. I look to Dovre. I say Where's my purse? I am concerned. Did she lose it? She says I left it in the car. I question her, concerned about this. Are you sure? When did you do it? Now, I am watching a man and a woman who bought some things. The woman bought 3 dresses, a red one, a green one and a black one. She's asking the man if she should wear these green pull on sleeves in the black dress. He is distracted as he's looking at the lovely faceted jewels and stones he bought. A black agate cut like a diamond. He's showing them to a man. There are also pretty copper objects. The woman wants to wear the red or green dress and doesn't think the green sleeves will work with them. (198 words)

["Mom smiles."] I am in a large living room with lots of people. My father is having a celebration about his "geology" stuff. Lydia and I are acting as hostesses. Someone comes by and is handing out special commemorative T-shirts with printing on them. They are a shirt and pants sweat suit. I am surprised the material is so thin. And the shirt is a hooded sweat shirt with a net covered hole in the front center. I am wondering how to wear it without flashing my breasts. I look down at what I'm wearing and see a skirt with a black pair of pants under it. So I carry the sweat suit around with me. I am trying to gather my stuff up and tuck it away on a wall shelf. A small bag (leather pouch). A girl cousin or niece is cheerfully helping. I notice my mother is standing there, quite stiff and lifeless in the middle of the party. I move her over to the shelf too. I speak to her softly and gently. She does not move or respond. Then I see Lydia staring with concentrated concern looking for something. I hop over hassocks and things to get to her. She was looking for some people who crashed the party. I try to help her find them. I mingle and walk through the crowd. I see my father asleep on his tummy in a bed. I go to wake him as he is the guest of honor and should be up greeting people. I call out to him and he finally opens his eyes sleepily. He doesn't get up but the bed is pushed over to a door to a hallway. I walk past him down the hall which is crowded with piles of clothes and things. I see my mother again. She is more relaxed and a soft smile on her face. She doesn't look at anyone or respond but she is trying to dance. I put her in a small box for now. Then I see the box is rattling around on the top of the furniture it is on. I put my hand on the box to calm it down. She's dancing in there. So I feel empathy and say, "I'll get you out of there." I try but I can't get it open. Now I am back in the main room and see a group of my father's geology friends. I walk to them and try and chat with them (dark haired) to be a good hostess. Then I am distracted by a large group of people leaving the party in a steady stream. I follow them to the door and say 'What's going on?" Just going outside for awhile? They don't really respond to me either. Later I learn from Lydia they were passengers of some ferry ride boat and crashed the party. (480 words)

I am jogging quite a long distance down city streets. I am slim, young and healthy. I am tiring my body out and looking forward to the creative writing I will do after this "mind emptying" meditation while I run. I get to the University and turn right. I find my dorm. I jog down a hall. The doors are very ornate, carved wood and pretty. I find my room. I will it to be a single room. I go in to see I need to clean it up. I will the bath room to be in a different place than it is. I get in the shower still partially clothed and lather up the soap. I spend lots of time rubbing soap all over me. I have shampoo lathered in my hair. I rinse the soap off and start to towel my hair. I realize the shampoo is still there. So I rinse my hair as well. I am very tired. (162 words)

["11:22PM."] I am alone in a space ship, traveling. There is a bumping and a small midget sized male alien comes on board. He and I can't speak each other's language. I see his right hand is injured and bruised. I gently treat it for him. We are cautious of each other but we are curious too. I open out a folding cot from the wall and he gets on it. I want him to be taller. He is thin and now long legged. Humanoid in body shape. I want to change course so I don't bump into his round sphere of a ship and cause damage to both ships. He is worried and doesn't trust me. I gently persuade him to trust me. I show him the photo of my mother, my Charla and my father. (136 words)

["Dream group with no dreams."] I am in a living room. Two couches, one on each opposite wall. At the long end of the room, a set of bleacher seating. The dream group is meeting. Each person takes a turn and speaks or sings. As they do that, I am seated on one of the couches and am distracted by my organizational project of my dreams. I see two metal objects that are thin and long like a saw only the teeth are few and large like a large metal comb. These are dream cassettes. I am glad to see only two are left to put into the computer. I've gotten a lot of work done. Then I see writing and graphics on one of them. This is my father's work, his organizational projects, his fossil work and so on. I admire the cartoon animation frames he drew along the top of the thing. Then I become aware that lots is going on in the dream group. More people than usual. Maybe 20 or so, some I haven't seen for years. Lots of talking stories and singing. I am surprised no one is doing dreams. But it feels right that they need to tell these stories right now. Then one man in the right side of the front row of the bleachers is doing the NPR credits. "This is National Public Radio. Etc." I am surprised. Now I see what might be Darryl lying on the ground. I lie down with him and we roll around together. It is friendly. Some other man is watching and is jealous. (263 words)

I am watching as a large fat man, like the actor in "The King of Queens", befriend a small 5th grade girl. They are very happy with each other. However, they crawl in bed together to sleep after they are done playing. She kisses him good night on the cheek. They kiss each other frequently. I feel uncomfortable about this. It feels like it is borderline incest. Inappropriate. They sleep and the next morning, he decides he needs to leave, because this could become sexual and that isn't appropriate. Neither want to leave and they promise to see each other again soon. (102 words)

["Arabs attack."] I am in a building looking around. I see a large production of some Broadway show being performed. I peek in. It looks very interesting. I want to go in and see the play. As I walk around I am lost. I walk down some flattened stairs like a ramp down several flights. I am now outside and notice there are Arab terrorists rounding up people. The Arabs have machine guns and are killing people. I run back into the building and up the stairs. Now I'm in a room, apparently a medical office room. I am captured. They do not kill me but demand I look through the piles of papers and keep any important things like money, checks and credit cards. I mourn the loss of important medical records for people who needed them. I try and save as many as I can. They threaten me but don't harm me. (152 words)

["Desperate need to be perfect."] I watch a man who is a wonderful singer perform. He is delightful. Full voice, perfect pitch. Everyone likes his work. Then he is done singing, only he can't seem to stop. He now insists we listen as he vocalizes the exact sound of each instrument in the orchestra. He does the "a" note like a violin. A "d" note like a cello. He is very good at it. But people are getting restless. Time to move on to something else. He doesn't want them to go. (87 words)

I feel like I hurt his feelings because I didn't choose to kiss him. We kiss. (73 words)

["Outlaws hiding."] I am part of an outlaw gang. Burt Lancaster is the leader. We are kind of dufus. We are trying to hide until its time to do the heist. We ride horses and go into a crevasse in a rock mountain area. Then we want to signal one of our men. I stick out a big cardboard with a crayon drawing of one of us out there and wiggle it around. A second later, the man on the horse sticks his nose into the crevasse. I must have put the sign right in front of his face. We are worried the sheriff and his men might see. We sneak back to a ranch. A young woman and her mother and father run the ranch. I am now trying to hide some souvenir I bought at a store in a cupboard on their porch. She finds me. I try and hide it. Then there's some contest all the outlaws are trying to win and so I want to try too. Now there is an old hotdog I must bury outside. While there I see a plastic milk jug and try and bury it. Seems the more we try and hide our trail, the more stuff there is to hide! The woman catches on that we are outlaws and seems friendly and helpful. (221 words)

Then I remember they are sisters so it would make sense she gets them. I lie down on a small bed to rest. Then Charla comes in and wants that spot. I go into another room. A small boy grabs up some candy like pills. I quickly take them to check and see if they are OK for him to take. Some are not. I tell Esther. I check my pill stash to see if he took some of mine. Aspirin like drugs. I am concerned. (115 words)

I notice other signs that someone is dismantling my apartment. I am moving out, but I seem to be getting lots of unexpected help. I don't know why. It doesn't feel friendly. I hear knocking. I go to the back door and look through a window. I see an Asian man wanting to come in. I open the door for him and let him in. Then I quickly go to the living room and tell people there I did that so he could be watched. Perhaps he will steal something. Then I get suspicious of the older Asian father who owns the place. I sneak a peek in a drawer and find he's been hiding my writings and art work on envelopes (manila envelopes) in there. I am not happy about this. I gather them up to take them with me. I tell a woman about it. Maybe the older Asian father has a secret crush on me. (192 words)

Carl comes in and Jack Nicholson. I am distressed and hardly notice I am naked in their presence. Jack N. is teasing me. He says how come you can't even come over and cuddle on the couch all night like friends? How come? He tells a slightly sexy joke. I say I don't know why you think I can't enjoy a good sexy joke. See, I can and I will come over on Thursday night and hang out with you. I am hesitant and he is impressed I am willing to do this. Then I begin to cry out for my pills. My body pills, I cry. My- and I can't think of the kind of pill I need to take. I can't remember its name. I begin to convulsively take and chew up big pills desperately. I have a mouth full of pills being chewed up.

I get up and stand in the living room at the window. It comes right at us. At the last second I throw myself on the couch and cover my face. The window smashes miraculously no one is hurt. The wind is ferocious. Then I pick up a puppy and carry it into a small nook room. My father brings my mother in. I sit there and tell her about the funnel cloud and how I dreamt about it. She smiles and talks to me. I am so happy and surprised. I show her the puppy. She says she wondered where I was last night. She had thought "Barb will know where I put my things when I unpack." I say Oh I wish you had awakened me. Then she requests I make some cranberry juice. I do so in a pretty glass tall pitcher. My father is so happy to have her back and so well. She is sitting in a robe in a manual wheelchair. My father pushes her out into the kitchen table. I open a small refridge to put the juice in and see 2 other pitchers with just a small amount in them of cranberry juice. I say OK everybody, drink the leftover juice first. Dwight jokes and my mother suggests I put the full one on the left side in the back. (270 words)

I am in a house. I am preparing for a dream group with relatives. Aunt Naomi is there. I am fixing foods. I am looking forward to working the dreams. I am going to learn much. Now the scene changes and I am walking through a street scene where lots of tourist shops are. A sort of mall of one specialty shop after another. I am looking for a special type of popcorn oil to make yummy popcorn. I am told by a black man where to go to find it. He seems to be linked to doing dreamwork as well. So He won't come with me so I start looking around for a ramp to get to the next level of shops. I need to go around and down and try to get to the outside street. I have trouble finding my way, asking directions as I go. I finally get out on the street. Lots of colorful shops but not the one I want. Then I see I've come around full circle and see the shop, but it is practically right where I had started. If I'd simply backtracked a few steps and turned in a different direction, I'd have had a quick trip to it. I am surprised and annoyed that I was given wrong directions, apparently deliberately.

I notice we are so far back into the cave that any audience across the river couldn't see us or hear us very well. So I move and Lucy comes with me to the open mouth of the cave. I try to read my script pages but can't find my place. So I just start improving lines, from the heart. Now we are back across the river and I see some people up on the outdoor stage preparing to give some awards. I am prepared to go get one. I am called and go up on stage. I am bantering with some other actors as I do that. (140 words)

["Disability and creative writing."] I am at a meeting of disability rights people. I am seated in my wheelchair near the front. I notice a great many more people than usual are attending. A boy sits in my chair with me. I am startled but try and accommodate him. He sits on my left. The chair seems to look like a large leather upholstered chair in a library but on wheels. The crowd swirls around me and I politely move back a bit as it surges around me to get to the front. Lucy and her family walk past me moving out of the room. She says she'll be back soon, but there are things she needs to do for the family right now. I am a bit annoyed, but let it go. Now the crowd quiets down and I see I am at the back in the back row. I realize I usually would be up front, but it seems fine that I just be an observer right now. Now I am holding a long index card box with many cards in it. I am showing someone a fat group in the middle that represent my creative writings. It's a lot. I feel pleased with the amount. I pull out a large manila envelope and pull out a laminated cute colorful picture of a dinosaur. I chuckle at it. I then tell the person that this isn't actually my writings. Someone else did this. I find a couple more cards with projects that aren't mine. I feel a bit nervous that my large group of cards is getting smaller. I can't seem to find one of my own projects in this group. (279 words)

I am on a platform stage talking to a large audience. They seem far away. I am lecturing on the new computer program I spent years creating where now I have 3-D virtual reality companions I've created. I display one that was created to protect me. He's a burley big guy. I tell them of the long hard struggle of lonely years of work to complete this task. Then this audience which is full of employees of a large company are dismissed and we all go to a smaller classroom. I am writing things on the blackboard. My name and the name of the thing I created using physics. Another of my creations, a young immature shy teen girl, is on stage and I talk with her. A man is in the audience. He and I are attracted to each other. I keep my eye on him. A woman gets up and leaves the room. (155 words)

["Haunted house."] I moved to a house and am trying to unpack. There are many rooms. I am upstairs. I go across the hall and into another room. It feels very scary. Some entity is in there. I go back out and down stairs. I try and calm down. I see the front door is blown open a few inches by a heavy wind and dry dead leaves are fluttering into the house. That makes me feel scared too. I shut the door and then see some round scatter rugs piled on a surface. I gather them up to clean up the place. Anastasia comes in. She is going to help me. She picks up some things and takes them upstairs. I find a few more rooms. Anastasia is gone for too long and I get worried. I go upstairs even though I am afraid. I can't find her. I pick up some more things laying around that makes the room appear messy. Now I am having trouble seeing. Like I can't keep or get my eyes open. I struggle. Then I can see and go to the scary room. I step in. It is bare. But I can feel the presence of the spirit. It feels threatening. I can't find Anastasia. Again, I can't get my eyes open and I feel panic. I struggle and manage to open them enough to get out of the room. Then I become aware of hearing the TV and realize I am hearing the Martha Stewart show with a Halloween theme. I know I am in that stage between waking and sleeping. I watch a few images shift and change. Then I wake up, still feeling uneasy and scared. (284 words)

["Everyone dies in the old folks home."] I am on a bark mulch path that is sort of a nursing home place. There are two elder women and two elder men that live there. I either live there or am visiting. I know them well. One woman knows she is dying today and another will be dying soon. I am around the one dying woman. She dies, then I am concerned about the second old woman. Meanwhile one of the elder men whom I affectionately call Mr. Piggy says he is near death. I say this sure is the day for it. He goes to lie down in his room which seems to be on the path, which is hilly going gently up and down. I suggest to someone we move his coffin right into his room so when he dies it will be close by. I watch as they move it in. Then I wonder if that is bad taste. Maybe he will think I am trying to hurry him along. He doesn't seem to mind. Then I go in and he requests one of my chocolate candies. I give it to him. He sighs happily. The other old man is a sort of ancient Gaston. He is thinking he will die soon. We walk along together on the hilly path. We talk about Mr. Piggy. (220 words)

["The spy sandwich."] War is going on and I have in the basement of my home a secret sandwich which somehow is important to the war effort. Actually the sandwich is a sort of camouflage of whatever I am creating. I have a young female roommate. I am in the basement working on the secret project wondering if I should let the military know about it. Can't be the air force because they are the enemy, but maybe the Navy. I am trying to change channels on a weird TV and having trouble seeing what is on each channel. I then look out the window and notice the shallow end of the ocean is practically up against the house. No extra safety space if there is a storm. I see the area really close to the house is sort of a tide pool area. A friend of my roommate is coming to see my project and I try and hide the sandwich. Then Dwight and even Jake comes in. Apparently I've called a family meeting. (172 words)

["Having fun dancing."] I am in a room. A meeting of some kind with Archie. We are talking about dancing and dancability. I go to another room, where some people are doing contact improv. I am enjoying watching them. I join in. The height of my wheelchair keeps going from flat on the floor to knee high, as I use a lever to try and get it to a comfortable level. I dance as I do this. The younger people are impressed I can do so well. I tell them I used to do this a lot. Then Lucy and Mirabelle and others come in. We hug and talk. Then Cindy of MIUSA comes by and asks me to dance for 20 minutes so she can document I did it. I say sorry. I have to return to this meeting. Wish I could. I go back to the meeting where "Archie" is a black man. He meeting seems to be over. We hug. I want to find Cindy and get that documentation done now, but now she's gone too. I feel disappointed.

["Starting over again with my dream program."] I am in a room. I have a desk cluttered with strange objects. A woman comes in. She is there to assist me to work better with my job, which is to get my dream program up and being useful at this company. I've been working on it for a long time. Apparently, I haven't been working on it much lately. I feel the need to begin again. But I am confused what these objects are. Some are organized, some are just laying around. I try and explain to the woman. Someone hands me a broken video cassette. I see it was smashed, maybe run over like by a wheelchair. Maybe mine. The round rolls of tape are out of the cassette. It can't be fixed. I sigh in frustration. I return to my computer area. I realize I will have to start over again to recall what I was doing with my dream program. Now I'm in another room. Some babies are lying on a couch. Tiny newborns. I see one black baby all naked. His color is a sort of grey blue shade of black. It doesn't look healthy. I realize it is very cold and can get sick. These babies are sort of like toys for Charla to play with. I pick up an outfit to clothe the baby with. It is damp. That will only make things worse. So I pick up another outfit. I can't get it on the baby. Someone else finishes the task. Now I am seated and Charla is talking with me. Visitors come to the door. A boy with bleached blonde hair, all cool, comes to ask Charla out. She laughs in embarrassment because she had chocolate or dirt smudged on her many double chins. I then see she looks like Ellie. And Ellie has the same mud or stuff on her face and neck. Apparently they were playing make up or something. Then I see the boy has it too. I offer a couple of different colors of lipstick for Charla to try. Then she and about four teens go out the door. One young female teen has a huge bouffant bee hive hair do. Then all of them are wearing scarves like Muslim women as they walk out the door. (381 words)

["Let me do PE."] I have moved. I am in a new job, a new town. Charles Gibson, ABC news man, is helping me locate a special place to live in. He gives me a paper with an address. They won't be available for awhile, and I am thinking of getting another place temporary and waiting for this wonderful place. Then I am going to school. I am in a locker room waiting to talk with the gym teacher. Class is starting. I see a gym by looking through a large plate glass window to the gym below. Women are playing sports games and exercising and so on. Apparently a committee must meet and decide if I can take the PE class. I am anxious to meet them. Finally the male teacher comes out and introduces himself. He asks me why I'm there. I say because I am afraid that the committee will decide I can't do the PE class because of my disability. He says do you want to do the class? I say yes, very much. He seems friendly and willing. (179 words)

["Whirlwind knocking at my door."] I am in a house and become aware that a large wind storm is approaching. I open the door and look out. A whirlwind is approaching. I shut the door quickly. I walk back across the room away from the door. I stand in the other doorway across from it that goes to another room. The whirlwind slams against the door like it is knocking. I realize with a small bit of concern that I am in the path of the whirlwind and could be hurt if it does break in. I think of moving out of the way, but I don't because I think it won't make it in.

I run up the stairs which has piles of sand on it. The sheep are coming up the stairs at me and the boy. I shove and kick the sand in their faces, trying to slow them down. It works. They turn and go back down the stairs. I was on the verge of rounding a corner to the second flight of stairs but don't have to now. (103 words)

I need to help get her things packed. Then I am seated at a cafeteria table with some teachers. Then Howard is there across from me. I wonder why it's been so long since we've been in relationship, or had sex. I wonder if it will work if we try again. Then my mother is there. The image is like she's lying down but there's no furniture she's on. She gives me an odd cuddly sort of kiss on the cheek. I am glad to see her. She tells me we only have a few more days to get Charla packed and moved. I tell her I've already started on the packing at her house, Charla's room. I'll get on doing the rest now. (150 words)

I am in a woman's house and yet I am also on stage. I am describing to the audience which is not in front of me but off to the right side, that my work with my dream program created yet another wonderful new experience. I have discovered that there are patterns that create beautiful music. I see in front of me a schematic drawing hovering mid air. I see algebraic type formula's with X's and Z's and minus signs all in a 3-d chess kind of setting. When these patterns are played beautiful music happens. I am passionate about it. A man in the audience is worried. He says but how are you going to do all this? You need help. I say I know and I feel sad. I do need help. I don't know if I can get it. Then I am getting ready to go to school. I feel tired and not prepared. (157 words)

I am in a room. Someone is giving me information that is important for me to know. I can't understand it. I step into a tiny part of another room. I lie down on a couch. A friend of mine like Alan Arkin comes and I laugh because he looks like a Native American Eagle Mask and I try and see him under it. He is friendly and concerned for me. I try and explain what I see instead of him. The yellow neck ruff feathers, the white feathers around his brown round golden eyes. Then an old man who is rich and owns the house is seated up on a wall, like in a high chair. Someone views the room and says Oh, there is no furniture here. She can't be living here. I say I have one chair and the couch. Then the message I didn't understand is repeating. Sentences I try to trace with my fingers. Need the pain, something about the pain. I need to figure out what this all means for my own well being. My friend is sympathetic and wants to help. (188 words)

Suddenly the entire brick wall starts falling in on me. I sit there thinking Oh my God, I'm going to die. But somehow it crashes down and nearly hits me but I am safe. I am very surprised. Mitch R. from High School sits with me. He is loving and helpful. We cuddle. I am concerned about the special glass fragile goblets of my Grandmother's. I am worried it was smashed during the fall.

I name all my previous babies, Dovre Jo, no, Jo, Ellie, Paulina, Charla, Amelia, and Damian. I think of the name Christina for the baby. But I definitely don't like that name and say no. I can't come up with a name. I hold my hand under it's tiny butt and see some pee came through. I dump that and get a fresh diaper. (103 words)

["Howard trapped again."] I am hiding in a bed that is like a top bunk. A blanket is used like a curtain. Howard comes into the room. He knows I'm there and comes up in the bed with me. I pretend to be in a coma. He leans up to my face, his cheek on mine. He says I know you are there. You had better reconsider our relationship. I'm not going to stay here forever with you ignoring me like this. I think to myself. It's better off for you if you leave. He is angry. I am determined. Then he leaves the room and I get out of bed. Lydia has a friend that wants to sell me a big storage system for my dream program stuff. I ask how much. She says 1600. I laugh. I haven't got that, but she comes in to do the pitch anyway. I ask her what kind of media she is using. She is impressed I have a video player in my room. It's sort of an office. I say but no monitor to see it with. I use it on my computer, which is in a small separate room off this office. Somewhere in there I help a female client with her problems. (210 words)

["No help to be had."] I am bussing home from California. I have some physical problem and end up on a military ambulance. They are brusque and non helpful. They give me some pills. I see some broken Vicadan pills and attempt to swallow them with applesauce. One gets stuck and I have a hard time swallowing it. Finally I am successful. Now they want me to swallow other pills. I ask what they are. They refuse to tell me. Then they threaten to force them down me if I do not comply. I tell them of my throat condition and how they could kill me if they did that. They are militarily insistent. I decide to leave. I have to walk as they won't assist me and the ambulance in non accessible. I walk slowly with difficulty and struggle down the 2 steps of the vehicle painfully. Then they dump my power wheelchair onto the ground and take off. I am left on a hillside by the side of the road. I see a bus stop and go there. I am trying to figure out where I am. There are shelves with booklets and information on them. I figure out I'm at a college but can't get the name of it. Y College is on one booklet. Finally I see some students. I tell one I am trying to get home and can't figure out where I am. I am stranded. They are concerned and many of them gather around me to hear my story. One woman student suggests I write my adventures down as stories. I say I always do that. I ask for help. They suggest there is a woman who helps out emergency situations. I ask them to contact her. They say no, as it is 11pm and they don't want to disturb her. I am frustrated. All I want to do is go home and I need help to do that. Where will I sleep, how do I get an accessible bus. Which is the right one. Where am I? They say I am at P College. (347 words)

I go outside to look. I walk on a path along the river. The water is still and shallow. I say the water is low as it is California. Hope there will be enough water to put out the fire. I walk on and look into the forest. Someone had gone in there and reports that the fire is coming but it is a long way away. I am concerned and want to prepare to be safe. (118 words)

["I don't listen."] I am in a church. I am a part of a group that are all dressed up in formal wear. We are lined up to walk up to the pulpit and be formally accepted. I am the first one of the group, so the Minister begins to talk to me. He signs my name Barb Sanders on the paper but he totally ignores the others. I feel embarrassed. They are upset. The Minister gets all tongue tied and says half finished sentences and says wrong words that don't make sense. He feels embarrassed because it is awkward, not smooth.. Finally he's done talking and we go sit in the pews. It all feels unfinished. Now I sit next to a man in a lovely cream colored suit. He seems to like me and me him. He's trying to become acquainted. A woman stands up in front to talk. Her mother is embarrassed. The woman has a thick roll of paper with her. Life sized. Then as she lectures, she stands on the chalk tray of the blackboard just behind the Minister's pulpit which faces perpendicular to the audience. She puts the unrolled paper taped to the blackboard. Then she stands against it like she is a living part of it. She swings out toward he audience like turning the page. As she swings back and forth, she is erasing the blackboard itself to where it is see through glass. A couple of men with video cameras go into the room off the church area and film us through the clear glass. As she stands and moves on the chalk tray, it bulges and buckles. She gets down and walks near me. She's going to return up there and I warn her of what I saw. She doesn't heed my warning. Now I'm at home and seated on the couch. The phone rings. It's a dreamer for the Nightmare Hotline. She talks and then I interrupt her and hang up, expecting her to understand she is supposed to call again. She does. And I interrupt her again and hang up. I feel badly. I am doing this wrong. I should explain the procedure to her and listen to her. The phone rings again. He said his name but I didn't hear it. I recognize his voice. He wants us to have a date. He is intense and somehow sad and negative, already worried I won't like him. He wants to go to a swimming spa and sit in the hot water and be close and intimate as we talk. I ask him to give me directions to the spa. He sighs sadly. He can't figure out how to explain the directions. By now I have the feeling he's a "stray kitten." I am losing interest, just as he was afraid I would. (471 words)

["Beautiful interior of house."] I am at a house, maybe Grandma Maude's house. I had stayed overnight. Some family occasion. It's time to pack and return home. I am gathering clothes up from under a bed. I think many of them don't belong to me, maybe they are my sister's. Now I am standing outside of a house, apparently it is my house I am returning to. I stand under a tree looking at the house. I am curious what it looks like to other people. I see a flat front with chipped paint a baize color. I see the side where it is very long and apparently five stories high. I am surprised there are several more floors than I remembered. I wonder if someone else lives in that part. Then I remember it is all mine. Now I am curious and want to see the other floors to see what I have. I look in the front windows and see wonderfully beautiful glassware and cut crystal bowls sparkling in the sunlight. There are many beautiful art objects in this house. I really like that. I notice the difference between the unkempt appearance of the outside of the house and thew inner beauty within the house. I then see several children getting out a side window onto a ledge that goes around the house. The babysitters are letting the children out for while. This seems dangerous to me. I step back under the tree so no one sees me. I see them hand the baby to one of the girls. Charla is one of them. The walk along the edge of the ledge, apparently safe. But I am nervous for them. Now I go into the house and walk through rooms. I find a kitchen and see a bathroom utility room to the side on the right. I go in and am amazed a how Sharon had cleaned and fixed it up. Yellow and Black patterned linoleum on the floor. It is spacious. The toilet however is constantly running nearly overflowing. The bowl is full of water. I see it needs to be fixed and a raised seat made for it. I think this will be easy to do. I see another room off this one and go in. A pretty bedroom, a wooden bed diagonally across the room. Several flowered patterns of wall paper. Pretty curtains on the several windows. I call to Charla and say isn't your room on the second floor? She says yes. I say how about this one? She looks it over and agrees it will be a nice bedroom. We decide she will move into it. I want to explore the floors above and see what rooms I have there. I am enjoying the discoveries. (458 words)

I see somehow a cup of water had been knocked over and water is pouring out over the black electronic boxes on the table. I get up, still tired and annoyed. I try to clean it up. Paulina and Caroline are there. We are talking. Now I want to move to another room. I go down a hall. My father and Uncle Willis are walking ahead of me. As they enter a bedroom, my father quickly pulls his pants down. I figured he was changing clothes, so I turn into a bathroom to take a pee. People keep wandering in and out, mostly relatives.

I find some empty cardboard boxes and a woven basket, round. I start to pee in the basket, standing up over it. I quickly pull some Serene wrap onto the bottom of the basket so the pee won't go through. I pee a lot. Then I try and clean up my mess, carrying the basket trying not to spill any. I put away some of the boxes I pulled out to use. (97 words)

It is all precarious and unstable. I am his assistant. A woman student is having problems. I counsel her trying to be supportive and helpful. I work as a counselor in the classroom. Now I am home and in bed, the woman client is in bed with me. She has an injured disabled foot. I am still counseling her. Howard comes in. I explain to him this is my client. He nods at her foot.

["Out of body experience."] I am in bed asleep. I get up and walk into a living room. This place is old and funky like many of my dream places. I see a typewriter with a carbon paper on it sitting on the old couch. There are lots of odd looking machines and machine parts. Dwight has been inventing things again. I go to a black computer monitor and turn it on. I see lots of writing on the screen. I realize I've gone on line and a prepaid telephone card is adding up the charges. I can't remember how to use the computer so I shut it down using Alt and delete keys. Then Dwight's odd machines begin to expand. One is a metal silver cylinder a few feet across and it is growing toward the ceiling. I am concerned it will push through and cause damage. It in fact pushes against the ceiling and bulges it. I hear a loud snap of a 2 x 4 snapping. This doesn't seem safe, so I leave the room and return to my bedroom. I have trouble remembering where it is. I open a door and see myself sleeping in a hospital bed, like my own. I approach myself. I don't look well. I then enter my body and see the blinds on the window and realize my consciousness had transferred back into myself. (229 words)

["Dream workshop."] I am attending a dream workshop. It lasts for days. I sleep in someone's car. The workshop is crowded and I have barely enough room for my wheelchair in the group. I need to go pee and enter a bathroom. It is crowded. I look for accessible toilets. None. Then I see one but an able bodied woman is using it. She points a device and says that's for the disabled. Use that. I look at it. It looks like a weight scale for babies. I say I don't know how to use it. I wait for her to finish. She leaves saying it's broken. I look and see slugs in an old fashioned metal bedpan. I explain to another woman that I can't use the lower toilets because of the damage in my knees. I leave. It is the end of the workshop. I pack. I have several wonderful books on dreams that I bought. I go to the car and the family that owns it are annoyed that I used it. I apologize and take my mess out of there. They drive off. I decide to stay the afternoon enjoying the dream crowd and talk. Then I realize I have no place to sleep. A man allows me to share his single cot. We have to hide me under him. It is cozy and safe. No one finds me. (231 words)

He is having a heart attack. I am trying to get a signature from someone to take over the business. A man is escaping in a car. As he drives down the narrow steep mountain road a white substance appears on the road whenever he uses his brakes. He tries not to use his brakes so he won't be detected, but the road is dangerous, so he must, on the curves. Now my father is getting married and I am the bridesmaid. I wear a pretty long dress. The bride isn't there, but we do the wedding anyway. (131 words)

The clerk insists that the dress is the right size. It is an 18. I say no, I wear a 16 or even a 14. I put it on and show her how loose it is with plenty of room to spare. I take it off. Now I look through the racks and can't find any other dresses to try on. I am also looking for things for Charla. Then Dwight and Jake are there. I say something to Jake who is being non cooperative. A man sitting near him asks him why he isn't being helpful to me. Jake says grumpily if you want to be my friend, don't tell me what to do. I have to return a phone device I bought. I assure Dwight that I will pay for it if I have to so he won't get stuck with the bill, since he put it on his visa card for me. (191 words)

["Where's Dad and sleeping mice."] I return from M City with Charla. I am moving my computer furniture into a bedroom. Placing it so I can see out the window comfortably. I see a pile of plastic stack boxes and look in one that has jelly belly candies in it. I see two fat little mice and think they are dead. I see one stretch so I know they are sleeping. I need to find my father. I walk out of the bedroom up one stairs to another part of this house. I enter a kitchen. Some other family lives there now. The woman has to move the stove for me to get through. Narrow passageway. I go down a hall to the living room. Lots of young adults with babies are sitting or lying on couches and opened couch beds. My father isn't there. I realize he didn't return from M City with us. I ask the people if my mail arrived. They said yes but they can't find where they put it. I am frustrated. I walk back to my bedroom only the passageway from the kitchen is now partially blocked off with a piece of plywood. I squeeze through just barely. Then I see boxes of Jello in plastic containers. One a giant sized box. I decide to buy them. I turn back and ask Jerry E. the store clerk to ring them up. Now I am walking with them and realize they are very heavy. And I wonder what flavors they are. I should have looked first. I chide myself for not thinking of that before I bought them. I am angry at myself for scooping up a bargain before thinking it through and thereby wasting my money. I always do that. Annoyed. (292 words)

For the second night in a row, I dreamed of Jon. He was trying to make an impression on me. He embarrassed me! Then I dreamed that Reta and I saw Blake in a restaurant and we went in and had a coke. Some kids were dancing and I was wishing Blake would ask me. He did. We bopped all over. When it was done, we sat down. He said, "Your hair's messed up." I said, "Oh, dear, not again" (He had his arm around me). He bent to me and said, "Yes-let's mess up a mustache" and then he kissed me. The kiss was so real! Then I dreamed that Nate came home. I met him in S City at the bus depot. He was 6 feet tall and all muscles. He grabbed my hands and then threw his arms around me and kissed me,(All these dreams were when I was fast asleep).

Again, I am in a richly decorated room, a large bed. I am eating very sweet rolls, butterscotch on sweet rolls. I am suspicious of it. A man has been "sent" by another man to make love to me. I am vaguely aware of all this and I'm suspicious. A thought occurs that, "Now it is OK. The sweets are fresh and not poisoned or drugged." The man leaves and the "original" man comes to me. A feeling of being pursued, not frightening. [BL] (83 words)

As I was "waking up" from a nap, Ginny and Rosemary were perched on my bed. Ginny was doing Math. I watched her count columns, carry and write numbers as she figured and I said, "You do math like me." She wasn't doing well. Then I got worried. I said, "Oh Lord, I'm sure that I'm signed up for an intro to German class, but I forgot to go to any classes and it's late in the term. I'll flunk." I started looking through my filing cabinet for the register form. I saw some B'day cards scrunched in there. Rosemary said, "Take those out." I had to see a boy standing on his head trying to say something but no one would listen. It was a B'day card to the devil. He had a grotesque red face, with huge reddish teeth. He was standing very large in a formal striped suit with a tie and carnation and a huge overcoat on. His coarse, snaky tail was draped around him. No fear. [BL] (171 words)

I had the most incredible dream. I was back in the hospital only it was a sort of school. I'd just been informed that I was going to be executed at 9:00 the next morning because I'd not gone to a meeting. I was paralyzed with fear and the enormity of the injustice. My 2 roommates, also condemned, went home for the night to be with friends and family. I didn't have anyone special to go to, so I stayed. Someone (perhaps my alter ego), came to me and said, "Come on, let's fight this. We'll go talk to them. They won't do it." We flew, over a muddy, cold, choppy lake. A lady in a helicopter was who we were to speak to. My friend advised me to speak confusingly, not good to be clear and direct. It didn't work. I was back in my room. The chaplain came in. He brought me a "form 52, a form of protest" to fill out. If I filled it out, they'd have to stop the execution and deliberate. He said, "Sometimes it takes them 'til summer!" [BL] (185 words)

I had another strange dream, about kittens. The 3rd one. This one, I gave birth to 1 dozen kittens for their mother. I called her over.

There was a puppy in this dream too. Strange. What does this symbolize to me? [BL] (73 words)

Back at a place like uni house. The kids and I are going to see the movie "Tell Me that you Love me Junie Moon." We get to the concert hall. I see some friends (blonde woman), and the kids go to sit by them. I look in a side room. A circle of people sitting in chair (regular ones) forming. I chat for a moment and then go to join my kids. I see an empty space behind friends. I must "tightrope" walk a bench (blonde wood). As I almost get there, my "friends" get up and leave like strangers (I had overslept and was late to movie). Now I'm at a house. It's late at night and dark. Fletcher walks in. I say, "Hi." We talk. I say, "So, on your way back to Hawaii?" (He wore a Hawaiian shirt). He is surprised that I know so much about him. Generally he's cool and distant but when I read him right, he really looks at me. He starts to make love to me. He doesn't really care about me or how I feel. He has an orgasm. Then I feel an orgasm coming. He sucks my breasts. They are flabby and old. I am at first embarrassed. Then I don't care. I get in a dominant position and go for an orgasm. I kiss his ear. He is non-responsive. He's like Raul, but skinny like Elliot. [BL] (238 words)

Paul McCartney and my "friends" were on one side of a room, and the Arabs were on the other. A chain link fence was between us but there were gaps in it. Paul started yelling insults and taunts at the Arabs. I said, "Stop it." I stood up and walked to him. The Arabs started yelling back and coming into "our" side of the room to fight. I was in the middle; I made them go back. Paul and the others started up again. I again tried to stop them. One Arab thanked me. Then, they all started again and I gave up. It was too big. I gathered up some things and left the room. Now I was in the hall. I said, "I want to get away, where there's no people." Paul said, "You want to go camping?" I'm not enthused. I want a fireplace, etc. My father said, "You can go somewhere remote, if you can handle traveling over the Texas desert." I ask if we can go where there are no hunters. I don't want to get shot.

Later, I'm being chased by people in 4 helicopters. They are trying to shoot me. I get on top of a green airplane just barely larger than my body. I lay down on it so it and I are the same configuration. I control the speed with my hands on the prop. We fly over a big shiny lake. I look back. Two men run and jump into the lake to escape the helicopter. They land head first in shallow water from the waist to the feet. They are out of the water (standing on their heads) I go over a mountain, calling ahead to get permission of the airport to land quickly. At first they refuse. I have to wait my turn, heavy traffic. I tell them this is an emergency. They say, "O.K., you'll have 10 seconds between planes." I then get inside the plane. I think, "No, I don't want to, I feel trapped," but then I decide to because I would have metal around me and the chair back to stop bullets. I land. Then I'm in a huge house sort of like M City, only there are lots of windows everywhere (like at in-service old club house). I tell people, "Duck down, or you'll get shot." A mixture of people are there. Chuck, Dylan and lots of young college age women. One young woman wants to know what's going to happen to our deal over the yarn if some of us get shot. I am impatient with her. I say, "If I get shot, the yarn's yours, O.K.? The rest we'll worry about later." I go downstairs. Two Seans come in, nonchalantly. [BL] (277 words)

A secret door. I started to go through the back door. 2 men were blocking the way. I shut the door and went through a side secret door. It led to an old abandoned room. Somehow I had made a time change. I was back in pre-historic times, in a cave. I stood near the mouth of the cave and an eerie light (green phosphorous) shone on me. I cast my image out into the night to look scary. It scared the natives. I saw some children swimming from school, raging water. This was ordinary for them. 1 girl had to walk on land the long way around. The clansmen talked about raising the bridge the children walked on so it was above the water in storms so they wouldn't have to swim so dangerously. I met a man, a caveman. I was intelligent and seemed to know things (realized memories from modern times would unconsciously filter through and I would solve problems). Others felt nervous about me, because I was so good at figuring things out. A plane landed on the swimming place. A man got out, and pushed the light craft up to shore so it wouldn't float away.

A vocational rehab counselor was questioning me about my cousin Sonja and her capabilities as a VR counselor in the coast office. I told him that Sonja and I go back as far as birth. She had a few things to learn yet, but she was pretty good. He said he wanted to know more. We got into a car and drove to the M City house. There was some snow on the ground. I suggested that he park in the driveway. I say, "Turn right into the driveway." He obstinately turned left into a bank of dirt and snow. He and I agree that that won't do. He turned the car around and parked on the street, facing the "bad corner." I was concerned but saw another car was parked right on the corner so that we were protected from collision. We go into the house. I took him the full length of the house to the far end. I say, "Let's start at the oldest part." It was a freshly remodeled room, empty of furniture, and freshly painted. I told him how this used to be a half-finished garage. I pointed out where the grape vines used to be. It was now a lovely wall with windows. We moved to the next room, the rec room. I pointed to the door. I said, "It used to be somewhere else. I still can't get used to it being there and it startles me when it opens. It too has been freshly remodeled." As he and I had driven up to the house, I had pointed out the rising creek that was in flood stage. I told him that sometimes the creek came right up to the door and sometimes came in and started to flood the house. [BL] (298 words)

I had some company and they left. I was tired and wanted to sleep. I could sleep sitting up in the van, passenger side, or sleep on the bench seat in the back. Both ways I'd be uncomfortable and cold, so I went to Thea's house and slept in a bed there. They weren't home. I woke up the next day and was getting ready to leave. I came out of the bedroom and found Thea and someone else there. She lectured me about taking advantage of her, using her house without permission, and she asked me if I had used anything else. I was quite annoyed with her. I wanted to leave. It didn't seem polite to leave in the middle of her lecture. She was angry. So was I. I felt guilty and caught but I also felt justified and annoyed. I wished I had chosen to sleep in my cold van. Then, I just decided to leave. I said, "Bye." She was miffed. I was then in a library, borrowing books. The female that was with Thea was also borrowing books. She was jealous of something. I talked to my brother Dwight. [BL] (195 words)

At first, I am concerned because he's an older man and I think maybe he won't feel good, but he's strong and sensual and the experience is very enjoyable. It lasts a long time. There are interruptions. Ginny and her two sons come in and talk to me. We stop making love and I tell her to go away now. She looks hurt and wants to stay. I gently ask her to leave for awhile. Her sons are fighting. Will S tells them how to get along. Then a candle is burning near us. My mother appears and says, "Here, I'll move that, it can burn the wood, or your hair." I say firmly, "Here, give me back the candle," and firmly put it back where I want it. She looks hurt and looks around for something to straighten or fix. She leaves. Will S and I continue.

I get a new angle for my left angle, RA leaves, I jog to build up muscle tone. The Section 8 juice is light cider with a couple teaspoons of Section 9, which is hard cider. I practice hard. At the last day of class, I shoot a perfect bull's eye with a pump rifle and then with a 30-30. I drink twice as much Section 8 as anyone else. Everyone is amazed at my prowess. I'm proud. I wake up with the words "And the light follows." Oh, I just remembered that as I was practicing jogging, I ran past the old house in M City. It had been removed so that there was space and light for a small, cute, cozy apartment for an old lady. As I ran by, I peeked in the windows. There was no kitchen, because someone else did her cooking. I saw a pretty Afghan, multi-colored, and a rocking chair, a single bed, with lots of lovely windows.

I go to a crystal ball reader. He's late so I go into the room to wait. I go peek in the ball. I'm curious. It is clean. I see nothing. I want to though. I sense the reader smiling to himself. I'm not supposed to look into the crystal ball but he knew I'd try. As I leave, I am reading a newsletter. The reader has published my story. He tells of my back history, disease, marriage, and mistaken beliefs, but points out how changed I am now, how good and smart and neat I am. I am embarrassed but also glad. It's about time I get recognized for my positive side. Ginny comes in and mentions I owe a penny here and there on past postage. I am embarrassed and say, "Yes, I meant to pay that but I just put it off. I'll do it." [BL] (148 words)

The stray kittens plead for food. They are very hungry. I feel badly for them. I look in the refrigerator. I find some sugar cakes and some cheese. I am dressing up to go out on a date. It's a conservative outfit, but as soon as I'm out the door, I'll readjust the front and it will be very sexy. There's a bruise on my neck. I have a belt around my neck and then I put it around my waist. My kids watch. I go outside, stairs. I say, "Where's the elevator?" They say, "No problem. You can go up the stairs." I am annoyed. It will be painful. I go up one flight. Then I sit down and say, "No, I'll go in the elevator. These stairs don't go where I want anyway." (they went back doors). I see penguins that live on the stairs. If radio activity gets bad, they die and then we know. Some lie down dead. [BL] (162 words)

I am the piano teacher. My pupil is a young man. We start warm up exercises in duo. We sound great on the scales. It sounds like Beethoven. Co-worker Tyler is in the audience. Bruce is also. They are favorably impressed. I say, "It's time to begin," and then I start to say, "You need to..." Ethan smiles and says, "Aren't I ever gentle?" He says just before I do, "Yes, with gentle people." [BL] (74 words)

It is Friday at 20 of 6. I am packing my briefcase to go home after a long week. I'm standing up. I see Dana coming towards my office. I feel tired and annoyed. I think, "Where's Andrea?," and I realize she's gone home and can't be reached by phone. I see I'm the only one around to help. I sigh. He comes in, sits down and sighs. He tells me how depressed and lonely he is and how he's thinking of suicide again. I resent his clinging to me emotionally. I guess he feels that he gets to talk out of the office. He says that he'll go now and maybe find someone else or maybe kill himself. I really get annoyed now because he's playing a manipulative game. I firmly yell down the hall, "Get back here! I'll work with you for 25 minutes. Quit playing these games! If you continue playing them, I'll wash my hands of you and you can do what you will with your life." He comes back angry at me. He wants sex. I say, "No, I don't want to." He says I'm mean, that I have no feelings and that I don't care for him. I say, "I care for you as a human being. I'll hug you, but that's all." He grabs me hard like he'll never let go. I hug him, truly feeling care for him. Then I release him and send him on his way. I' feeling food! I'd done what I could and left room and energy for me. I said no to a "stray kitten!" [BL] (268 words)

I am in my wheelchair, looking for a place to park near the theatre so I won't have to walk far. It's very crowded and I end up far away. I see an attendant, sort of a mechanic and chew him out because there is no disabled parking. He has an arrogant look on his face. He says, "Are you one of those hippie type trouble makers?" I look at him with some contempt and say, "I am a counselor here at XXX." He is very impressed. He offers to escort me there. As we walk together, arm in arm, he smiles and asks me out. I think, "He's only a mechanic, but it might be fun to go out for awhile." Then I find out that the person that is scheduled to play the Queen in the play can't, and I am to do it. I have an hour before curtain. Marti S tells me to make frowny faces to the sounds people make. We're all sitting at a table. I do so. One woman thinks I'm pretty strange. I'm nervous. I don't even know the story line much less the words! Marti S says, "No problem, you'll do fine," and then goes away. I wait for her but she doesn't return. Howard is the director of the play. I tell him I'm not ready. He says, "Sure you are." He has confidence in me and doesn't do anything to help me. I get a 12 hour extension. I then realize that I have the Queen characterization down very well, I just need to memorize the words. I feel that I can succeed. I wear a black ornate lacy dress and a wig. I am very regal.

It is necessary to study and learn more about femininity. I see a southern talking blonde, helpless type, and she changes into a well-dressed woman with a dark suit, a black picture hat and a red rose. She's beautiful, self-assured, and strong.

I am dancing. I have a very wealthy guardian and this is like a debutante ball. I'm wearing a blue velvet evening gown. The gown and I are very beautiful. I dance first with one good-looking man, then with the next and then with the next. There are 3 that are the best that I am interested in. One is blond. Then two men escort me to a sort of "throne" chair. They simultaneously pour liquids into my champagne glass, the mixture needed to be swirled to make champagne. Outside there is a battle of airplanes and ships. Then the news is that my "father" must be captured or killed to prevent more war. [BL] (114 words)

I'm going to see a movie. I see some chairs downstairs. I follow Juliet down the stairs. The stairs are clogged with coats, large art-type books, and people. I try not to step on the people. We chat as I go by. Then I look for a comfortable chair. I find one in the back. I ask Jock to carry it more forward so I can see better. He does. I find a pitcher of beer in my hand. Someone comments on it as I go by. I notice I don't have glasses. I make a joke and wonder why I have a pitcher (which the person called a vase). After all, I don't drink. Jock has 2 glasses. I say, "Leave it to you to think of the glasses." I ask his help in setting up the chair. It's just a bit too big for the small space and tips over the stair edge when I try to sit. I see wheelchair tires next to the stair edge that the feet of my chair are resting on. Jock says, "You know, I usually hold you back until you get all the facts (when he's giving me a client). I'm a little surprised and annoyed. He then is surprised at me and says, "I misunderstood you. I thought, you know, you said about alcohol and drugs and those guys you'd pick up on and I thought you didn't like people like that and wouldn't be good at helping them, so I didn't send any of them to you." I am surprised. [BL] (261 words)

A mentally retarded boy was the next act in a show. It had been smooth until he came on. He faltered on the first note and then couldn't get his bearings. I tried to help him out. If he could just calm down and remember the starting point, he'd be O.K. I was seated in a balcony seat that was very close to him. Then I started coughing and he was on his own. It was no good. The show ended ragged and unfinished when it had started so well. [BL] (90 words)

Mabel and I are trying to put together a puzzle. We pick pretty beads from a basket and place them where they belong. I think Shea was there too. Later, I take some kids to the store. A couple of teens take some candy. I tell them to put it back. Then I see Paulina scooting out the door quickly. I run after her and stop her. She has candy in her mouth! I say, "How dare you! Take it back at once! I'll lose respect and love for you." I am very angry, and she goes back. She and I go to the clerk. I say, "She took this candy." The clerk shrugs and says, "Oh well, teens do that." A man walks up to me and puts a soda bottle on the counter. He says, "You pay for it and I'll reimburse you later." I am so busy with Paulina I don't really attend and agree. Then I turn to see who this is. I know him well and I laughingly agree to do so. [BL] (177 words)

I am visiting someone, I think Thea. I'm on the porch. The neighbors are around. A woman is talking. She says she's the land lady of a place up the street. There is a young couple that can't afford the rent. She's willing to cut the rent in half if others are willing to help raise the rest of the money. They ask me to donate. I hem and hah and finally agree to chip in 1 dollar. My daughter Dovre agrees to add some change. Then the girls go out to collect more money. We take it and some food to a gathering. I am thinking, "Maybe I'll keep my dollar since it was my girls that raised the money," but I feel shamed and cheap and leave it in. At the gathering, there are lots of people. A principal of the school asks me to compare my daughter's school with my own. I say, "There's not much to compare. There was the 1950's and now there's the 1980's but they are blended together. They are the same in many ways!" It's time to leave, I can't find my shoes, or the bowl the fruit came in. Then we find both. Out in the street, a strange looking midget walks by. As I go into a house, I hear Dovre calling for her dad piteously like he's drunk and lost in the neighborhood. [BL] (234 words)

He's scared. He throws himself face forward on the ground to protect himself. She is upset and angry because all she's got to contact is his back. She goes away. Eric sits up. There are tears in his eyes. He needs my support. He reaches over and envelopes me in a hug. The woman is crying too. She feels rejected. She's trying to pull Eric off me so she can be hugged by me. I tell her to wait. I say, "I know you feel badly and I want to help, but you have to understand. Eric's blind. You scared him. He needs me more." [BL] (141 words)

The girls and I are going swimming. I get in the shallow end and dog paddle around gingerly. Then I feel challenged to swim with long strokes out to the deeper area. I do so somewhat hesitantly. I stay near the pool edge and Dovre stays by to rescue me if necessary. We get out of the pool/lake. It's fairly crowded. We start to walk down the street. I have trouble walking because my both legs are in one pant leg, like in my mermaid suit. I kind of shuffle, hop along. Then it changes to normal and I walk. I notice a Christmas parade is coming down the street. It's colorful and noisy. We stop to watch it go by. My grandparents (Agnes & Clyde) are there and so is Aunt Esther. The parade is sort of happening through their living room. There are lovely, yellow, lemon-smelling candles. She sure has a lot of candles; her kids must be at that age. Grandma Agnes quarrels about a duck bowl. Rochelle is sitting on a piece of furniture doing a commercial. Half-way through, she runs out of things to day and hops down. I am annoyed at her. She finds a book and asks me to explain it to her. I start teaching about saying yes to a scene and not giving up. She seems to be interested. [BL] (228 words)

Then I realize the bad guy neighbor is on his way to visit me and I don't want him to know about my new relationship. I "see" him coming down the road. He's riding in some open air vehicle and has crows that talk. He sends one on ahead to give me the message that he's coming to visit. I hurry to get my friend out. I leave a message that I've gone to a small family birthday party at my brother's house next door and he can drop in if he wishes. I hope my good friend doesn't decide to drop by too.

They had heard somehow about me needing the medicine and got it for me. A most fortuitous meeting. We chat. They are on their way to a vacation.

She says "It's so hard to grow up," and I sigh, "I sure know what you mean." Then I put her down and we singing leaders march around singing. We stop. A black church group across the street teases us. The minister looks at our sexy evening dresses and yells, "What are you trying to do, make us throw a "mock" fit?"

She assures me she's o.k. I put my hand down there and push the button myself secretly. Then the baby and I must escape. We hide in the movie crowd.

He is hurt and annoyed, but pleading. He caresses my eyelids lovingly. He tells me he was upset that I would question his choices of clerk in front of Dovre who would go to his home and tell.

I see a dirt road and squeal on to it quickly. I hide in the trees. I see them slow up and look for me. I see a cotton men's plaid shirt tacked to a tree. They leave, I escape in a roll of dust. Now I am swimming in a terribly treacherous white water river. I barely make it after crashing over a water fall. I creep up over the bank to safety. I go back to the prison and sneak down the stairs hoping no one sees me. I see chickens in the cells. I make it to the front office and bravely walk straight for the front door. No one stops me. I stop myself and ask them if they remember me. The guard resting on a bunk is surprised. So is the woman clerk. I hear the news that if I don't qualify for a boxing match by 3:00 that day, I'll be locked up forever. I am trapped. I get on my knees and beg the guard to take the necessary papers over so I can qualify in proxy. I weep passionately. He relents and goes. Then a pox from mice sweeps the prison and all the inmates turn to shorn sheep. If I can't get out in time for the match, I'm doomed. One of the sheep baaing notices I haven't changed.

I am a maid of honor at a wedding. The colors are black and white. A black curvaceous 1950's dress and long white veil. I walk up the aisle and notice the groom isn't there. He then enters from a side door. Part of the ceremony is for the groom to describe the future. He's a little embarrassed. He takes his ribbons and artfully waves them around and tells how they will be married for a number of years and then he'll fall in love with another woman and leave. He shrugs his shoulders and looks sheepish. He asks her if she's willing to continue, knowing that. She says yes. The bouquets are black flowers and ribbons. The next step of the ceremony is for everyone to light a small candle and, while singing, put their flame into the common or larger flame of the bride. I light my candle and follow the bride, singing, realizing with embarrassment that the song is "Rashneeshee" and my parents are probably shocked. I like the symbolism of all our little lights coming together in one large light. I drip my candle wax in the bowl. She smiles and points out it made a crooked pattern. [BL] (202 words)

Even though it is hard for me, I pat her arm and permit the affectionate embrace. Even as I relax into the niceness of it, my mother's head slips down and down and I become aware that she intends to have oral sex with me. I am frozen with shock. She starts and I push her head gently away. Ellie comes into the room and starts talking to me. With immense relief, my mother is gone. I look up above my head on the way and see shoes and purses and lots of things precariously perched and ready to tumble down on me. I ask Ellie to help move some of the things.

He suggests we join the others in the boat. He and I get in a row boat with a small motor on it. I ask, "Are we going further out?" He says, "No. We're just going around the corner." We go around and head for a narrow cement chute that was filled with sand, not water. We slide down fast. I'm in the front. The front crashes on the cement barrier and curls the front of the boat up. This has improved the boat's capabilities. We get out and return to the house. Lots of people are there. Patricia is there with the Mexican Tony. They are kissing.

I am a little embarrassed and say, "I suppose it's corny, but it was my last chance to say it to them." We go inside the house. My Uncle Joel calls me to the other room. I am hesitant because I'd already put my stuff in a bedroom. I go into the living room and sit on a couch. Leroy is there and there is instant attraction and warmth. He sits next to me, very close, and puts his arm around me. I know this is wrong, but I want it. I struggle with my conscience a little, but it's a foregone conclusion. He complains bitterly how he never measures up to his father's expectations. A stray kitten and a cousin. It's a double reason to stay away, but I love being near him. I feel warmth and excitement.

I feel somewhat embarrassed and want to explain to her that I mean no harm. I'm not trying to take her husband away. I don't say anything. Then I get up and walk over to my "date." It's Pat Brown. He's wearing a sweater that had been cut in a semi-circle and his chest skin was cut too. He remarked it had been dome by a chainsaw and it sure hurt! He repeated a groaning "Ow!" several times! He seemed surprised at his stupidity of letting himself get cut. [BL] (122 words)

I am maybe in a hospital setting. There are helpless, newborn babies being badly taken care of. Michael J. Fox grabs my hand and pulls me, running through the corridors. I am concerned because I am hooked up to the babies and our running is pulling out their life support system and causing them pain and then death. I feel I must do something. It is suggested that I talk with the top authority, Governor Goldsmith. I waver and think, "Oh, I'll just mention it to some local person. The message comes clearly! "DO NOT WAVER! Go to the top. Top priority! You must save the babies because horrible things are being done to them! They are used for experiments. Pieces are taken out of them before they are dead and people say they can't feel pain but they can! You must help them!" I must help them! Also a naked man was in the bed next to me. [BL] (159 words)

Later a dream about finishing drinking something I had left. Some women are spies and were chosen for a series of features, one of which is they had a miniature silver shoe. I saw a lot of miniature desks lined up. They belonged to Cherry T. I opened one drawer and saw a diary book, about joy. I apologized for looking at her private material. [BL] (65 words)

I am swimming in calm waters and doing very well. I swim toward a rock at the deep end. As I near the rock, I realize I'm getting tired out and need to hang on. I reach for the rock and become aware of evil things lurking under the rock. I slide around the rock and discover I'm in the rough ocean side and feel like I might not make it. I struggle and finally get back to the calm waters and feel safer. [BL] (84 words)

I am looking at images of what went wrong in our marriage. Lots of snapshots, interviews; I remember the color black. I am helping my bad ex-husband set up a shower. It's a lot of tall, ungainly pipes. Between us we get it set up and the cold water pours out of the shower head. I take a cold, cold shower. I am fully clothed and find a small sample bottle of shampoo in my shirt pocket. I wash my hair and arms. I feel very invigorated by the shower because it is so cold. I step out and walk jauntily past my ex-husband and all the pictures. A voice (maybe my brother, Jake) says, "Now, do me a favor. Give him the shampoo. You can work together a little bit." I realize I had selfishly kept the bottle, which had only cost 75 cents. I gave it to him. [BL] (150 words)

A young girl has rheumatoid arthritis. Some people are trying to explain things to her to help her. I am crying. A nice man is going to help her. I think I am worried they can't and don't want to stir up her hopes. The man and I go into his familiar formal room. He tells me to look into a mirror with a heavy, gilded frame. I look and at first I can't see anything. Then I see me, sad, seated and a man (him). I, a happy, healthy me, stand between them trying to explain something. [BL] (98 words)

Lucy is driving my car. I am giving her directions, like backup. "Go straight. Stop now! You've only got another foot to a slight drop off." I couldn't imagine why I just didn't do the driving. It would be easier and safer. Jake is in the pickup as well. We are in a parking lot. We park and get out. Jake is being very apologetic and I say, "Don't over help." They go ahead and I try to catch up. I call out, "Sandy." I'm in an intersection. A crowd is gathering. There is some ceremony where money is being given to a disability cause. I see Lucy and Jake and then I am crowded in by many, many tall men. I look around and exclaim, "So tall! It's not fair!" They can see well. I'm all smashed up against some guy's beige polyester suit. Cameras are everywhere. They can't see me I'm so crowded in. Some man says,"Where do we donate?" And a man says, "It's already been done." The money's here already and I notice I'm standing right at the center of the attention where a round baseball is. The crowd has suddenly thinned out. The cameras are gone. The excitement is over.

Lucy sits next to me at a restaurant, long table. She announces that she is naked under her blanket. She just didn't feel like wearing clothes. We are tasting food. The wife of the restaurant owner wants our opinion. I want to leave and go home. The "games" there are uncomfortable. First I'm going to shampoo my hair. I am in a room and a man watches. I use too much shampoo and spill it into a small container. Now Elizabeth Taylor is taking a bath. A man in a leather jacket comes in, opening 3 wallets with credit cards and money. He says, "This is what I offer. All you have to give is you." I'm a little disgusted and want Elizabeth to leave but she doesn't want to. So I leave. [BL] (133 words)

I am in a wheelchair. Someone says, "Let's go downstairs and make fresh bread." I pull my chair around me like a deflated flotation device. I call Michael over. He's driving a two-seater with a small truck bed behind it, quite fancy. I ask him if he were to get a set of tools, which ones would he get? I don't want him to know I'm thinking of getting him some tools as a gift. A man calls us over. He's upset we're all in chairs, or maybe I'm thinking he might be upset. He says, "Well, for instance, what if I was black instead of white?" Lucy says it wouldn't make any difference to her. She's blind. [BL] (118 words)

Some woman is annoyed with me because she gave me some information and I didn't get it back to her. I agree to get it for her. I get the papers and remember I was going to xerox it first -- it's a lot of information on music. I take it to a xerox machine. An office worker wants to know if I've been watching Hank because he has refused to make a copy of what he was supposed to copy. I say, "No, I haven't." Hank walks in and I say, "Hi Hank," to alert the other woman not to talk about him. I try to xerox. It is hard. There is a lot to copy. I ask Jock to help me. He does. Then I have to go to my dorm room to get more knitted clothes that belong to the woman. We pass a busy military-like man who has helicopter-like machine displays. Get to my room and Jock/Abner gets the clothes, sometimes getting my own clothes almost mixed up with the others. I look up at the ceiling and say, "What happened to my ceiling?" It has ribbon bows on it and the asbestos is on it. It's a mess. Someone explains, but I don't remember the reason. [BL] (211 words)

I am at Thea's house and can't get what I want. Someone tells me that Howard has died. I think, "Oh, so young. Only 44 years old." I feel sad and know it will be sadder over the next few days. I go to get my car, which is broken. There are two, a van and a spiffy car. I think, "I can't use the car because my chair won't fit in." The mechanic is busy and tells me he can't fix it yet and gives me a reason. I tell him I need it because Howard died and that is a stronger reason. He doesn't care. I then remember there will be an inheritanc, but I will have to fight for it. I think, "I'll use the inheritance to get a degree in psychology, another two years of school." I sit in a chair like the swim lift chair and want it to go forward, but someone set the brakes and it tries to go forward like a train (chug chug chug chug) and folds over itself and is broken.

I go to find Lucy. I knock at her door. One of her children calls, "Come in." I see that most of the furniture is moved out. I ask if Lucy is here. "She's in the kitchen." So I walk to the kitchen and look out the back window and see her grooming her horse. I remember she loved that horse and must be feeling sad to leave it. A phone rings and she tells one of the kids to be sure and answer it. I realize that I will be able to talk to her if she comes in to get the phone. I walk toward the phone in the living room. Lucy comes in,; she is naked. She gets up on the wooden rickety table (the only furniture left) and undoes the lamp fixture in the ceiling. There are lots of cobwebs. She tells the girls to be careful of the strings. I say, "I know you're busy, but could you tell me, in a nutshell, what made you do this? Just a few months ago, you were not going to have him and now you're gone." [BL] (189 words)

I am looking for my purse. So is Merle. I find it. I'm going upstairs to have lunch. I am run over and lay on the ground. A doctor comes over and says, "Don't move," and sticks pins in me. I realize I don't feel them. I say, "Oh no! Don't tell me it's my spine." He says, "Maybe not. Sometimes things are numb for a while." The man that ran over me comes to the emergency room as I'm being wheeled in on a stretcher. He says, "I was drunk." I am furious and scream at him that he ought to be hung up by his balls upside down for 100 years. That would teach him a lesson. I am livid. His father says, "We'll talk about this when you calm down." I then have to walk slowly up some difficult stairs to the emergency room. They see me and come running to help me up the last stair. A black woman is there and the nurse jokes about her color being a permanent tan. The black woman says someday people won't be afraid and will treat me normally. [BL] (190 words)

I am taking the wet clothes off a baby. She is lying on a bed and is a mess. I look for a clean shirt and find several. I choose one that's lacy and pretty, but hard to get on her. We struggle getting her hand in the arm and finally succeed. Then I take off her messy diaper and clean her up. She shits when I don't have a diaper on her. I clean that up, shuddering. Now my mother says, "Give the baby to me and you count all this money on my bed." I see piles and piles of coins (change). Most of them are foreign currency. What a tiring task. I say, "I'd rather hold the baby. I haven't had a chance to." She says, "Later, you can do it later." I sigh and start working on the money. Then I'm helping a woman pack. There are lots of snap shots laid out on the bed, some of Willie, some of her lover. I am concerned that her husband will come in and find out! I try to gather them up. Then I must hurry and I choose the shoes to pack, discarding several "Baby Jane" shoes for little girls. [BL] (204 words)

He follows. I see Merle in a shopping cart. I tell him, "This boy came up and kissed me." Merle is a little jealous. I go back into the store looking for a guy. As I'm ready to leave, I find Raul and another guy. We walk out with Merle and Ginny and some others. I say to Raul, "Don't be like you were before; be natural and real." He agrees. Someone says, "To whose couch do we go?" I offer my house. We go to a campground. Raul says he's read about Emily Dickinson. I say, "Yeah, me too. She's into natural drugs." Some people take the campsite we were headed for. We get into a van and drive up a freeway exit the wrong way and cut across wooded area to park next to the original campsite. Ginny has money in her hand. I say, "There isn't any wood for the fire," and then I see some split logs and sticks. [BL] (204 words)

I'm going to teach a lecture on forest fires to a 3rd (4th is crossed out) grade class. I am practicing the lecture with their teacher. I am apologizing that I don't have much content information. I go to the library to find an encyclopedia to get more information. I'm going to show maps and talk about how the fires burn off all the old tangled growth that leaves room for new growth. Then, as we are going to the classroom, the thing shifts and we are now going to a cafe, De Frisco's, to reminisce on the Germany Trip with 3 or 4 other women. We sit around a table. I suggest another member of the Germany group show her pictures. But just before she starts, I pull mine out and start with the Palace of Versailles. I find as I start talking, I have lots to say and it is interesting to the others. Then we decide to play baseball. I hit a ball and run for first base and was nearly "put out." The base was real close. Then I show someone a lovely wooden panel I was allowed to bring back from Paris. It fit on top of a piano we had here. Then we had to move a table that had pretty things on it back to make more room for second base. The table leg slipped and some things fell. We decided we'd meet again to finish our talks as we'd already been there 4 hours. I wrote the names of the ones who will speak and in what order. I consulted with Rena who said she would do her talk if she'd had enough to drink. [BL] (283 words)

I am in a house and it is crowded with lots of things and furniture. A small bird and a large blow fly come rushing in. I think it's a bee but someone reassures me it's a fly. There is a mask in a basket with a lid. I give it to a small boy and he takes it outside and dumps the old, musty, moldy mask. I feel relief. Suddenly the house is nearly empty. Lots of space. Only a stove moved in from a rental (our original old stove) and a table are left and I like it this way. The boy brings back the empty basket and I almost accept it back, but change my mind and give him the basket. I don't want it because it carries the odor and feel of the mask. I am outside. Two guys are up a telephone pole fixing the lines. They are hanging up there in a way that seems impossible, but they seem comfortable. One is there to "spot" the other guy in case he gets in trouble. They finish and come down the ladder and efficiently pack up their equipment. It was very graceful; each knew how to do each task and they just did whatever was closest at hand. I ride my wheelchair around their truck watching them and then I go to my front door and park the chair and walk in. [BL] (237 words)

I finally drive in the gas pump line and get gas. I then start to drive to C City but must get out of the car because of a group of people parading down the street. Chuck is in the parade. A male friend calls out, "You owe me a quarter." I search my pockets and only find a nickel. Chuck digs up a quarter. I say, "Well then now, I owe you a quarter." I start to walk to C City. Aunt Bridget and her daughter walk with me a short way. I think,"I hope I can make it." My knees have really been hurting. I then walk up and crawl up a stairway.

I start to join another woman dancing alone, but then chose to dance alone. Then this man and I discuss what kind of relationship to experiment with. He says "good friend and boyfriend first."

Lucy needs a lawyer. Michael J. Fox (Darryl) takes on the job. He and I are crossing a huge river on a bridge. I see a prehistoric rhino go into the river. "Nice neighborhood," I say sarcastically. The bridge becomes a stairway in a high-rise office building. At first we are going down to leave the building, but then we change and are going up to get to the protection of his father's office. I am glad because then our relationship has a chance. The furniture is rich and lovely. We sit in the dining room. Later, a secretary shows us where the spare blankets and rollaway bed is, only now we're stuck with her. She has three pink poodles, one a male. We laugh at how silly they look! Then, there's a whole crowd of people with us. I remember the lights are on and maybe someone outside has noticed and will come rescue us. I am embarrassed that I'd not thought to flash the lights to signal for help (I am aware I really didn't want help). The elevator now starts to work, but breaks down again.

You'll cover it up." I am concerned. I decide to go home. She gives me the tape of our session and says, "Don't work on this tonight. You've worked hard enough today." I say "OK. Maybe I'll just listen to it once." I smile because I realize I still intend to work on it. Then I look around for my car. I can't see it anywhere.

I agree and ask her to do me a favor. I say when I slip back into my long-winded style, would she lean over and whisper, "You're doing it again." Then I can continue to do better. [BL] (66 words)

Dolores M is trying on some clothes at a store. I see that the hooks to hang the clothes are way up high too high to reach. They follow the slope of the stairs. I say, "That's silly. Why did they do it that way?" Dolores has very heavy makeup on her face. She's here to interpret for the deaf. As I am standing, talking to her, two or three men of color, one black, one or two Native Americans, crowd around me very close. The black man is softly kissing my neck from behind. The Native American man is to my right, talking softly. Another stands some distance from us, but he and I are talking with our eyes and occasionally words. Now I'm seated in the front row. A show of some kind (fashion perhaps) will soon begin. I see a baby and ask to hold it. His blankets are all wrinkled up, so I lay him down on the floor to straighten the blanket up. I end up with the baby in a metal box that cramps the baby's legs up. I hold the baby to my chest and am concerned if it can breathe because the metal lid has closed. I open it some and say, "Boy, this baby sure doesn't like this!" I feel a little sorry I'd gotten it in this predicament. [BL] (228 words)

I am getting out of my wheelchair to go into the bathroom. I start to do a dance and although I move slowly and with some pain, it feels good to do these dance movements. I go into the bathroom and I see a pretty village scene when I look down into the toilet. I am talking to someone just outside the door. I am looking up my brother Dwight's telephone number in my blue address book, but I can't find it. I see: Corinne 470, Lydia 475, A.S, Halloween 472, Kesi, Keshi, Kassee. There were other words and numbers. I laugh at Lydia and I'm nostalgic about the Halloween event. [BL] (111 words)

Someone looked at my hair and said, "Do you like it?" I said, "Oh yes. It's soft and pretty. I like my hair." There was a feeling that my hair looked bad in that it wasn't "properly" fixed by culture standards, but it was surprising that I accepted and liked me as I was. [BL] (54 words)

A girl is being noisy and interrupting. I get into a power play with her. I insist she be quiet and polite and I shake her. I put her in a high box. She starts goofing off and I insist she sit on the outside lip of the box so I can keep an eye on her. Then later I swim alone in the pool, relieved to have a few moments of quiet time.

I'm in an auditorium. Susie S is concerned at her part in this disability awareness spoof we are preparing. I ask, "Why not do it? Lots of AB's represent us in a patronizing way. Why shouldn't we represent ourselves in a good, funny way?" I watch the video we all made. It is funny. I try to sit on a folding chair. Some guy in front talks to me. Merle is in the audience somewhere. [BL] (75 words)

I am organizing things: putting birthday cards I'd received where they can be displayed better so I can see them. Then I go downstairs and We and my mother play 'wait til you see his new girlfriend' (Jake/Nate's cousin). I go to the kitchen door and she's there looking pouty and cute. "Where's Whoopie?" she lisps. I laugh and look in at my mother and Lydia. "She's here," I giggle. "Is Whoopie anywhere?" I accept her way of lisping. My mother whispers to me, "Be careful! She's powerful." I laugh and lead her upstairs to find "Whoopie." She follows arrogantly, telling where she'll put her things. She looks older now, maybe 50, 55. Then Jake runs past saying hurriedly, "It's almost time for the Royal." We all run after him. Now we're like in India and the royal procession is approaching and we must be at our appointed place in time before the King arrives. One man calls our "Elephant" and doesn't even stop running as he hops up on a running elephant. He sways as he rides. We arrive at the stairs and are nearly too late. But protocol says that pushy women must go first. "Hurry! You first," says Jake. She just grins and refuses. "Now we're in trouble! If she won't go, we can't go and then the King will be upset!" I say, "Let me talk to her!" Jake says, "No, I'll take care of it." He pulls out his penis and twists it so that a hand rolled cigarette comes out of the end of his penis! He's going to sit and smoke it until he thinks of a solution. I am a little disgusted at the idea of putting it in his mouth as it will be a little slimy from the sperm! [BL] (299 words)

Terence (my cousin) is dying. But before he can die, he must remember his memories. I am helping him. His eyes flutter and I think he's going, and then he wakes up and tells me more memories. He especially focuses on one weekend we shared together, something about the M City house. He says it was this room before it was remodeled and I look and realize it was the original room. He'd made a mistake. It was the old pool table room, only empty of furniture. [BL] (87 words)

I am sexually excited and want to make love, but no one is around. So I decide to wait for Howard to return. It's been a long time since I've made love to him and it will please him. I feel a little uncomfortable about such a gift because I may be opening myself up to more sexual advances from him than I'll want. So I sit and wait. [BL] (69 words)

I am showing a story book to someone and explaining that even before you start reading the book, the story is there in the symbols.

Jake is embarrassed for me and asks if I'm not embarrassed because I was fired. I say no, because I wasn't fired. It wasn't a real mistake. It was a paper and pencil mistake at the bank. Maybe I did send it in just a little late, but that's not a mistake. [BL] (52 words)

I go through a huge store to the back room. I'm tired and lie down on a bed. Suddenly I wake up to discover John (a man I work with) has crawled into bed with me, and he's naked. I pull the covers up around me and say, "What are you doing?" He's shy but insistent. He wants to make love, to get closer to me. He tries to kiss me. I am annoyed. I certainly don't want to make love to this wimp; what nerve! I say, "No. We can't. I'm your supervisor and it isn't ethical." I then think he'll be hurt, so I say, "I admire your courage to get naked and come here asking, but I don't want this." Just then through an open window I see people leaning out of their windows in the hotel across the street yelling, "Happy New Year" and blowing horns. I look at the clock and, sure enough, it's a few minutes past 12. [BL] (164 words)

I am a teenager and some guy is joining us, but I don't trust him. Our teacher, Gary, calls us together and asks us, "What do you think of this new guy? Does he seem a little sleazy or not "true" to you?" "Yeah!" we agreed. I say, "He doesn't feel right, like he lies." "Yeah," says Gary. "Well, what if I just flat out say, 'No booze or drugs'? That would take care of the scotch problem right there. It's tough, but real." We agreed. Paulina says, "But he might have a problem getting back in with his friends. If he's a flirt, then he won't fit in any more." I think it's interesting that a lesbian is concerned that a drunk be able to continue his noisy, flirty, sexist ways. I disagree and start talking about if his attitude is OK, he can fit in and still have fun even if he's off the booze and drugs. As I'm talking, suddenly little lights zip up to me and surround me. I look up at Gary startled. I realize these are aliens that are taking me away, and as I start rising (still in cross-legged, seated position), I yell, "Gary!" And then I yell, Goodbye!" I see them all staring at me in astonishment and sadness. I feel a little scared and sad as I see the tree as I rise up and up. (I suddenly wake up relieved I wasn't disappearing into the cosmos.)

Bonnie waits for me in the car. I go out and he's out there. I see a turtle with a leather coat over his shell. The man says, "May I have that?" He really wants it. I agree. We circle it and it starts coming closer to me. I back up into the comfortable arms of the man. The turtle comes very close and bites me. I see a tiny bloodless paper cut and say, "Ouch!

I'm in a small room that has dirt and debris and bugs in it. I see a tiny (Alice in Wonderland) door and, curious, I open it. I see an ugly man there and say, "Uh oh, guess I shouldn't have opened the door." I shut it quickly. I decide I don't want this room to be so bad, so I marshal my forces and change things. (I am aware I'm dreaming) and command the bugs to straighten things up. They march around in lines and I walk carefully so as not to smash any of them. I am repelled by them and grateful to them. They do miraculous work. In fact it is lovely and has opened up into more rooms, including the room the man had been in. I go down a hallway toward the bedrooms. I see video games. Then I see a 3-D video behind glass of real people enacting ordinary human activities. I'm like a voyager watching them. I feel sad that I'm reduced to such a lowly act. I see sexual activity and feel an orgasm. [BL] (182 words)

I laugh and say, "Some forest!" There is one tree left. All the rest have been chopped down. I see two people seated under the water. I wonder how they can breathe. One rises up and starts approaching me. I get scared because this is a "siren," a spirit that wants to lure me away. She starts to bite on my ankle. I move so that she ends up biting the base of the ancient tree. If I'd let her bite me, I'd have been a goner. She hovers near and keeps trying. I must focus my energies on keeping away from her. I see a single line of ancient trees stretched out in front of me (in single file), the last remains of a huge and lush forest. The land is totally barren. I must walk across the cut branches (stumps) to get to safety. The water roils and seems threatening. [BL] (188 words)

I am now returning to the acting class. I go too far down the hall to a room where ritzy, well-dressed people are. I back track and find the room. The woman teacher is there and I ask her if she would mind if I could be an assistant director. She says, "How will this help?" I start counting on my fingers how it would help. "First, for me," I say and I pause and repeat it because it felt selfish to say for me first. But I decide it is proper and I say, "For me, I would gain skills and experience. For you, after I learn blocking, I could run some of the rehearsals and you could have time off." "I'll have to ask the class," she says. I agree and point out one woman will say no. She doesn't like me. So I tell the class how I've married this Protestant. They ask if my father is angry. I say, "No because I divorced my Catholic family." Then a woman sadly says, "At first, he won't read your letters and then later, when he dies, he'll speak of you in his last words." She cries. "It was like that with her dad," someone says.

I imagine they would all politely clap their hands after I accomplished my task, saying in cool, clipped accents, "That's nice B." The guy and I laugh at the silliness of their British audience routine. I say, "I'll do it in the swimming pool." Hasani says, "It's too cold." I say, "I only have to do it for three minutes.

So I go into a bathroom and sit on a toilet and pee, and then I walk out to him and hug him, kissing him passionately and say, "Yes." He is so happy and we walk arm in arm, really connected and in love. We pass Jake and Valerie all dressed up and walking together, Jake's arm around Valerie. We are at the Hilton. I smile at them, but they don't respond. I say to my guy, "Maybe she didn't recognize me because I'm standing." She then comes back and says, "Hi." We all walk together. Jake and my guy used to work together and Jake has made it big. He gives my guy 90 (0?) percentage, which pleases him. We walk out past a display in a museum where we see Basaltic rock columns rising and falling. The narrative tells us that that's where the Killer Bees live and thank God, they are disappearing so there's less bees. I see two naked men tortured by being covered with these bees.

I go to the nursery and am handed a tiny baby that fits into my hands, so unformed, it's face doesn't have skin yet, just muscle and red. I lay it on my left arm and cuddle it. I concentrate all my loving energies toward it. Now the baby looks like a baby. I go to a sink and put water on my arms as that is better for the baby. I feel a need to pee, but can't leave the baby even for a moment. A nurse suggests she get me a bed pan. I try to feed the baby and suddenly it starts sucking at the thin drops of "mother's milk" I offered on a tiny tube/stick.

Third dream: I am standing on a sidewalk and a beautiful Indian man stands at my left. He's a dancer and the music is calling him. He starts to dance away and turns, smiling to invite me to dance with him. He'll teach me how to dance. As we are walking, the scene changes and we are walking into a cathedral. I think to myself, "How odd. Why am I dreaming a catholic church?" Then I notice it's a Mexican Mission. We are drawn in as a part of the crowd. We go upstairs and move to seats very close to another Indian man who is preparing his instrument. I am equally attracted to him and go closer. He has a guitar with a printer in it. Other objects are attached to it to make unusual music. I say to my friend, "Look, He has a large mosquito tied to a string." It hums and he amplifies it when it's appropriate. Unique instruments. Later, my dancing friend and I are in a car. He's in the driver's seat and we're about to drive away. (I'm in the passenger seat.) I look out the window and see a two-story house with windows that roll down like car windows and most of them are open. I see two huge bears (grizzlies) starting to get out the windows.

I realize some of the clothes on my floor have slid down into the hole. I wonder where my father is. He could fix the hole. I reach for the clothes and slide into the hole myself and fall under the house in a horrible pile of debris that is rotting away. I feel fear that I will rot with it. I fight my way back up into the house and walk down the hall asking where everyone is. Dwight is in his room, the furthest one away. My mother's in her room. I'm near the front door and a monster from hell comes at me. I am very afraid but stand my ground. I grab its tongue at its roots and pull, even though I know he'll bite me and it will be terribly painful. I poke his eye with a stick and drag him out of the house. He's unconscious and I crawl back to the house with a match. I light the carpet on the porch, wondering if I should go in first and get our possessions, but it is more important to torch it at once. I light it. The monster comes at me, but is consumed in the flames. I look to make sure all my family is safely out of the house.

I am approaching a barn, it is old, dilapidated and ugly. Inside is darkness and rotting, stinking stuff that I am supposed to clean up. I don't want to, and as I am walking to the door, I veer away, deciding not to do it. I then walk across a grassy pasture to a muddy embankment. I accidentally slip and fall, sliding down the embankment to a muddy area that is like quicksand. I am flat on my back and sinking, trapped and I know there is no way out. I am as good as dead. My sister Lydia is with me and she is already below the mud line. I see she is still alive because her eyes open and shut. It is almost time for me to go under. I feel fear and resistance, but I don't panic. I go under and am amazed I can still breathe. A wash of water goes over us, rising us, floating, out of the mud. We crawl out onto the grass. Then we get up, hugging each other and walking toward our house, which is around the left side of the barn. There are a series of Quonset huts like married student housing at OSU. The first one on the left is ours. It is old, the paint is peeling. I open the door and walk in. I see a blue cotton print dress on a dress form and I say, "Hi, Mama." I realize it is a symbol of my mother. I see movement in the bedroom, my "father" is sick and old and in bed. I don't want to go in, but I do. His face is bumpy and old-looking.

Some part of me seems removed, distant, almost objectively curious. I suddenly remember to ask my mother how she died. My mother said the four of them went to dinner at the Bates Restaurant. They all ate the same food and they all got sick, but Lydia must have eaten the worst, most poisoned part, and she died. They all threw up and had slimy, sticky diarrhea, but Lydia died from it. I shake my head in sorrow. She was so young and good and had so much to live for. Then I amend that part, living with Darryl, how could she look forward to living more? Cousin Patricia comes by to give me some photos she had of Lydia. It's tradition, when someone dies, people give back their photos to the loved one. I remember returning Terence's pictures to her.

I am swimming in a large swimming pool made of rocks cemented together, volcanic rock. It's crowded, lots of people, older women in pink suits, etc. I swim slowly and carefully, staying in the medium deep place where it's not over my head. I am aware of how out of shape I am! I slowly stretch and exercise my muscles. It feels good. When I hang on to the rocks on the side, some of them break off in my hand. They are kind of crumbly and "incompetent." I try to put them back. [BL] (94 words)

I am swimming, holding a baby girl. She and I are flying just above the water because we swim so effortlessly. I get cocky and we're flying/swimming over a huge expanse of water. Suddenly "my little girl" is there too and we start floundering. She goes under and I have a terrible dilemma. Do I let go of the one to save the other and endanger myself as well? I dive for her and find her. Now I'm working hard to keep all of us afloat. I see a huge rubber life raft and we get in it, only it must have a leak in it because it's very limp and water is getting in. We fold up the limp parts and I ask the girls to bail. We manage to stay afloat. We float over to an opening in the wall and I see monsters, three ugly things. They capture me and put me in a cage with it hanging over some boiling oil or black sewage gunk. If I don't choose one of these uglies to marry, they'll dump me in the gunk. I don't know which fate is worse. I decide to choose one of the uglies. [BL] (200 words)

I see a bear off in the distance. It's the one my father, an Indian Chief, has happily pursued and hunted for years. It's his great joy to try and capture this bear. It is coming toward me and I must protect myself or it will kill me. I have my father's .22 rifle. I shoot at the bear over and over, but it only enrages him and he's close now. I aim for the eye and shoot and shoot. Now he's on top of me, mauling me. I keep shooting and finally it dies. I crawl out from under it and crawl, bleeding and maimed, to my father's horse. I put my father's rifle in the holster on the saddle and ride back to tell my father I have killed his bear. I am worried he will be upset because I've brought to an end his favorite sport. I see a small, naked Native American man. He's out of shape and his body fat is down around the belly and hips. He tries to suck it all in and his chest rises to look more manly. [BL] (187 words)

A man, Claude, is dancing ballet on stage with a group. I am watching from backstage. It all looks fun, cultural and nice, I keep moving around to see him better. I realize I'm sort of on stage at one point and move out of the way. After the dance, he comes over. We are shy, but like each other. I'm seated on a chair and he sits on the same chair. We are close and talking. Then he puts me on his lap. I hope I don't weight too much. I wish I'd lost some weight. We have coffee/tea, drink and chat, really enjoying each other's company.

Now I'm in a room full of women. They are all talking and laughing. They throw dice. I am annoyed, perhaps tired and sleepy, and suggest that I throw the dice and if I win, they have to clear a quadrant of the room so I can have it to myself to sleep and have quiet. They are insulted but agree. I throw two big fluffy dice and I can't count the round black buttons correctly. At first it looks like 8 or 9. Then a woman says its 4 20's. That means I won. Someone suggests I go out and sleep in the hall, where one of the dice had rolled. I am agreeable; it's further from the noisy chatter; but I stay in the room and sleep on my quadrant that I won. I wish they'd quiet down so I could sleep (curled up on the floor.) [BL] (149 words)

A woman is the boss. She tells us what to do. We volunteer to help at a store. It's been a hard day and I'm starting to go home. I pass a beat-up car in the grass and think I've seen that image before. Why am I seeing it again? It must mean something. Maybe I dreamed it. Another woman and I walk past (I'm in my wheelchair) the candy section in the store. She pulls off a box and opens it. I remember we get things for free because we work there. I say, "Wait," and turn to look at the selections. I see the ice-cream section and wonder if there's any sugar-free ones. I see the cookie section. There's a machine. The boss woman put dough in it and huge, sticky rolls come out. They aren't quite done right, a bit doughy but still delicious. People are eating them. I try a bite, wondering if all that sugar will affect my irregular heart beat. The boss woman is crazy and goes off. I guess she dies. The other woman says to me, "At least I talked Sweet Liberty from walking." She felt proud of that. (Sweet liberty is a woman who is upset at the crazy boss woman and almost left.) I offer to help at the counter and the other woman says no, there's not much I can do, being disabled. All I could do would be the easy parts that everyone wants to do, like the cash register. I say, "Now don't be too hasty. Let's check it out. I might be more help to you than you think." [BL] (273 words)

I get out of the car and run. They chase. I go into my house and try to lock doors. I call 911 and hide under the telephone table. The woman who answers the phone is a nurse. She's impersonal and taking her time. I ask her to tell the police to come to 837 A. Street. [the names Steven V and Victor, a feeling of lots of mean men are out to hurt me. [BL] (99 words)

A man and a woman want to make love and are looking for a place where they can be private. A man hides in closets and the woman goes from closet to closet looking for him. She sees a boy coming to the closet to hang up his hats. This bothers her because he'll find their closet and interrupt. He goes in and is now in his own room. Three puppets are hung up on the hat rack. He's afraid of one of them because it has huge black circles for eyes and looks scary. He calls to his daddy who says there's nothing to worry about. Then the two male puppets are moving and talking. One turns to the other and wants to make love, so the other one becomes a "female" and they have sex. I feel orgasm. A voice says, "That's OK, they are doing this because they are not really homosexual, they are both" (meaning bi-sexual). [BL] (160 words)

Mary is laying in the bathtub taking a bath. My bath chair is out and I am standing, intending to bathe standing and wondering if I'll be able to stand that long. Nancy comes in to scrub Mary's back and I sit on the toilet to have a watery bowel movement and hope it doesn't stink. I try to wipe myself and get some on my thumbnail. The sink is filled to overflowing. I rinse my thumb and continue to wipe my butt, which has streaks of it. Suddenly Mary yells, "The Clinic," and gets up and runs so fast out of the bathroom that she doesn't even bother to open the door, she goes through the door, like she's a spirit or melts through it. I comment on that to Nancy, it is so amazing. Mary comes back very upset because she was right. She just missed her clinic appointment and it was so important. She's leaving for Mexico and wanted to know what to do if she got raped and they used knives to cut the inside of her vagina. I try to be helpful and suggest she can find some books on the subject at Paralandra's. It wouldn't be the same, but maybe it would help. [BL] (209 words)

My mother is fixing a huge special breakfast: eggs, pancakes, bacon, sweet rolls. I look forward to it and pick up the sweet rolls and put them in a pan on the burner to cook through. My mother speaks to me and I can't understand her for several tries. Finally I smile and say, "OK, I'll get it, I should not have put the rolls on so soon." I try to pick them up and they come apart. It's a mess. I am aware that I'm handling this situation differently than I usually do. I am more open and willing to admit a mistake and willing to try and fix it, rather than get all stubborn in my anger and shut down or snap back. [BL] (125 words)

I am at a school dance with my younger sister Lydia, pretending I am her age of 13. A young man (like Nate or Larry of high school) is drawn to me and I play coquettish 13 years old. It's time to leave, and as I go down the stairs, I start to look and act a bit older (16 years or so) and he is very enticed. I wear a sweater combo like in the 1950's. He follows. I run, laughing to my car and tell Lydia to hurry. We get in and he comes to the driver's side and wants to talk. I roll the window (wet from rain) down a quarter of the way. The window is a barrier for closeness and he asks me to open it more. I slowly, flirtatiously do so until it is full open. He wants to kiss me and I want it too, but hold off because of my tender age. I tell him I'm going to Judy's house to meet friends. He could go there too. We drive away, and I go to Judy's house, without Lydia now. I greet some girlfriends and soon he comes in and asks me to dance. I agree and we begin a slow dance. He bends down to kiss me and I turn shyly away. "I'm too young yet." "All right," he says, "but don't let anyone else kiss you. Let me be the first." I promise and we dance more closely, hugging; we know we are made for each other. [BL] (257 words)

And as I do this, he turns so he's facing me. He's on top of me and I feel his hard dick and at first he can't seem to get it in and I reach down and help him. Between us, we get him in and it feels marvelous. We joyfully make love. [BL] (114 words)

I am going to a bookstore and start walking, hoping to catch the bus. It's two minutes until the bus is expected. I'm on 14th street and am headed for 10th. The walking is hard going and painful. I get there. It's a conveyer belt of canned goods. A woman helps check them out. They are packaged up in plastic crates with an identifying tag so you know what's yours and where one stops and the other starts. Now I'm watching couples at a "butt watching" fair or gathering. Three couples, all dark, straight hair, dark complexion (Italian) are together. One woman is very upset and a man is trying to help her. He holds her quarters for her without taking any. She doesn't trust he has done so sand asks another woman to check for her. The other woman counts the eight quarters and the one silver dollar and hands them to me to hold for her. It's confirmed and she hugs the man. They are very close, cuddling. His arms are around her as she leans her back into his chest, then feet out in front of them, intertwined. The other woman says, "You can't do that if your not going to get married." This makes them think because they were intending to be just very good friends until she was cured and then she would go on and marry someone else. She looks over and sees the man's best friend and decides to marry him. This causes the man to turn and look long and searching into her eyes. He now wants to marry her. I think she wants it too and was using a ploy to get his attention. [BL] (283 words)

Katrina tells me to flap my wings and fly up high. I try, but it is hard. I go through the layers of wood in the frame of the house and he is on the opposite side, nearly getting me (see drawing in dream book).

I am going up a mountainside. I am scooping up a fine dust into a container. I think the container is full, but then I notice several big rocks in it and empty the rocks onto the ground. Now there is lots more room in the container and I scoop up more fine dust. I fill the container. Now I am at the top of the mountain, which is shaped like female genitals. The top of the mountain is indented like the vulva. It's like a Phillips screw head with a "crossroads" in the top. On the left side, the gold has all been panned out, long ago.

I did research on a board game and played it myself to understand it. It involves movie stars. I now am sharing the game with a group of friends: Hillary of Merton Circle, Bob M of Counseling and two other women. I look up to the ceiling and see four large glass or ceramic things we'd somehow secured up there. One is a large cat ceramic (like the one on my fireplace). Another is a dog one, like a cookie jar. One is a huge red glass bowl with ornate embossed patterns on it, very Victorian and beautiful. I notice it's crooked and may fall. I am concerned because we are seated right under it. In the game, there is a MaMa card and a Doctor card. There are four categories to choose from. One is a picture of a young girl (7-8 years old) fleeing from a woman, perhaps in Indian (eastern) dress or early 1900's dress. The theme is the girl was hurt very badly by her mother. I don't remember the other three categories. I see Ginger Rogers seated near the board. She is one of the women in the group, and I say, "You were my mother in a movie. I'm not surprised you don't remember, I had forgotten too." Now I'm having trouble remembering how to play the game and it is getting boring. I fold it up like an accordion credit card holder, wondering why I thought it was such a good game. [BL] (249 words)

I and two men are in a large house. We've been up all night writing. Taking turns writing in a computer in a small room that looks out over the ocean. I am distracted from writing when I glance out the window and see how very blue the water is and I think I see a seal. But it is two black dogs sitting in a shrub tree. Then I see penguins and gulls all over. I realize it is the rocky surf and not yet the ocean I am looking at. The ocean is much further out. It is low tide. I then realize I'll never get my writing done if I spend all my time gazing at my ocean. The one man and I are a team helping each other as we write and co-writing the thing. There is a good mutual admiration society going on. [BL] (148 words)

I am living at home with my parents in M City. I have three cars and someone delivers some oil. It squirts out of the hose and leaks all over as it fills a tank outside the house. I feel better having it full now. I get in my red car with a floor stick shift and start to drive. I turn the corner to the left and squeal out, liking the good way the car is running. I feel pleased that I have three running cars now and Howard doesn't have as much. I feel a bit sorry for him, and as I drive I realize he wants to talk to me and wonder what it's about. I am feeling a bit superior about being better off than Howard. Then I remember I still live with my parents and feel embarrassed because I should at this age be out on my own. Even though I need someone to live in and help me, I could do that with a roommate. That would be more adult than relying on my parents. [BL] (181 words)

I look up and the baby girl has gone off to talk to some people. I feel tired, but it is my duty to teach her the more disciplined way of not barging in other people's conversations. I go get her and bring her back. She is not happy about that. Soon I see that she has gone again and I get up and retrieve her again. I feel tired, but know this is the only way to assist her to get along better with others. Later, we are in our apartment. I am in a dining area and a big living room adjoins it. There is also a bedroom space where my bed is and another open space where her bed is. I walk into the bedroom area and see it's really a barn. There is a layer of hay on the floor and the whole end wall is missing and open to the outdoors. I am surprised and repeat to myself, "I live in a barn." I go back to the dining area and then feel danger. I know the elevator is going to crash through the ceiling. At first I think it is the girl that lives above us dancing too much or something. I look up and see a square and then it opens up and an open elevator crashes through with two people on it, one a boy and the other a huge fat woman. It smashes the couch and I am relieved to know I or the little girl wasn't sitting there or we'd have been smashed. [BL] (263 words)

I am in the front row of a huge audience in a big gym for a rock concert. I am in a manual wheelchair. There are some other disabled people in the audience but mostly they are ab's. There is a large empty floor space between the first row of audience and the stage. On the stage is a group of men playing rock music. One is particularly attractive. He says he will kiss one of the disabled people. I go up quickly to the edge of the stage and he comes down on the floor and picks me up in a lavish body dancing dip posture and exaggerates a kiss. I play along dramatically. As we finally kiss, I realize he is wearing a wooden mask with a small hole for the mouth and he "tongues" me through the hole. He whispers his apology and says that later we will really kiss. I feel frustrated, but try my best to kiss real good. Our tongues touch. I go back to my seat. Now the group resets up their stage setting on the floor right in front of me. They have a play they will do and create fold-out sets and costumes in a wardrobe, within a foot of where I sit. I am excited I will get to see things so close. He asks how many disabled there are in the audience. They yell or raise their hands. There are a few. I change to my power wheelchair to dance with him. [BL] (253 words)

The women come in and I give them the keys to their complementary resting rooms and try to connect with the man. He is allusive. I suggest I show him his room; he can use mine. I take him to the elevator. He turns and walks away. I turn and push number 4 and the elevator opens.

I start to go downstairs but she says, "No, let's do it the easy way, and put the phone on hold and dial 86, the extension." She does so and we wait. I see Lionel walk past the door across the hall and don't call out to him. We wait some more. Naomi calls again, number 85. She goes out. I start to move the bed myself. It was pretty easy.

Someone exchanges the little glass pitcher or creamer with another one that matches the bowl already there. It's like my mother's cranberry sauce bowl, glass rounded ribs. I say, "Very nice, but probably more expensive and too big to be in scale." I go on. I remember to look for a video camera case to fit my video camera and ask a man. He is condescending and looks for an ordinary case. I am annoyed. Can't he see? I say, "If you would just look at MY camera, you would see it is a more complex and advanced camera."

I pull off layer after layer of cardboard some with writing on it from the baby's mother, I finally find the baby in a plastic molded container like she was a doll.

I hesitantly agree. I want her to stop, but I feel squeamish about doing it myself. So they shot her with a gun and she falls. Now we have to get rid of the body, but I notice she's not dead yet. She's still breathing. One of my friends puts her on my bed while she goes looking for something to finish her off with. I feel real dread at being so close to her. She stares out vacantly, breathing. I feel sick, being so near her. I start to feel remorse. First she felt ill anyway, and now we've added the pain of a bullet and blood. Someone suggests we give her an overdose of pain killers so she'll be free of the pain and finally die. I agree and then I feel bad and decide it's best to turn ourselves in with her so she can get help. It was wrong to try to kill her. I agree to take the full blame and I say I will tell the authorities that I killed her and shot the gun myself. That way my friends won't get in trouble for trying to help me.

Unbeknownst to me, the man wants to marry me and is setting up this ceremony to camouflage the wedding ceremony. So Paulina and start walking and soon find ourselves out in a desert area like near M City. No one else is around and the road seems unmarked. We wonder if we are in the right place. I look back and see the dirt road and some people coming out way far back. So I know we are just ahead of everyone else. We continue on. Then we see some wooden houses, white man buildings, and realize that in order to make us comfortable, they have built this little village. We look at each building and admire it. They are cute. Now the Native American man comes to me and suggests I sit with the children during the ceremony rather than in the bleachers with the audience. I agree. He then shows me an ordinary smoking pipe and says if this is handed to me, I must hold it in my cupped hands just as he shows me, or I will offend the gods. I agree and watch carefully. I ask how I should return it after I have taken a smoke. He says, "Turn it this way (full circle, clockwise) and hand the pipe stem first." I listen carefully and nod. The ceremony begins.

I am on stage, as a sort of stage manager, in C City. A little black girl is going to do ballet and tap dancing. She does the ballet and the audience loves it, although it is a redneck audience and usually doesn't care for this sort of thing. I think some rough man kind of forced them to be there, because he wanted the girl to have an audience. Just before the show, I had looked through the curtains to see only a few people seated up front and to the left side. There is a short intermission for the girl to change into her tap shoes. The time gets longer and the audience gets restless. I think, "I'd better do some Evangeline if this keeps up." She comes back, but she doesn't want to dance now. She says her tummy is upset and she had to go to the bathroom and maybe she'll dance, maybe she won't. I say, "Then I need to know. Take one minute to decide. Either way it's OK. If you dance, fine, if you don't, fine, I will just do my Evangeline character. But I need to know now!" She agrees to dance. I go out front of the curtain and chat with the audience about how the town hasn't changed much since I was there years ago. [BL] (225 words)

I am seated at a round table with other people and we are being guarded by alien beings (sort of reptilian). They are feeding us to fatten us up to eat us later. I realize this and pass my food on to the others so I won't get fat. I hope they don't notice. I watch them carefully, feeling fear because I know at some point I shall have to make a stand and will probably be killed. At one point I am somehow flying up the outside wall and peeking inside a window where two aliens are going to make love. As they do, I overhear one saying in horror, "You have a white cross mark on your hand." This means that their blood will kill him if he contacts it. I then know how I can save myself. Now I am back at the table and I try to set up a fight between aliens so their bad blood will kill themselves off. I hope I'm not killed in the process. [BL] (173 words)

Dovre is choosing some miniature furniture from my collection. She has to return home and I am going to drive her to the airport in the next small town, but she says she prefers to go farther to the Hartford airport because she wants to hang out in the big city for a while. I am annoyed. I don't want to take that kind of time and energy. Then I feel guilty because a good mother would do this happily for her child. I am being selfish. [BL] (87 words)

I am driving a motorcycle "car" with two seats. It's sort of a race. I must stop for gas very often, like every ten feet or so, and I keep forgetting to turn the engine back on. Then I spin my wheels, wasting the gas. A dark-haired young woman in an emerald green outfit is racing me. She is behind me and never smiles. She'd ask me when I stop for gas and then I'd pass her on the road. The road is curvy like a curved staircase. A young man (maybe Dwight) is in the passenger seat. I think I wear the old-fashioned motorcycle hat with flaps over the ears, made of leather. [BL] (114 words)

I am in danger. There are aliens and we must run. A woman says, Synchronize your watches." I see mine is set now for 10 of 1:00. We take a deep breath and start walking briskly down the sidewalk. Now we must do what is called chaining. There are fringes of styrofoam-like curls like packing material on our ankles and when we come to a doorway or checking area, we must give up one chain. The door was coming frequently (like taxing booths), the paths are branching out and soon we will lose all our chains and then God knows what will happen to us. I think I carry a child or two in my arms. We are like fleeing Jews. [BL] (121 words)

There is a bad guy that can emanate some horrible, painful sound or radiation that keeps everyone his prisoner. Just at the moment he turns it on, I as a superman kind of being disintegrate and disperse my molecules as I fly up and away. He's upset I got away. But now I must go back and fight him in order to save my family, now frozen in his power. I go, via instructions from some feminine voice, to a platform up in the clouds and there are some remote control-like game boards in a basket. I pick up one. The voice says, "This one can be adapted well." I look at it closer. It is a chess game, electronic. I say "Ah, the good old chess game," satisfied it can be modified to fight this powerful man and save my family. I turn it over and look at the back side of it and see the tiny shapes of the black "men" or pieces. I want to review the rules of how they are allowed to move. [BL] (178 words)

I am in a large room, sort of like a gym with furniture. Merle and I are exercising. I am standing and doing stretches. One leg up and then the other and stretching every part of me. It felt wonderful. I tease Merle and tickle him on his round tummy. Now we are moving furniture, a yellow couch. Ginny helps. I pin some yellow sheets of paper up on a side wall of a stage area that is not accessible to wheelchairs. I walk, so it's no problem for me. Someone takes them down and I say, "Hey, put them back! I put them there so people can write on them. I am expecting lots of school kids to come." He says, "But it seems there are better places for this." I say, "I looked. This is the best place." Then I look around again and realize that the main gym wall is accessible and all I would have to do is move the kid's pictures displayed there up here on the side stage wall and use that space. I go to the man and say, "You were right. There is a better place." I go down to do that. I see a huge map of the world on the wall, and later I see it's gone. Now the kids are arriving. I see someone has taken something of mine and I complain, but what shall I do about the pain? I look and I see two Alka Seltzer pills and a small pill. I tell Ginny that these are mine, for the pain. Ginny is busting two kid girls for having drugs. She is lecturing them. [BL] (277 words)

I am camping out with a couple of men and their boys. The other wife didn't come, so I sit alone while the men go out hiking or something. I sit rather bored on a log or something. I lay back and notice the sky. On the left side, it is twilight and an occasional star. On the right side, is a black sky filled with stars. I wonder why that is and look back and forth at the differences. I then see on the right side that part of the difference is there are lots of cloud-like things which is the Milky Way. Now the men come back with the boys and are cutting up a big meat loaf into strips and squares to eat. I say to one of the men that I wish his wife Irene were here so I'd have someone to talk to. Then I look up in the sky again and see ducks, lots of them flying by, big adult ducks and lots of baby ducks. One duck attacks another and bites it. I realize they are very hungry. I want to feed the baby ones and get some bread and crumble it up. Some adult ducks land and eat and then a baby duck comes down and sticks to a wall. I go over to see it and notice it is a piece of cardboard folded in half and I open it to see a purple colored jewel and realize these ducks aren't born yet. This is their embryo in this jewel-like thing and they are still growing and forming. I regret having called them down and try to send them back on their way, hoping I haven't caused them any harm.

I am in a wheelchair and decide to go out the front door of this hotel. I open the door and a car is parked right by the door. I ask someone to help me and I get out of my chair and get into the passenger side of the car. The other person then takes the wheels off the chair and folds it and puts it in the car with me. I thank them, shut the door and now transfer over to the driver's side of the car and open that door. I pull out a tool and reach for the parts of the chair to reassemble it. I was using the car as a transition to get to the driveway so I can continue on. I realize I am making a lot of work for myself. There must be an easier way. I start to sew the button on a sweater, which is putting the wheels back on the chair, sort of. One side of the sweater is pink and the other side is blue (like reversible). The button is big, white and thick. This is going to take lots of time and energy. [BL] (196 words)

I am doing an absurd skit with Justin. We run about the garden looking at trees and making jokes. He says we must only look for the A tree and the B tree. I run around in an English way with an English accent and say, "Oh where could the 'A' tree be? Oh, here it is." He follows me around closely, trying to be the tree. I ignore him. "Oh, where is the 'B' tree? Here? No, here? No, ooh here it is, no, that's a bee, an insect, not a tree. Then here? Now here's an interesting tree! Look over there, it has a very interesting root structure, if we only could see it. We lay down on the ground and he picks up the bottom of the raised root structure (like mangrove trees) and I snicker and say, "Oh I must be wrong," but if it were the right tree, then it would be all raised and interesting. We are laying there next to each other, teasing. A man opens the door and stares down at us. Finally we get up and he glares and says, "Are you going to do this again?" We humbly say no, trying not to laugh. "Good," he says dourly and slams the door. We giggle and Justin says, "Where is a kissing tree?" I laugh and go to him and put my arms around him and kiss him saying, Here. I found one, a kissing tree." [BL] (245 words)

He puts his arm around him and says, "Is that what you want?" The robot doesn't respond but Ellie insists that is what he wants. Another bad guy robot says he can't hear them, so let him read about it. Ellie insists he can hear them. She says he's audio. (NLP) I grab him and lay him down, with my legs wrapped around him in a wrestler hold and I say things and watch his eye patterns. "Yes, he is audio," I confirm.

They do it and then I have them back. The robot bad guy says, "Then I have a favor to ask of you. Will you put this package in MY car?

Then the building suddenly is gone and I am shocked. It is supposed to be there but all I see is a new street intersection. I realize I am looking at a future picture.

One is trying to share his feelings and another man is belligerent and noisy and interrupts him and they get into a verbal fight. Finally I say, "That's enough, you, leave."

A plant like my angel wing begonia lies in pieces on the floor where it was knocked over. A woman picks it up and brings the stem and leaves to me and says, "Look. Part of this is still alive. But it is without care and water for so long, but if you take care of it, it will live again." I am saddened and amazed that this could be revived. I sit up, now realizing I too am alive. My parents (sort of like Grandma Mildred and Grandpa Lloyd) are in the room and I get up and walk to them. They are shocked and happy to see I am alive. I go to Grandpa "dad" and he is seated in an easy chair, and I say to him, "Don't ever do this again. You left me for dead." He apologizes and his eyes are sad as he realizes what he did. I go back and sit on the couch and look out the window. High up on the hill is a new building, the new schoolhouse. My friends are there. I wave at them and my best friend sees me and they all run down to see me, so glad I am alive again. They swarm into the house. I am excited to see them.

I am at a conference, only it's in my living room. A woman comes from California and teaches. We'd had one last night and now I wake up on the couch and it's time for another one. The women come in and I sit up. The instructor is in the kitchen taking the dishes out of the dishwasher from last night as I hadn't gotten up and done them. I apologize to her, saying she doesn't have to do that. The dishes are white glass with gold trim on the edges. Bonnie had put them in because they'd been in my cupboard for so long and needed washing, from all the accumulated dust. A woman like Kathleen from poetry group sits on my right. I am telling them how the first time I used the word "abuse" to describe my upbringing felt so shocking, because it wasn't physical abuse, but emotional abuse. They were good people, but didn't know how to express themselves. Kathleen encourages me to keep calling it abuse and not cave in to society's ways of denial. I agree that I will persevere. I get up and say I need to pee and brush my teeth. There is a tiny alcove next to the living room, with a curtain as a door. I sit on a tall white bucket which sits on a toilet. I balance precariously. I pee a torrent of urine. It all rushes out of me at once. I know it can be heard by the women. Then the one man participant arrives. I immediately spill urine on the floor, it splatters from the rushing torrent. I am embarrassed. The topic f the conference is Men's Issues. I don't really want to be there, but I need the credits.

I have to pee really bad. I am in a house. Some man is injured and I am helping him. A cat is there somewhere, maybe also needing help. I go into a bathroom and try to sit on the toilet. It breaks off from the wall and is wobbly. I am standing and peeing so I won't tip it over. I pee voraciously all down my leg and around the room in front of me. I am concerned the water will back up and flow out of the toilet onto the floor. I leave. Now I am going from room to room in a hotel-like exhibit. I look out the window and see the beautiful emerald green ocean waves far below. There is a crowd of people walking through the exhibit as I am. I really need to pee and consider finding an exhibit toilet and using it. One room has a whirlpool and a single bed with an air mattress-like thing, sort of a health spa room. I wonder where people sleep and see another room with beds in it. I go out the door and go to the next exhibit room. On the way I see parrot beaded earrings and go over to see the price: 1 or 2 dollars, very cheap. I don't really want the parrots, but like crystal things or beaded things. [BL] (228 words)

Suddenly I realize that Deepak Chopra is sitting at the table. I see he looks ill. He has a snot booger hanging off his nose and looks bad. I say sympathetically, "You look ill." He smiles weakly. I try to help him. I offer to sort his speeches in chronological order for him. Later I go to his house with him as we'd struck up a relationship, but there aren't ramps and it is hard to get in and out.

Then I am told it is being held in another spot and I go there to discover I'm a bit late and only get a spot in some other more distant section. It even requires another entrance at another field, called "Hunsaker "or something like that. I start to try and find the place to go and am told I have to take a shuttle bus thing there. As I am going to the bus stop, I tell some woman the story of how people resent people with disabilities and tell the Chopra story of the woman who said, "You have kind of an advantage, don't you?" I find a bus stop, but I'm not sure this is the right spot and I do not want to miss the bus. One comes from the wrong direction and stops and I run over to ask the driver if this is the right one or not. I nearly get hit by the bus as it pulls up to the stop. It is "articulated." He looks down at me and I can't seem to understand him, whether this is the one or not. I finally decide this is the one going to the station and go back to my spot to wait.

I am very upset, because I scratched a sore scab and it is coming off with my hair attached (like my psoriasis of long ago) and I have bald spots. I am looking in the mirror at all the ugly black and blue bald spots and bloody lines where I've scratched them. Maybe my daughter Ellie, or someone like her, agrees to shampoo my hair and color it with dye. My hair is a dark black now. I don't know how I like that (color of June's hair). My blouse and bra are off and now two old men, gay men, get in the bathtub to do therapy together. I feel a bit uncomfortable, being so naked, but think, "Oh well, it's OK. This is a clinic." I turn and am now putting on my bra. One of the old men, now out of the tub says, "I hope she keeps the cleavage. It's great cleavage." I look into his eyes and he has on weird glasses like opera glasses inset into his eyes. I hurriedly try to get dressed. There is another room where patients are being treated, mental therapy.

I am in a living room, apparently mine and my new boyfriend and his 4-year-old son are with me. I am seated in an easy chair trying to clean up the area around me. It seems that lots of Charla's toys and junk from Ellie living there are piled up in the corner. The boy wants to play with his toys, but there is no room until I get the other stuff picked up. Now Ellie comes in and wordlessly starts picking up things. She pulls down the Christmas lights from the wall and other old decorations. It is way past Christmas. This is encouraging. I say I want to talk with her. The boyfriend realizes we need privacy and says he'll go to the other room for a while. Now Ellie and I sit side by side on another couch and I am very angry at her and I am slapping her face, only now Ellie is a tiny baby and I slap her face over and over. Now we decide to go upstairs to my bedroom for more privacy and Ellie leads the way upstairs. It is hard to walk up the stairs and the entry way is a cubby hole, not a door, which makes it physically hard to even get in. Then after we hunch down to crawl through, we have to step on a rickety ladder of sorts built up with like video or CD cassettes in a wooden rack which my boyfriend had built for me. That angers me too. Why did I choose such a difficult entryway to my own comfortable and nice room? [BL] (271 words)

Ellie comes over with Charla. She says she wants me to baby-sit her so she can go out to breakfast. She seems shy and hesitant. I think, "Well she might, after all we've been through." Ellie comes over to me, her face soft and child-like, and starts to hug me. Then she curls around me and wants to nurse, pulling my breast out of the bra. I am shocked. I say, "What are you doing?" She says something like a 4-year-old child might. She nurses. I know something is very wrong and don't know what to do. I remain calm. The sexual feeling of the nursing is beginning and I know she has regressed to some childhood place and I want to support her, but this is so odd. I can't do much other than tolerate the moment. I try to pat her and lay my arm around her, but I am not genuinely being her mother as a 4-year-old might want. I gently distract her from the nursing. It is clear now Ellie has a severe mental regression problem. Charla is clear and direct and her own energetic self. My mother calls me asking if I'd found the first aid papers yet. I say, "No, I have a real big crisis here and haven't had time to look." Ellie wraps her body around me. I say to her, "You are a 25-year-old woman, with a child. You need to act like one." Ellie doesn't seem to notice, she's so off in her own world. I know I have to have her committed. I'm not sure how to do that. [BL] (270 words)

He is annoyed, in fact, angry at me. He says, angrily, "You are better than this, trying to manipulate it so we are alone. I don't like it when you do that. You know better than that." He hangs up on me. I feel terribly hurt and rejected, numbed by the pain of it. I turn and people are cheerfully calling out to me to join the party. I try to respond to them but it is very difficult. I go out to the back yard and something about Charla only having her diapers on. I see her and see she has an outfit of clothes on and looks fine. I comment that she is fine, perfectly and properly clothed. Her "mom" and "dad" want to stay at the party and I want to leave, to be alone. I tell them they can stay as long as they want. The "dad" says, "But she only has one diaper. We'll only be able to stay as long as it lasts." I shrug; not my problem. I try to leave. I feel weighted down with the sadness of Archie's rejection.

Derek kisses me. I am disappointed because his mouth is hugely wide and it doesn't feel good. He French kisses and it is intense, our tongues intricately intertwining. I feel him have an orgasm and I am untouched with sexual passion. It feels very cold and self-serving. Now I am being chased by him and other people. I run for my life. They are gaining on me and then I am backed up to a huge barbed wire fence. I turn and fight hard, without guilt. It is simply necessary to defend myself. I box kick and do karate moves. I force the fence into a man's throat, so the barbed wire is poking his throat. I demand they open the gate. It slides open enough and I dart across "no man's land," a railroad yard, tracks and mud. A "living" box car is trying to run me over as I try to race across the land and over the tracks. It moves like a cartoon creature out to get me. I cross the other fence on the other side and run like hell. The landscape is dismal and frightening. I turn left and am in a hall-like place like the storage unit place. I duck into a storage unit where green plastic upholstered dining chairs from a 1950's style are stored. I sit in one and slide the door partially shut and tremble in terror. [BL] (236 words)

I am somewhere, supposedly at my place of work, only it isn't. I want to pee and try to in a bowl; it stinks and is exposed. A woman, perhaps Maren, follows me around. I am annoyed. I try to clean things up a bit, wash a dish, move a bottle to the sink. Then I go out into a large warehouse-like area and toward an open door. The woman moves ahead of me. I see the tip of a huge, black, shiny, pretty and dangerous tank. The woman steps out and is killed. I turn and walk back through the long huge warehouse building going toward the back exit. I am aware that maybe I should check and see if the woman really is dead, but that would be dangerous to me. Maybe I should warn other people, but I don't. I decide with a bit of guilt that I will call people and warn them after I get to my office, my place of work. I see cupboards and cabinets and think about hiding in one of them. I realize that is what I usually do in a dream, and decide not to do that this time. I find the back room, where two men are working, stacking wood furniture this company makes. I pass them without a word and go out the back door and around the corner. I look to the right and see the back end of the black tank which now looks like a large fuzzy black elephant, the same kind of fuzzy as my purse. I then run to the left and go up some steps to another building where my office is, only it's not my office and nobody is there and hasn't been there for a long time. [BL] (297 words)

I'm taking a shower with Marshall Peters. Somehow this is working with the clients together. The shower stream of water is very thin and weak. Now I'm showering with Lucy, only instead of us doing it together, we take turns. I lather up with thick globs of shampoo soap. I am dressed, so when I lift up the blouse and rub my tummy, I get the dress wet. in spots. Then I eat something. Then Marshall comes in and talks about his client, who is a mess and does everything wrong and can't keep herself or her house clean. I realize with surprise he's talking about his wife.

Derek and I are going to make love. A young girl, maybe Charla, is there. I'm sending her off to her room. I need to go pee. I ask him, "My place or yours?" He says, "Your place." I go find a toilet and pee a lot. Then this bathroom connects to my bedroom. I go in just as he is opening the door to the bedroom from the hall. He is standing, wearing a tank top and some leotard-like, flesh-colored outfit, like he's naked, only he's not. His legs don't move, and in fact I don't see legs. He's sort of stiff. We make love passionately. Now I go out and see Derek in a car. There are five cop cars in a line and his car is right behind them, a perfectly safe place to be. Another man is in the backseat of Derek's car and he opens the door and invites me in. I get in, happy to be alone with Derek. I curl up with the other man who says it's OK to press back against him if it's more comfortable. Derek gets out to rearrange himself and his assistant helps him back into the car. We are going to be together and that makes me happy. [BL] (211 words)

Sparky wants to plug in a string of Christmas lights that have a short circuit in them, or rather the switch in the wall does. The lights go on and off. I suggest she try another switch or plug in. Kenneth comes in dressed in a graduation gown, a witch's hat and funky platform-heeled shoes. Sparky is a bit taken aback. I say, "He's like that," somewhat proudly. Kenneth grabs the string of lights and says, "Let's try plugging them in over here." I am pleased he has the same thoughts as I do and acts upon them. Now he's hungry and wants to eat. He grabs a hamburger from a buffet bar in the center of the room and another one for Sparky. She says she doesn't want it. So he puts it back and places two sandwiches there. A fat, bald baby is sitting there and she takes a huge bite out of the sandwich. I go to her to stop her from eating Kenneth's food. Her mouth is overflowing with mayo. She's sliding off the high chair. I have a bag in my left hand and am trying to keep her from falling off the chair and keep feeding her too. I wonder why I didn't think to put down the bag so I could use both hands. Then a man is laying on the floor. His face is pudgy and bald like the baby's. He says he's joined the Marines. I say, teasing, "They only want a few good men," and he and I say together, "but if you're not a good man, they'll make your life hell." We laugh. [BL] (274 words)

I am a feisty old woman and my daughter is trying to run my life. I meet an old man and we are going out on a date. My grown grandchildren are watching, feeling happy for us. My daughter is sour and disapproving. I am like a pixie, choosing a video from a stack of them and deliberately misplacing them, mixing things up. Now we sneak out for the date and come back two weeks later. I say to my daughter, "We got married." She is shocked and then I laugh and say, "And then we got unmarried." It's like we got married to distress her and then got unmarried to be more naturally who we are. [BL] (117 words)

Derek is painting pictures of mountains. I am trying to paint one too. I have my palette and see a sort of yellowish color up in the right hand corner, an odd color for the sky. Derek starts to dabble in my colors and I ask him not to. I then awkwardly attempt to paint. I draw a steep-peaked mountain and remember what my father said about how mountains aren't really that steep. I redraw it in softer curves. I discover how leaving some portions of the canvas blank and using that whiteness as a part of the picture enhances the picture. I create many different mountain ranges with some kind of building structure in the left corner foreground. It's pretty good. [BL] (122 words)

I see a young teen boy (maybe 17 years old) on a raft in the ocean. He and his animal friends are on a mission, like Johnny Appleseed. There is a dog, a beaver, and other animals, including 87 baby tarantulas. When he began this journey, there had been only one adult. Even though he is a virgin and doesn't know how to make love himself, his job is to find the ducks and help them have sex so they will have baby ducks. I see many little baby ducks swimming around. He helps the female ducks sit on the male duck in the right position so the deed gets done. I know this because a male narrator voice is telling these facts as I see the picture. Now the scene changes and I am talking to a woman. She confesses she had another baby boy after Melvin. Although the woman would be Valerie, logically, it is Ginny. I now get to meet the long lost boy, who is an innocent young teen (as above). He has bright red hair. His name is Douglas. I say, "It's so nice to meet Melvin's half brother." He looks surprised and says, "Half"? I look over at Ginny. "Haven't you told him?" "Sorry." So they talk. I say to him, "I am called Auntie. I am like your Auntie." He formally says, "Hello, Auntie." I invite him to hug me. He does, but it's a bit stiff. Then he melts into a more natural hug. [BL] (252 words)

I read a book that took me along time to get into, but after I kept at it a while, became interesting. It is a series of vignettes about towns, the last one being Mapleton. Now I decide to move to Mapleton. I am biking down the old highway and see a lovely stretch of grass and decide to bike across the "moors" for fun. It's very pretty and pastoral. Now I am in town and finish my errand and am biking back to my new home. My front wheel keeps getting caught in the old grooves of the asphalt and it pulls me a bit, so I struggle to keep on the road. I manage. I cross a bridge. I see I have a long way to go, maybe eight miles. I hope I get home before dark. I'll be tired, but oh well, it's a pretty ride and an adventure. I am munching on carrot sticks. As I approach a railroad crossing, the red lights come on. I know I'm supposed to stop, but I don't. I slow down and look and then scoot across anyway. At the last track to cross I look up and realize the train is almost upon me. I get across and then see the crossing guard bar. I think, "How silly of me to have forgotten they'd be down, how will I get by?" Then I see a way to sneak around the end. I am hearing the nuns chant as they go to seek answers or information from a young mystic girl. She was called a "pronuncio." She keeps repeating over and over, "You can not be plotted.

I had been reading or watching a long story about this pioneer man and how he was so upset about the bad treatment of Indians. He wants to go out and fist fight every one who is calling him squaw man. But a woman says, "Don't waste your energy. Ignore them." Now I am a woman and I walk up to a seated Indian man, who is wearing an 1890's kind of black jacket, like Wyatt Earp would have worn, white man's clothes. He's the foreman. He calls out the black woman I will have as a slave. He hands me the white, little plastic bag which has her documents in it. It's her "freedom" bag. I take it and hand it to her. I say, "Elizabeth. I give you your freedom." She doesn't understand. She thinks I'm firing her and she'll be alone and poor. I say to her, "You are your own woman now and I'd like to hire you. I will pay $6 a week." The Indian man shows me a picture. It has a bright spotlight in the center and a sidelight where he's standing. He says, "I'm in the side light because I'm an Indian. I've always wanted to be in the center spotlight." I say to him, "I understand. Believe it or not, I am in the sidelight too, because I'm a woman with a disability. We get the same kind of discrimination." [BL] (239 words)

I see Tyler telling Charlene one of his stories and smile because I know she has heard it many times. I wonder if she will just stoically listen or what. She finally interrupts him and says she has heard it before. She leaves and he smiles sheepishly. Now the man comes into my bedroom. I think I am rooming in his house. His son is upstairs. He is a quad and the man is crying as he tells me that today the assistant can't come today and he will have to be left alone. I offer to call in sick at work and stay to help him, but it would mean moving him downstairs and I couldn't transfer him. The man is grateful. [BL] (157 words)

I, the dreamer, is watching a scene. I seem to identify with the married man. A woman and a man get married after a short, but loving, courtship. Soon after they are married, they begin to have misunderstandings and fights. They are always angry at each other and can't seem to reconcile it. They are miserable, yet they love each other. There is another man, an architect, who loves the woman and she goes to visit him. The jealous husband, who has another kind of career, follows her and comes into the house. The two men talk. The husband is angry and belligerent, but after a while the other man begins to understand that the husband is a good man, but hurt. So he helps the husband understand, and brings the woman and the husband back together, even though he still loves her. But now he is best friends with the husband and cares as much for him. The husband and the woman go out to the car to drive home when the woman's parents come to get in the back seat. They are argumentative and negative at the husband, who in his new-found understanding, doesn't tolerate it anymore. He tells them to shut up. The woman at first is upset and then understands that is right. She smiles at the husband. [BL] (222 words)

I am annoyed with his attitude and questions. The man says, "Why don't you lighten up?" I realize I am being sharp and grumpy, but I say, "Because I don't want to," which is true.

I feel fear. He is going to harass me. He then walks down the stairs to go to the bathroom. I sneak out of my room and run into my brother's room (actually the room my parents had). I crawl under the covers with one of my brothers trying to hurriedly pull up the covers over me. He's coming back up the stairs and I know a part of my shoulder may be visible. I know this won't work and I'll probably got my brothers in trouble too, but I stay there. He comes in and looks around. I think he sees me, but lets me be. He leaves. I go quickly back into my bedroom to the closet to try and change clothes before he comes back. As I pull a dress off a hanger, I am standing in the closet, which seems to have lots of room. A weird-looking girl comes and watches me. I tell her to go away. I pull on my dress, which I wonder if it is too fancy and will call attention to myself. I go downstairs to the kitchen where my mother is fixing French toast for breakfast. She wants me to do something and is grumpy. [BL] (248 words)

I seem to be the prison warden. The men are surly and dangerous. I have to stop something and I use fast karate blows. I am damn good at it and beat my foe. Another powerful inmate is watching me closely, looking for his opportunity. I then go to the infirmary for the doctor to bind up my wounds, but he is also my fiance and he rejects me, I think because he doesn't want me doing this dangerous job. I am hurt, but bravely go on. I return, exhausted and emotionally drained, to my office and find a young woman and a Hispanic man trying to make out on the floor by my door. I tell her to be in my office at 3 o'clock and I'll teach her about birth control and then I decide the man better be there too. This was yet another betrayal and I am angry and self-righteous, and yet I'm trying to be doing the right thing for these people too. I enter, but it isn't my office; it is a courtroom. I interrogate the prisoner who is on trial, the man I beat up, and the other powerful man is secretly sending him signals by scraping the legs of his chair against the floor when he should not answer.

I and another woman are entering a big auditorium. We want to get good seats so we can see the events on the stage and meet in the back with our small group easily. It will be very crowded soon, we know, because we went through this before. I go to the left rear side and get a folding chair and then decide to go to the right rear side as that's where the small group will meet, but the athletic team has reserved most of the seats in the back and so I change my mind again and go to the left rear side to find all the places are almost taken and finally decide on the aisle. The ceremonies are starting and I lean way over to see. It is Rosalie, the Mayor of E City doing a discussion or speech and she's written "Rosalie" on the blackboard. It's just one word, her own name. I laugh and share this with a woman next to me. Then a male actor comes in and waits his moment. As he gets up to take a leather bag up the aisle shouting his lines, I realize the fingers of my left hand are caught in the straps and I am running up the aisle behind him, desperately trying to get my fingers out. I am wearing a bridal gown and veil. I finally get unstuck and go back and sit down. I tell the woman how embarrassed I am, how conspicuous I was. [BL] (252 words)

I am in a church community room and a group of church members are there. I have led them to believe that I am dying and they are having a ceremony for me. It is their tradition to gather in a semi-circle around the injured or dying person. Each member offers a gift and connects with the one who is dying in very touching, loving ways. The woman explaining uses the following example: "If a dying person wants to be treated like a queen, then someone might bring them a robe and drape it over them and bow and treat them like a queen." So, first the group stands in the front of the room and sings "Oh, Come all Ye Faithful." I stand in front of them, singing with them. I am deeply moved and near tears as I sing with them. The song is beautiful and I haven't sung for a long time, what with my throat difficulties. I am feeling very guilty for accepting all this outpouring of love on false pretenses, since I am not dying. Ellie is there sitting to my left. She looks at me, knowing I am cheating.

I watch as a man with a blue face lies on the sidewalk and tells the woman he's with that he loves her. I chuckle because it is obvious they are strangers and the man is horny. I try to ask several men to fill out the questionnaire. They are too rushed and busy. One hesitates and I kindly assure him he can go on, I can find someone else. Now the bus accidentally got caught in the Rose Parade. The marchers are a bit annoyed at us and we try to drive out of the way and park in a parking lot. We see a man who is very angry at a policeman for reprimanding him and he is angrily smashing the policeman's car to bits. Now I am in a huge house, perhaps a mansion. I am worried about Charla. A woman has lured her away and has taken her into one of the rooms and is molesting her. I see an image of Charla with her vagina exposed. I race from room to room opening doors and looking.

We are trying to get them to nap as I walk around trying to think and organize how to manage this huge task. Finally, I get the baby to sleep. I open a door and it is a small bathroom. Really, only a bathtub is in it. I look at the kitchen, which has two or three wooden oak tables (dining room type) hanging way up on the wall for counter space. That will be awkward. Dwight/Howard comes in and I am frustrated trying to get his attention. He finally listens to my ideas but sighs and says, "It won't work. We made a mistake buying this rambling house and a mistake moving to M City. We belong back in the valley, so let's not take such care where things go and only unpack the essentials until we can move again." He then suggests we be friends again. I say, "No way." Now I kind of give up and sit on the couch with an older woman. I make a snide remark about how she can't work either because she's so old, and I can't work, cause I'm so old too.

Lori is there, rather upset with me, and hands me a paper. I feel trapped and don't want to deal with this face to face, but now that I am here, let's get it over with. The paper is a bill for a phone call made by a Mr. Nelson for $48. She wants me to pay it. I hesitate and then get clear. "No," I say, "I will not pay this bill. It is not my bill. And furthermore I am very unhappy that you billed me for the carpet. I will not pay for that. In fact, I am expecting you to reimburse me my prorated rent and my security deposit." She becomes very upset and dramatically says to her woman assistant she cannot listen to any more of this. Her face is contorted in over-dramatic nerves.

I and Andrea are trying to catch up with our group, but get lost and end up with a group of swimmers and divers. There is a swimming pool to the right, and in front of our bleachers is a pool used as the stage area. I watch a scene where a man and a woman get in a small rectangular rowboat and sing as we all sing the chorus. A wave or two comes up and splashes the woman and she mimes jumping up real quick so it doesn't get her all wet on her bottom. I and Aunt Bridget are sitting on the right side of the bleachers. It is very crowded. We sing along with the group but don't know the songs. I notice my voice is clear and pretty and I seem to be able to keep up with the words by listening carefully. I look over to the bleachers on my left and up and see a small group of people in green sort of fish costumes with green makeup on their faces. They are pretty and all the same. Now muffins and cookies and cakes are being served to the crowd and I can see they are moist and sweet and would taste really good, better than if we'd stayed with our own group.

I am upset with myself because for years I'd been taking a few classes here and there and often not finishing them or doing the work. I have a long string of incompletes on my transcript. I am wishing now that I had chosen a 2-year master's program and just focused on that and done it. I'd have something by now if I'd done that. Some how this has to do with moving to a new city to turn over a new leaf, many years ago. The feeling is that in some other dream I had moved to a city to start school. Now in this dream I'm at the other end. So I try to do some homework and now I go to the school office to pay my tuition and fill out papers. The secretary is busy and I watch a mentally retarded girl lean over the counter, laying on it in my way, so I walk to the right and catch a secretary's attention. She asks for $56. I hand her a sealed envelope with my tuition in it. I thought it was to be $53. She opens it and pulls out a piece of paper where I had drawn pictures. I look at it and am surprised to see many different pictures of my cat in different poses and postures. I thought I'd only done one.

I say to my friend, "Come on, let's follow and see if we can retrieve the corpse and take it back where it belongs." My friend is in agreement and is surprised I cared enough to do this. We figured the element of surprise will be with us, because we are so quick to go to where I am sure they are going to leave it, namely in the sorority lunch room activity center area. I search and search, in drawers, opening doors, etc. and finally find a box which it might be in. I pick it up and sneak off to find the male professor that it goes to.

The first moment I laid eyes on this white, large, two-story house, I loved it. The woman who owns it says she'll sell it to me and I can move in right now and we'll do the papers later. I and my daughters start to move in. Each can have their own bedroom, the outside lawn is spacious and pretty, the rooms large and comfortable. I begin to be concerned because I haven't even asked how much for the house and if I will qualify for a bank loan for that amount. I am tired of living in my cramped little house, but it was the best I could afford. This will be much more. I see the short, almost midget-sized woman who owns it and go to her.

Burt Lancaster and I are talking in a room. I am asking him about some of his movies. I ask him if a particular movie, "The Stone Commander," had a script or if they ad-libbed the thing. I think they ad-libbed. He says, "No, it had a script, in fact, it had two." I am surprised. Now I am counting rows of broccoli: 10 heads to a row and 10 rows. The woman who owns the broccoli asks what I'm doing. I say, "We need these for a movie about vegetables." She say, "Oh no, this is my favorite broccoli. It's so sweet." [BL] (103 words)

I am preparing to do a performance at a meeting. The woman boss is talking and I realize I don't have my scripts with me for the play. I start looking around the office. I make a mess with all the papers I look through. As I am frantically searching, I also notice that the audience is off in another part of the room, partitioned off. If we moved ourselves into their room, we would be seen better. I check and see that there is plenty of room beyond the office partition. I wonder why we were told to do it in the office in the first place. I am worried that I can't remember the words or the sequence of things we are supposed to do. I am unhappy, and frantic.

We are having a serious meeting about the wording of some document. It's like the C. Department people but it isn't. I go to sleep in the middle of it, because it is so boring. They want me to agree with what they wrote, but I don't want to comment because I feel it doesn't say anything of substance. Now the meeting breaks up and a man is teasing me. We are joking and he is surprised I am fun to be around. I show them another meeting room I had prepared. They ask if there is enough room for 20 people. I say, "The room capacity is 135, I would think there would be enough room." Now I am looking at pictures in a magazine of a M City-like region with a old "Gabby Hayes" kind of man in the picture. Now I am harmonizing with some man a song that goes like this, "Whoa. The sun comes up in the morning." The harmonizing sounds very good. They are impressed. [BL] (171 words)

I was looking at the moon and another thing that kinda looked like a cutesie-poo sun. I was with my friend Anna L., and Rita L., her mom, but it wasn't really Anna's mom - it was someone who looked like her mom. And then Rita got transported to the moon and told the people on the moon to take a man who looked like Al L. (Anna's father) and transport him to the moon. So they went down to earth (the people on the moon) to get the person who looked like Al, but Al - or rather the person who looked like him - did not want to go. The people who came from the moon told the person who looked like Al that the person who looked like Rita said to bring him to the moon. But then the person who resembled Rita said that she never said that. But the people from the moon said they had proof because they had one of Rita's 200 earrings. And that was the end.

I don't know when I had this dream, but suddenly I remembered it: Me and some of my friends in my class at school that was studying ETs, were at a dry dusty place. In front of us was a very high ladder that led to a black blimp-shaped building. We climbed, and when we got to the top we couldn't open the door. It was really dangerous, and we all freaked out. Finally, we got the door open and walked into a nice room with a black leather couch. A man dressed in all black turned to us, surprised. He welcomed us in, but my friends were gone. He was an astronomer, so I stayed to get info for my class that was studying ET life, and somehow I agreed to stay for at least a week. But my parents had wanted me to come home.

Bay Area girls: Grades 4-6:#219-01 (5th grader, 01/18/97)

I was saying "miss" and then there must have been an interruption/commotion. After, I think someone answered me with a rude remark. It was some sort of takeoff on a play and the part that I was reading, but the surroundings were not correct. It came and went quickly, or so it seemed. P.S. I think that I was so excited about this new dream journal that I tried to control my dream too much. That's why I can't elaborate.
Setting: In a green room instead of a stage, as if the play was in real life. More like an office painted green.
Characters: I was there, but as a different lady. Everyone else was unfamiliar. I think they were all busy, bustling around, with no time for my lady, even though she worked there with them.
Feelings and Thoughts: Neutral. I don't think much of it. It seems normal, and this particular one, unlike others that I've had in the past, doesn't seem to be trying to get a message through to me.

I was playing my violin with all my music friends. I am much more advanced than "Twinkle, Twinkle" but still, that's what we were performing. Last night I had a violin recital for real and played my hard pieces. At the end though, I played the duet to Twinkle. In my dream there was a girl at my level, or a bit above, who played Twinkle by herself, and then my other friends and I played duets but completely messed up. (This part didn't happen in real life.)
Setting: It was on the stage: the same one from last night for real.

I was on some sort of a baseball team; a sport I don't care for and have only played twice when I was forced to in P.E. We were a bad team and always lost, though we hadn't really played any games yet. I didn't care if we won or not, but mostly I was concerned about the ball giving me a concussion. A very good team came to our field, but not for a game. One of them called out times of the day and then batted the ball where a clock would show it. For some reason two kids and I were trying to find a fence to put up somewhere, but we weren't successful at all.
Setting: It was on a field I've not seen before, but sort of a combination of the school's and the one my brother's team plays at.

The kids on my team were a mishmash of grades, but were all from school. The two friends mentioned were in my grade. They were good friends of mine, but they really wanted to win as well as get the fence up. There were some kids on the other team from my school, but they were two grades above us at least.
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I'm sort of curious if I'm going to enter a baseball team because I sure haven't been thinking about it!

I was in a 1/2 P.E. class and 1/2 picnic with the P.E. teacher. It was a very odd situation. We were passing food and writing names on bits of paper: names for basketball partners. All of a sudden, some sort of low-flying, child-created, kid-driven aircraft came toward us. It touched some heads and playfully bumped a few of us purposely. When the 7th grade driver told us he could have injured us badly, I got terrified.
Setting: Basketball court on a hill on which there was a picnic table.
Characters: Half of my class now and half of the grade below us. The 7th grade driver was my brother's good friend. Our regular P.E. teacher was extra nice.

I was at my friend's house and we were working on some sort of difficult long-lasting project which we never seemed to finish.

I don't remember the first part of the dream. But I remember the end. I was at my circus class, and they needed three people between 90-120 lbs. I was one chosen.

We held waists, then jumped from the platform thing. We floated gently down, then slammed onto the teterboard (a circus apparatus) and catapulted the person on the other end into the air (Bill). Then, we floated up again, into the air, and flew slowly, barely missing hitting Sandy and Alexis (my contortion partners) and landed smoothly on a crash mat.

I was at Hashy camp in Australia, and we were going to do this activity called the field game. It was freezing cold so Adam and I went into our dark room, to change. We tried to turn on the lights, but there was no switch that we could find. There were a bunch of weird things that we tried to switch, but the best we did was dimming green lights around the room. The problem? They only stayed dimmed. One time, I tried to find a switch and by accident rubbed my hand over some wires. I thought I would get electrocuted, but I didn't. I finally got changed in the dark. The game started by this boy catapulting a big stone off a cliff, and these big men had to hold him back from falling off the cliff.
Setting: Hashy camp, out of Melbourne, Australia.
Characters: My brother - not very helpful, usually.

First of all, I somehow turned into a bee. I don't know how, but I did. Someone else that I can't remember did too. We were at the zoo, and were flying around and landed on a bench, right in front of the gorillas. I wanted to fly around some more, but whoever was with me told me to watch out for the plastic balls that they were throwing around. The other bee flew around, once to show me, but did get hit by a ball. I flew over, and saw that it was close to being dead. It didn't really mind, though, and talked about how cool it was to have a huge stinger, and told me to get a toothpick. I didn't, so it told me the only way to get us back to normal people was to make the noises like the gorillas. I did, and it worked. We picked up frisbees at the souvenir shop going out of the zoo. When I got home this thing like in the arrival - one that spins around and creates a whirlpool - type-thing and then makes everything into nothing, was in my house, and started. For some reason I wasn't scared at all and just sat there. It didn't harm me at all, but I threw my frisbee in (I don't know why).
Setting: At the zoo and my house.
Characters: The other bee - I don't know as a person or a bee, unafraid. No one else, except for I saw the Arrival, not too long ago.
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, excited, didn't care. Probably the strangest one ever, but it was cool that I saw from a bee's perspective. In science we watched a film on animal behavior including things on bees.

First, me and Courtlyn were at this store. For some reason we couldn't go past this certain point that I wanted to go past. Then we went to her house, but it wasn't her current house, it was a huge mansion. I remember baking something sweet. Later that day, I went back to the same store with Sandy, Lynne, Claire and Brian. We did go into the part that I really wanted to go, but it wasn't all that exciting after all. But it was still pretty good. We all had bags, so we played "find the bag." I hid my bag behind a counter, but no one else had hidden theirs yet. Then Lynne went behind the counter and hid her bag there too, but she didn't see mine. Instead, she started babbling/shouting on and on about how it was the best hiding place. Brian, Claire, Sandy and I heard, but none of us went to find hers there.
Setting: In a big store and a big mansion.
Characters: I know Brian, Lynne, and Claire, but not very well. Sandy and Courtlyn are my really good friends. I can picture myself at a big store with them, but not with Brian, Lynne or Claire.

I was staying with Patrick for the summer. It wasn't his house, though. It was way out in the middle of nowhere, and his parents weren't around. He could drive (he backed out of the driveway at 50 mph), but we both rode mountain bikes to some dimly lit store where he wanted to buy a wooden model airplane. It was a long dream, but in most of it I seemed to be changing clothes. I would just get out of bed and change from sleepwear to normal clothes, or vice versa. I had a broken leg.
Setting: At some old house that I've never seen, but that I thought of as Patrick's, and at a dim store.
Characters: Patrick, my 15-year old cousin, lives in a small town in Missouri. He wrestles, plays in the marching band, and has a broken leg. His leg was broken in a wrestling match when the other guy didn't stop when the referee blew the whistle.

I was embarrassed about changing in front of my friend yesterday. I rode bikes with a friend yesterday. Also, yesterday I thought about driving for a while. It was a very long dream.

It's hard to recall now. I was with a friend, and we were walking around an unknown city. People kept asking me "what I was wearing," and Charla walked up to me and asked where I had gotten my CDs. One was Fugees. My friend and I kept passing this movie theater, and I knew it was a dream because I couldn't read anything. A bunch of people walked out because the animated characters moved throughout the building. I saw this incredibly good-looking guy with a silver, a gold and a blue lip stud. He went inside, but my friend said he'd meet me behind the gold curtain. When I went there, there were naked people changing. The guy at the counter said I had a phone call, but we got disconnected.
Setting: A strange city, and mostly in and around a movie theater.
Characters: I think the friend was Leah, one of my classmates. Carla is my music/drama/dance teacher. I don't know the cute guy, but he was older, 15 or 16.

I was in my room making outfits any everything, with some guy helping me, and the next thing I know I was in my yard at 9:00 a.m. drowning in the rain with my best friend. A car went by and my friend said that was her mom, so we better get inside and get ready to go. She started really shivering so I said fine. We tried to grab all the paper. She ran inside with a bunch of scraps of paper, well I tried to get the rest. Then my mom and dad pulled in so I ran inside and my sisters were on the couch and we started talking. Then I noticed there was muddy paw prints from my dog going up the stairs. So I thought I have to go clean it.
Setting: At my house, and outside in my driveway at 9:00 in the rain.
Characters: Some guy who was helping me with outfits, white, nice, I think he was my cousin. Then my best friend and me and my two sisters.

I was at a mall and there was a group of kids. One girl and a bunch of guys surrounding her. I was in a jumper outfit (I hate jumpers) and I had this huge ball which I kept throwing in the air and I would go after it and fall over (I was a klutz). Then my sister came along and we skipped around. Then I was at this hotel in the woods and I walk around the side and it looks like our patio, except enlarged. There's a bench overlooking a creek. There's a full moon and my swim coach is on the bench whistling (he always whistles). That's all I remember.
Setting: First at an outdoor mall like in Nebraska or something. Then a hotel or something with a patio and a creek.
Characters: This popular pretty white girl, four guys, and me - a girly klutz. Also my swim coach, a 70 year old guy.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy yet stupid, pitiful, dorkish. I was such a klutz and a baby. My coach whistling on like my back porch in the middle of nowhere. It was another bizarre dream.

They all got out when they saw me. He was leaning on the front driver's side door. He looked at me and said, "Look at my new car." It looked like a 'vette, but it wasn't. He had left his window open and a weird guy (a person I don't know) jumped through the window and tried to steal the car. But I jumped through the car window and landed in the front passenger's side. I tried to stop him but he kept going. Then I managed to take the keys. I turned around the car and and to the weird guy's home. Then I drove to my crushes house and parked the car.

Bay Area girls: Grades 7-9:#430-01 (7th grader, 11/18/96)

I was with my advisor (who is male) and we had just gotten back from a play/movie (I don't remember) and were in the Mark Antony Hotel (we stayed there in early October when the 7th and 8th grade went to Ashland, Oregon), and we had been discussing the way I present myself sexually, and how that makes others feel. Then we both got into bed (the same bed), and cuddled, like he might do with someone his age, and I am unclear if anything sexual happened after that, but if it did I remember he didn't think it was a big deal, and I was worried about what other people would think. But he made me feel relaxed. My brother was in the dream at the end.
Setting: Mostly in the Mark Antony Hotel, in a room I recognized as one I had stayed in before.
Characters: My advisor (I will leave out his name), who acted laid-back, and relaxed like he always is in real life. I think my brother appeared in the very end. He is 10, short, and looked like himself. I was also in it and for the most part I saw the dream through my eyes, though part of it I could see from 3rd person (perspective).
Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Unsure about what I was doing, worried that other people would think I'm weird for sleeping with my advisor, relaxed because he though it was okay, uncomfortable because I'd never done it before, friendship and respect because my advisor is my friend and I have respect for him, I guess. (I've made it sound like it was awful, but it was really a nice dream and I enjoyed it.)

I drove in my friend Chloe's car and her mom dropped us off on some unrecognizable road. Chloe, another friend, and I played on the street for a while, then rollerbladed (or maybe ice skated) to like a movie theater/bar/disco. The movie playing was a horror movie. As I left walked through the bar into the disco. Chloe and Robin eventually joined me, then Chloe's mom picked us up again, and dropped us off at the road we'd started on. We then discovered that one of the houses on the block belonged to our principal. Then we stole a bottle of Peach Nectarine sparkling juice that was outside his house, drank most of it...I can't remember past there...
Setting: First on a suburban road I didn't recognize, then in a movie theater, a bar, and a disco.
Characters: My friend Chloe, my friend Robin, Chloe's mom, and maybe my principal, though I'm not sue he actually made an appearance; oh, yes, and a guy named Atum who appeared very briefly.
Feelings and Thoughts: I don't remember. I think it's a little odd that we were stealing sparkling juice from the principal, but it doesn't surprise me that we were trying to be stupid and rebellious.

Most of the dream I can't remember. I think I had been on a camping trip, and on the way back we stopped in something like the Star Dome; I lifted up the flap of this big rubber star shaped thing, and inside I saw what I thought were three bats. When I got out, I think I remember being back on the camping trip, in a place similar to a camp site we stayed aton a camping trip I took with my dad. Now, everything after that is a blur, but I seem to remember some man (who I think represented my father, though didn't look quite like him) being shot, and as some police man dragged him off he handed me a strawberry smoothie. I also remember meeting with the 7-8th girls, but I don't know where or why.
Setting: Inside something that was star-shaped, and made of rubber, blown up like a balloon; some parking lot, unrecognizable.
Characters: There were three bats with red eyes; I think my friend Chloe got in there (she went camping with us this summer); some man who I think represented my dad; the My school 7th-8th girls.
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, shocked. Bats and camping are a little weird, but I think seeing my father shot (which probably came from some movie I watched) is a little disturbing. What could it symbolize? Nothing, I hope.

All I remember is being a caterpillar (I think I was male, because I remember coming "home from work" and finding my wife already there). We were in a cherry tree. The first dream I can only remember hugging a fairly young boy, and his two older brothers saying something along the lines of "Don't become too attached." The dream after (before the caterpillars) I as in the Nature Company store, or maybe a science museum gift shop.
Setting: In a cherry tree; I don't remember the next one; in a museum gift shop.
Characters: My caterpillar wife; a boy of about 10; his older brothers of about 16-17 (I recognized none of them). I think I saw Anna (an 8th grade girl at My school).
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, surprised. The dream I wrote down second is the one that interests me the most. I know there was more to it, and it was a lot more complicated, but my mind just moved on to the caterpillar home.

I dreamt I was lying in the snow in Alaska and was having seizures and nobody was coming to help me. That's because I realized in my dream that I was actually in my bed. In my dream, I was dreaming. (In real life, when I woke up, I found I had a fever of 102 degrees and was chilled. I was having violent convulsions and my throat was dry from coughing. My head was bleeding because I hit my head on the bedside table during one of my convulsions. Nobody had come to help me.)
Setting: In my bed, in my home.
Characters: It was only me.
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, sick, alone. I have no idea where it came from, but I think my mind was just reacting to my body movements in my sleep.

I was lying on my bed in my room, but everything in my room was on fire. I couldn't get my covers off me and my vision started to blur. I saw my great-grandmother coming through the fire to get to me and take me up to Heaven with her. I walked to the door where she was. Then I was whizzing through a tunnel with her while a golden light was pulling us on. I loved it. (Real: when I woke up my mom was shaking me and she said that I hadn't been breathing and she couldn't find a pulse on me.)
Setting: First in my bed, then through a gray tunnel that was really windy.
Characters: My great-grandmother was in my dream to take me to Heaven.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy when I saw my great-grandmother; scared my room was on fire; relaxed & excited in the tunnel. I think I might have had a "near-death" experience. When I woke up I wanted to go back to the golden light and my great grandmother. I have always wanted to meet her and I finally got to. But now that I think about it, I almost died. This strengthens my faith in God even more, because now I know that he wants me to live even just a little while longer. My fever was 105 degrees when I woke up.

I had just spent the night over at my best friend's house and we were waking up on a gorgeous spring morning. She had to go to school, but I didn't, so I wanted to go with her. She lives less than a block away from her school, and I was jealous that she could wake up at 7:30 and make it to school by 8. I was shaving my legs with her electric razor and then we went into her back yard and went swimming in the cool water.
Setting: At my friend's house.
Characters: My best friend.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed, refreshed. I think I want all this rain to stop and I want it to be spring. I LOVE spring!

It was like watching a cartoon show. There was this guy and he left home & met a girl, but she didn't like him all that much. He was pretty stupid. Back home his little sis (about 5 years old) & his parents are watching a movie. The parents were sitting on her to keep her quiet. All I saw was their butts and her head & shoulders. She was squirming and when she finally got her head out she yelled something like "(brother's name) got out of the house and is running around with a girl!" Then back to the girl & guy. They suddenly had a fat guy friend with them. They did some stuff, but all I remember is a scene with the guy on a pay phone in a hotel with the other two standing around. The girl got mad and walked away. The guy dropped the phone and followed. There was more but I don't remember it.
Setting: All different places, but I didn't recognize them.
Characters: I don't know any of the people.

I was going to fence someone but all of the swords didn't have long blades. I asked some buy to fence and he turned out to be my friend's brother. We were talking and he told me he was taking calculus XZ. Then he smiled at me and I think I liked him. He said two nice things to me and said something about the difference in our age. Then he said, "You aren't using my sister to get to me?" I said no and he said, "I don't want my sister to get hurt." Before that, we were at camp and assigned to jobs before the feast. I went downstairs to this beach; someone was telling me about how people died in a volcano here. It reminded me of Mt. Vesuvius. Then me & Jeanette went down a dark road in a car to go grocery shopping even though it wasn't my job. Then I went down stairs to the boys school where my old crush R. went to school. I was looking for him but I couldn't find him.
Setting: At camp, at a beach, in Woodside, at an all-boys school.
Characters: Frank & R. Both were ex-crushes I had decided that I didn't like any more the night I had the dream. The two girls are my friends. I didn't know who the other person was. Frank looked different than he normally does. I met him like I met my current crush, Eli.
Feelings and Thoughts: Anxious, in love, happy, sad. I woke up thinking Frank loved me until I remembered it was only a dream. I was scared when the person told me the people had died in the year 226.

I went to school and we were doing Drama. Steve asked me, Melissa and Liz to sing in front of everybody. I don't like sitting in front of people so I sort of mouthed it: Then Steve, the Director, said Great! Liz, you're cast as Juliet, Melissa, you're cast as Lady Capulet, and Kelly, you're cast as the nurse. I felt cheated. I cried and said "I never even auditioned for the parts." Steve said that Melissa could sing the song in the play. I didn't even want the part of the nurse. I wanted Juliet.
Setting: It took place at the stage (where) we usually had our performing night at school. It also took place at school.
Characters: Steve is the director and the middle school head, and plays heavy favorites. Liz is a really popular "strong" actress, she never fells (sic) the parts. Melissa is a really homely person who is Steve's favorite and Carol is an okay actress. Liz is Steve's (illegible).
Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, sad, cheated, mad. I felt sad that I never got a chance and Steve would cast me as the part I wanted no matter now good I was.

We went to a restaurant like we always do on Sundays with my parents. Then Mrs. H. came up to me and told me and Courtney that I needed to get measured for the wedding. She said Alessandra, Monique de Brian would measure us. Monique had this weird measuring device like a stick that she put over Courtney's chest. Then Monique was hitting a ball with a piece of metal from her sword. I tried doing that by throwing it but I couldn't. Then Saul made me bend my knees and make sure my arm was above my lets. Then I threw the rock really far into a pile of rocks. Then I was walking down a big mossy step to this guy I knew from somewhere. Then I talked with Courtney and Melissa about my school. I was visiting there and Linda came up to me. I had to tell R. than you for something. Then Courtney said that she didn't want to go to my school because the female admissions director had been mean to her. Then the scene played again, and I saw what happened: It was strange. The I went to Burlingame Avenue with 2 people from my school, and went into a gourmet food store that sold Margaritas. The other stores didn't, even though they had displays up telling people they did. Then the crackers started bouncing up and down in a strange order. I wanted the garlic and cheese ones. Monique said she had been fencing since she was 3, then 2 1/2. While she was measuring me, Jacob, and Patty, his wife, gave us a (illegible) about something confusing but it was supposed to be about love.
Setting: school, I am applying to. At a gourmet food store. Strange building. Funny building.
Characters: Monique de Brian is a really excellent World Cup fencer. Jacob is my teacher. The admissions director from school - who is actually a man. The boy - a kid from church. Lorna, a 9th grader. Courtney & Melissa, school friends.

I was at My school but it didn't look like My school. Stuff happened that I can't remember. The me and a few other friends went to the classroom next to where were sleeping. It looked like classroom 2 at school, but had more stuff in it. My friend A. said that tequila tastes good with tortillas. I didn't find this at all strange. So we go into the classroom and ask if there are any tortillas. They say no but that there is pita bread, so we go in there and everyone else disappears. We look under the sink, which isn't in classroom 2 really, and underneath are big jugs (those square kind that cleaning stuff comes in) and they are kind of see-through and there is yellow-whitish liquid inside. On them they say something I don't remember. Anyway we pour the tequila into margarita glasses and eat it with pita bread. Some stuff happens. (I think that it has gotten later but I'm not sure.) An elderly black man comes in and says he has to check us. We immediately think he's talking about us drinking tequila. I'm the type who would break down and tell everything we were doing. I look, about to laugh at this black girl to my right (A.'s on my left). She put her long dark red nails in her mouth (a normal gesture as if biting her nails), and leans her head down and tells me no (don't tell). The man goes and checks behind a mirror inside a mirror like the illustration. Behind, there are some photos. Inside were the photos that showed the snake that bit one of the teachers. This was a big mystery, solved. Then we went away. I think later there was a big commotion with the teacher who had been bit.
Setting: At my school. Everything was kind of the same but a little changed.
Characters: My friend A. Schoolmates, kind a generic "classmates" - didn't know them. The black guy was mysterious. The black girl was the only person I recognized and communicated with other than my friend A., and one man.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. It was very weird but I told my mom I smoked marijuana once and maybe the tequila is related.

I was with my family. We went to buy something at a store and I found this CD I kind of wanted so I put it in a bag. Then I tried on these ugly rainbow-colored shoes. I put these in a bag. Later, we're driving and I see that I have stolen both these things, which I didn't mean to do. Then we see some black gangsters fighting and my mom sighs, "please don't start." Then they start punching people out and Tupac gets rolled in front of our car & starts screaming something at us.
Setting: In a shoe/CD store. Also on a street from a car-windshield point of view.
Characters: My family in the dream was just a generic family, I don't know them. Tupac is a famous rapper who died. He had some good songs. The gangsters were random, but one was Snoop Doggy Dog (also a famous rapper but he's alive).
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, indifferent. Well, yesterday I was looking at pictures of Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac. Even though in my dream Tupac looked nothing like Tupac, Snoop Doggy Dogg looked the same.

I was in a classroom with the rest of my class (8th grade). Steve, our teacher and principal, was calling up, one by one, the people with long hair and cutting their hair so that it was about jawbone length. I was the last person to be called up. I ran away and tucked my hair into my sweatshirt so that it looked like I had short hair already. Everybody looked at me like I was just being stupid, so I went over to Steve. I had to keep telling him not to cut it so short. It seemed like he finally cut it just above shoulder length. Then I was at home and looking in the mirror in my room. My hair was just below shoulder length. I wondered for about 20 seconds about why he had cut it shorter. I figured I just didn't see where Steve cut my hair. Then I noticed that my hair looked good at this length and looked at the mirror for a while.
Setting: Most of it took place in the classroom at my school. Some of it took place in my room.
Characters: Steve Smuin is my teacher and the school principal. My whole class, the whole 8th grade, was in the dream. I know them all.
Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried, surprised. I felt like this really happened. One weird thing that I just realized is that my hair in the dream was straight, smooth, shiny. This wasn't really out of the ordinary. If it weren't for the hair-cutting, I wouldn't even have noticed it as a dream, not a memory. The feelings I had were really normal for being at my school.

But then I looked further up and Melissa & Hillary were there. The aliens had been imitating them. We went onto the launch & after we had taken off, they told us we had too many people. We had to choose the one to go. We chose Emily because she didn't hear us. Someone gave her an Orio and said he wanted to record exactly how she ate it. She willingly took one cookie and described it as she went along. She pulled it apart and said she had to lick the cream filling first, and then she ate the outside. Immediately after eating it, she looked at her arm and it started to turn green with red splotches, just like the aliens. She was pretty angry at us for tricking her. I somehow became their leader and one day I got so stressed out that I went for a walk and swim in a gorgeous little pond. After my swim, I went down to some sort of store and outside was a man.

Remember loose bear. My class was having a party in the same building they film either Star Wars or Star Trek, and we were going to sleep over. Our photography teacher was there and when the rest of the class was off doing something, I talked with Jan and he basically told me that he was homeless. After I talked with him I went to find a place to sleep. I went up to the loft and I saw Diana holding on to the top of her rolled up sleeping bag when it was vertical. Then it just fell over and I thought she could only do that because it was her birthday. I decided not to sleep in the loft because I would be so separated. There was a bear chained down in a room and after I looked in the loft, I looked under the wall to bear's room and I saw a bear foot chained down. I poked my head all the way through and the bear was gone. Steve was with me and picked up a rifle and I told him not to and he just scoffed at me. I picked up a rifle, then said, "OK, fine." I also picked up a handgun and ran out shouting that there was a loose bear. I ran into the room and they were filming Star _____ and shouted the warning and everyone panicked. I said, "Use only tranquilizer darts." Steve said, "Yeah, right."
Setting: An old warehouse.

When it started we were at some sort of party. All the kids from my class were there, although I didn't see them all. I just knew they were there. All the teachers were there too. I can't remember what went on for a while, but then Steve told Melissa to share what happened to her. She said, "No, that's all right. I don't really have to." Steve and Todd told her she had to. So she told everyone she passed her math exam and everyone applauded. The somehow it was Nina who had told the news, and tears came to her eyes and she went running to the bathroom, and Courtney and I followed. When we got there, she had locked herself in the stall. I said, "Nina, why are you crying? You passed your math exam!" And she said, "Get away from me, you fat, ugly bitch." Anne had also come in the bathroom in time to hear this, and she walked to the stall, unlocked it, and went in. Then Julia went in too. I don't remember what happened, but a lot of the 7th graders came in, including Anna. For some reason we were throwing a tomato around the room and it bounced off Anna's shoulder. She was worried that she'd smashed it, but Nina said, "Don't worry, you're not fat like Hilary." I can't remember what happened after that. I think I woke up, but the dream continued for a minute, then changed.
Setting: At my school, and my school bathroom.
Characters: Nina & Melissa, two of my best friends. Todd, my math/science teacher. Anne & Julia, two really good friends. Steve, my advisor, head of the school. Courtney, a friend of Anna, my "little sister" (at school, 8th graders get a 7th grade "sibling" to help them adjust to middle school).
Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried, concern. When Nina said I was a fat, ugly bitch, I was hurt and angry, but I didn't show it. Melissa really did pass her math test, and they told the entire 7th and 8th grades (it was an accomplishment for her because in two years she's never passed a math test, so they wanted to acknowledge her work).

I went out of the room, went outside at the bottom of a hill, and Julia came down too because there wasn't enough room where all the girls were. Somehow there was a round table set up out there, so we were writing on it. Then Evan called out a window, "Do you think we could bring that table up here?"

I hardly remember anything so I'll just write about the bits I do remember. I remember looking for something and going up a hill to look for it and sliding back down it and slamming into a wall. I remember many houses along a street and the kids in the houses were falling in love with each other and sneaking through woods to see each other. I also remember a man who had been tricked into getting really mad, and while the town was in a circle having some kind of meeting, he lassoed them. And then he was never forgiven what he did. I think the person who tricked him was a woman. Soon the dream made more sense. I was racing through the woods with my younger sister and a whole bunch of other kids. Suddenly, I started moving my legs weirdly and I started to fly. Soon I had a balloon in one hand, my sister's hand in the other, two books under my arms, and I was flying above the treetops. I did not win the race but I did learn how to fly. When I got there, there was an adult who was surprised that I could lift off the ground with only two balloons (my sister was holding one). I also remember a poor family that lived in a big house that came from a warmer north.
Setting: In the country with lots of woods and a lake nearby.
Characters: There was the person I was searching with, the mad man, the tricky woman, the townspeople, the other kids, my little sister, the lady with balloons, and the people from the north.
Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, excited. (Angry) when I ran into the wall and the man was being treated badly. I also felt excited when I started to fly.

I had just finished swim practice and I was going to get a ride home with my friend but the car was full so I biked home. I had done it many times before but at this one street I couldn't remember which way to go. I would choose one way, ride on it for a while, then turn back when I realized it wouldn't take me home.

Setting: All over San Francisco.

I was a dog and I was running around in someone's backyard for a while. Then this guy came out (I was with my two other dog friends) and started chasing us.

I had to go scrub walls as a punishment.

I was in a swimming pool with Julia and Erin, and there was dirt on the ground of the pool, so when you swam across the middle you weren't allowed to put your feet on the ground. These guys were diving for a lid to a drink, and they had to pick it up with their mouths. Suddenly, my drama teacher was there and she made us turn around and not look as they dived for it so as not to embarrass them or something. That's what she does in the dance class during exams, when we have to make up a dance she makes everyone turn around so the person won't be embarrassed.
Setting: In a pool.
Characters: I'm sure Julia was there, plus Erin and my drama teacher and two guys. I didn't interact very much with the two characters, they just kind of followed me around.
Feelings and Thoughts: Mellow. I had a fight with my mom yesterday. Julia was really supportive and nice 'cause I was upset. Maybe that's why she was in the dream.

I was an Indian on a reservation but it was also a ski resort. All day we went up and down the mountain. There was a border which was marking white man's land. There was a bathroom right across it. I really had to go so I did. Because I trespassed I started this whole war, and the whites started invading and attacking us. It was cold, and I managed to get a fire started to keep warm, and all the Indians were huddled around it while the whites moved closer and closer in on us.

All I remember is the end of the dream: I was at a typical My school party, out on one of our many lawns, eating little sandwiches, and little cookies, and drinking tea, on a fairly cheerful Sunday afternoon.

I was doing a play, and we did lots of improv work. I think it was a school play, though it seemed like an acting camp I went to over the summer. Then we were doing the play, and the music was all off, so we had to improvise in front of the audience.

Setting: In a theater, and backstage.
Characters: summer camp actors; Olive, my worst enemy.

Me and my brother Max were swimming in the ocean. I jumped off a cliff to join him, and we decided we'd stay there overnight. So then we had to go to higher ground, and we hiked up a bunch of hills as the sun was setting (it was really pretty), then found a cabin we could stay in, that nobody else was using.

I went to summer camp, met a girl who liked my straightforwardness, and she gave me some false eyelashes. I remember thinking I'd forgotten all my hair products. Then I saw a little boy being beat up, so I went over to one of the guys and told him he was a fuck-up. He then asked me if I wanted my head twisted off, and got really pissed. So I told him he had misunderstood my comment, and what I really said was "I wanna fuck you up." So he changed his mind and fell in love with me, and we did this dancing-flying kind of thing. After we did this, I accidentally let go and flew into another room, and changed into a twin of the man in there. Then there was something in there about Dorothy/Judy Garland, but I don't remember. I don't remember the ending.
Setting: A summer camp (I'm not sure when/where).
Characters: The first girl who I don't know; the little boy I didn't know either; the guy I eventually fell in love with looked a lot like my friend's older brother; the las man and/or Judy Garland seemed familiar.

Characters: Glenn, Anna, Robin and/or other person.

Bay Area girls: Grades 7-9:#606-04 (9th grader, 01/26/97)

The first part of the dream I was with a bunch of friends and we felt like doing something stupid and rebellious, but we figured we'd better have my other friend Sally along. Since nobody else knew the way to her house, I drove. Eventually we just sat around talking, eating cookies, and making scrap-books in the middle of the night, up in Sally's loft. I had some mini-dream about being in a computer game. Me and my family and family friends went to this Club Med, and they were all a part of the Club Med circus team, and they wanted me to do the trapeze. I'm an acrophobic, so they couldn't get me to do it. Right at the end of my dreams, Whitney Houston sang "I will always love you."
Setting: In a car along some fairly busy road; Sally's house/loft; in some sort of computer game; at a Club Med with a 50-foot flying trapeze.
Characters: A bunch of friends, though I distinctly remember Jon, Sally and Brian; nobody in the computer dream; my brother and mom I don't quite remember, but my dad and his friend Joel, and his two daughters were definitely there, and the trapeze guy, and Whitney Houston.
Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, terrified. I know the trapeze thing must have come from when I asked my dad last night what "fear of heights" was and he said acrophobia. I think my brother was playing computer games like that. And I was listening to the radio last night so Whitney Houston probably came from there.

I got both of those.

We were going on a trip and I left my CD player in the house. I went back to get it and the piano was playing by itself. I tripped and fell and I saw someone in the living room. It was my dad but he scared the living daylights out of me. Then the scene changed and everyone was in the living room. Then my dad wanted to show me something upstairs. We went upstairs into my bathroom. It was different because there was a place where a light bulb should be above the bathtub and there weren't any shells on the shelf. My dad said there was this voice that gave him nightmares and was in them. He said it came from here. I told him to tell it to laugh and it did. It was the scariest laugh I've ever heard. But I wasn't scared for some reason and I just yelled back at it. I tried to find where it was coming from and it was coming from the heater. I tried to rip up the heater but it was too hot. Then my dad said it was the ghost of a football coach. The I woke up really freaked out.
Setting: My house.
Characters: My family - same as always.
Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, freaked out. It was a really scary nightmare.

I was with my fencing class and we were on a retreat with some of my friends. I kept on asking why Eli was being so mean to me. Everyone said he was stressed about colleges. We had to do posters of people's qualities and Linda showed us two ways to do them. I was going to do Eli and then apologize to him. I asked him how to spell his name even though I hoped he wouldn't know I was doing him. He answered "Greuff/m." We were by the ocean on a narrow trail. I wanted to tell him how I felt but he had left. Then we were back at the gym. My friend Gia was there and she was in a green skating dress. Linda tried to describe how Gia was skating a special part in our show. Then she asked who Evita was and then she explained who she was. Gia thought she was the Embassy Suites and I knew who she was, but I couldn't seem to say it. Then the gym turned into a skating rink and everyone started skating around. Gia raised her leg and did a spiral.

I am on a trip to Italy with a lot of my friends and their families. I am thoroughly frustrated because most of the girls on the trip are my age and most of the boys are juniors and seniors. All the girls are acting slutty and fake and all the boys are buying it. I like Albert and he keeps being stolen away by a group of slutty girls. Everyone is ignoring me. So that night (in my dream), I just cried myself to sleep. I remember there being about 100 twin size beds just lined up against the walls. There was one room for the adults and one room for the kids. Everyone was talking loudly and having fun and no one noticed me crying. I am woken in the middle of the night (in my dream) to find Albert sitting on the edge of my bed. I remember seeing his deep blue eyes and they shone in the moonlight. I also remember looking around and seeing all the 100 beds completely empty. So then Albert leaned down and just kissed me really innocently and sweetly. But then there was a knock on the door so he pulled away and looked really afraid. He said, "I'll come back later" and left. Then I woke up because my mother really was knocking on my door to wake me up. (230 words)

I'm in this elevator with Nick and Aidan. We are in the main building and for some reason we are taking the elevator down to the dining hall. So all of a sudden it stops really quickly and I fall to my knees and am perfectly waist level with both of them. So for some odd reason I think that they want me to give them head and I am really embarrassed so I stand up very quickly. When we reach the dining hall, it's packed with the entire school and then some. So Nick, Aidan, and I get out of the elevator. I'm walking towards the front of the dining hall and Nick is following me, saying, "Hi Bea" and I want him to keep following me and I want to talk to him, but I keep getting pushed so I lose sight of him and then I wake up.

I dreamed that there was this war happening and that I was much more involved than I am in the war now In class we would have drills pertaining to the war. It was really scary. So all the freshmen and sophomores went on this trip and Sue and I were left behind. So when the trip returned everyone sought to create everyone's worst nightmare. All these people were chasing me and trying to shoot me, which I guess is my worst nightmare. I ran into my house, which was like the Order of the Phoenix in Harry Potter. Mr. Bailey was there with a palette of nail polish, trying to communicate some code to me. But I couldn't figure it out. So then I escaped to a kind of vineyard where Sue's worst fear was being realized. Her worst fear was that everyone had found out some secret about her. So there were all these freshmen and sophomores tormenting her in the trees of the vineyard, saying things like, "We know, Sue..." and then I remember one of them saying "We know about Abbylius," (I just made that name up in my dream) and then I woke up.

I dreamed that I was on this train. In each different car was a different song playing. And no matter how much I liked the song that was playing, I was forced into the next car. It was really hot in the train so I was wearing my bathing suit. The train stopped at my high school's dining hall. I went in and everyone was studying for exams. I sat down at a table with my friends in my bathing suit. Ashley came up behind Olivia and put a lobster in her hair and we all screamed. Then she came after me with another lobster, so I ran away. I finally got back to my table and grabbed my bags before heading back to my dorm. On the way I saw Matthew and David, but they ignored me. Frustrated, I parachuted (yes, parachuted) away. I was so scared of Olivia and angry that Matthew and David had ignored me. When I got to the dorm, I realized that it was the beginning of school, even though I had just seen everyone studying for final exams. I realized I didn't live here anymore, so then I rushed to my new dorm where I found Sue. She told me that she, Hannah, 3 other girls, and I all shared a room in Bundy. When I got inside, I saw Hannah rearranging the furniture in a way-too-small room for 6 girls. I remember being furious that Hannah and I had to share a room with 4 other girls on Bundy 1, where all of Ms. Prong's favorite varsity athletes lived. I thought there had to be some mistake. I went to the closet to put my stuff there and realized that I had left all my clothes somewhere else. I ran back to the dining hall to look for them. All the doors were locked and I remember looking in the windows and seeing everyone in there being gassed to death. I remember seeing my father and Albert slowly dying. For some reason this didn't bother me at all and I rushed back to my room to find all my roommates playing name games, even though we already all knew each other. My other roommates' names were Brianna, Susan, and Kaylee. I was so frustrated I didn't have clothes, so I borrowed some from Hannah. Then I did have to take exams and I woke up. (403 words)

So I dreamed that it was May again and everyone was playing Assassin as usual. Only the whole school was divided into houses like in Harry Potter, and only the Slytherins could kill the Gryffindors, and I was in Gryffindor and couldn't kill anyone. The only way you wouldn't be killed is if you were caught with $10 and your school ID. So I was walking down the main hallway and James Franco, who was in Slytherin, killed me. But then I showed him my ID card and $10. But for some reason this didn't matter to him, and he took my money and ID card. So then I went to the library and Anthony was there. He was in Gryffindor too and he studied there for exams since it was the end of the year again. We were also hiding from the Slytherins. They were like the High Inquisitorial Squad from Harry Potter too. Anthony and I were studying, but we had a question about math, so we went to find Mr. Stipps, who was in his office blow-drying sour milk out of his hair. He was really mad that we saw him blow-drying his hair and threatened not to give us any more DVDs or help if we continued to stand there. So Anthony and I left. I went to see Hannah and Sue in Bundy and Anthony went to Langton. When I got to Hannah's room, she told me that Mrs. Frank had called and wanted me to babysit her children the next evening. She said I shouldn't because the next evening was the dance. So I picked up the phone to call the Franks to tell them I couldn't babysit, but as soon as I went to dial the number, a woman's voice came over the receiver and said I couldn't dial. I ran to Sue's room to use her phone, but the woman's voice came over her phone too. So I then went to each room on the floor but all the lines were tapped. I finally went to the last room to dial before the woman figured out that I was using that phone. But I couldn't dial the number because all the numbers had been rearranged and I couldn't find the proper ones. I ran all the way down to Houk to use the phones there. But when I got there the whole building was on fire. Everyone was carrying furniture out of the burning dorm. It didn't occur to me that this was weird, people going back into a burning building. There was a plate of treats for everyone who carried furniture out of the building. I started to go back to Bundy, but my legs were so weak I could barely stand. I kept stumbling up to Bundy. When I reached the small parking lot between Langton and Slate, I saw Hannah's dad in a car and he nearly ran me over. I kept trying to get up to Bundy. When I finally got there though, Mrs. Frank and her two sons were all waiting for me. Apparently they were a day early. Mrs. Frank told me not to listen to Seth no matter what he said, and I was so confused I woke up. (544 words)

I had a really scary dream that I went to see the movie 28 Days Later, which is supposed to be a scary movie about everyone getting a plague. So I was watching the movie in the basement of a factory or something. All the people I was watching it with got the plague from the movie. I got so scared and ran to my brother's room. He was there and we sat in his room and we were listening to Harry Potter on tape, but then he got the plague too! It was horrible. (95 words)

I dreamed that we were all going on a field trip. We were all organized into different buses and Sue and I were put on a bus with a lot of people we didn't know at all. So we were really frustrated. When we got off the buses we had to take out our English exam. I remember we were in this huge dark metal room underground. We were able to get our results the minute we finished the exam. But when I finished I couldn't get to where my results were. Then I remember beginning a new dream where someone was chasing me in the dark metal room, but then I woke up. (114 words)

I dreamed that Alexis and I were in this cooking show like 30 years from now because everything was really high-tech and modern. We were cooking something and all of a sudden 100 male strippers jumped out and started stripping. It was really weird though because Alexis and I wanted to leave really badly so we started looking for the exit. The woman who directed the cooking show was mean and scary and wouldn't let us leave until we had shelved all the cans that were all over the ground. And then we had to organize them alphabetically. So we started. Then one of the guys came up to us and said he would let us out if we helped him make dinner. So we tried to help him make dinner, but we couldn't for some reason. Then the cooking studio turned into sand and flames, a beach bonfire in the middle of nowhere. Then I woke up. (158 words)

I had a dream that I was giving a tour of my high school. When I entered the chapel, it was pitch black and I could see nothing except for this little boy with a laptop. He jumped up to greet me and then launched into this discussion of wireless Internet on campus. He wanted to show me how it worked, so he turned some of the lights on really dim. I was shocked to see about 10 other people in the pews, all really old and like the boy with laptops. He went into all these programs and messed around on the computer until the lights shut off of their own accord, indicating that he was now connected to the Internet. I was surprised and impressed and had lost my tour. But it didn't bother me. I went downstairs to the mailroom to find everyone happy and excited, all carrying or eating candies and chocolates, all with roses and dressed in pink. They all said, "Happy Valentines Day" to me. I was surprised because I had no idea it was Valentines Day. It was really dark so I couldn't find my mailbox, yet I could see all my friends with their stuff. As I finally started opening my mailbox, Leah explained to me how much candy she had received and who had given her roses and such. I opened my box to find only 5 pieces of candy. Feeling rejected, I walked back upstairs where it was light again. I remember hearing this voice behind me calling my name, and I looked behind me to see Sam running toward me with one rose. He gave it to me and kissed my cheek before leaving. Puzzled, I went back to my dorm, where I fell asleep really quickly. I was woken late that night because the fire alarm rang. Hannah and I ran out of the room to a secret hallway I never new about before. We were all to wait there until a train picked us up to bring us to safety. So when the train finally came pirates who had stolen it controlled it. They kidnapped everyone but me. I had to run and hide in a nearby bathroom. When they came looking for me, I cut them with razors and sprayed their eyes with hairspray, and basically defeated them with beauty products (weird). Then I woke up. (400 words)

I dreamed that I was in a bookstore with my family. My brother and I found books about Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, but they weren't the real Harry Potter books. We got them anyway. When we were checking out, my mother found a bag containing more bags of jellybeans. She was asking the main who they belonged to. I wanted the jellybeans and quickly told her they were mind and that I had bought them earlier. When we returned to school, I went to Sophia and Sue's room. Sue, Alison, Hannah, Aidan, and Jayden were all there and we started trying to take Sophia's bed apart to find something. Everyone was positive that it was an antique, Chinese-made bed, and therefore I would be able to take it apart and put it back together. I started to remove the different wooden panels, but never found out what we were looking for and couldn't put the bed back together. Finally Jayden and Aidan found a piece of wood shaped like an elephant that held the whole bed together like some sort of puzzle. So then I went back to my bedroom at home and fell asleep. But then Jackson, who had climbed up the tree near the window by my bed and was asking me to come outside with him. I was scared and moved to my desk. But my computer had been swapped with someone else's, and I couldn't use this one. Then, somehow, Jackson took my bed to his room. Horrified, I grabbed on and was flying to his room on my bed. When I got there he began taking my bed apart so that I couldn't leave; however, I got away anyway. When I got back home, my computer was right where it was supposed to be. I signed onto AIM and promptly started talking to Bill about his sister's relationship with his best friend, Sam. Then Jon signed on and asked me for my phone number to call me. I gave it to him and literally within the next 30 seconds, the phone rang in real life and I debated getting up to pick it up or not. But then I woke up and realized that it wouldn't be Jon calling since it had all been a dream. (382 words)

Last night I dreamed that I was walking through this swamp/bog thing. As I was walking, I came across a set of 5 bunk beds, all stacked up on one another. There were people having sex and they wanted me to join them. But I didn't want to, so I dredged on through the mud. Then I saw Jayden and Aaron fishing for frogs. With them was Aidan. He asked me to prom, but I didn't even know that the prom was so close, so I just kept walking. I finally had come to the end of the swamp and there were the dorms. For some reason Bellah was following me for accepted students day or something. So I tried to find my dorm room, but it was completely impossible. Instead of the hallway with rooms was a HUGE ballroom and lots of small dark corridors. And I couldn't find my room! Finally after walking around forever, I found my room. Outside it was a stack of books and a balloon with my name on it. Bella and I went in but there was yet another huge room. In this one was a cooking show. Fritz (my dog) was trying to guess what kind of sandwich they were making and he got tickled every time he got it wrong. I guessed PB&J, got tickled, and woke up laughing! (228 words)

I had a dream that I was on a long trip. We were all on this bus and we finally stopped at campus. I needed to find an alarm clock so I would wake up in the morning. I searched all the dorms to find a faculty member who would have one. Finally I went to Langton and the Mings gave me one I could borrow. They led me through the dorm, onto different hallways, and into different rooms. In each room there was no alarm clock. I became frustrated and then went down to Houk to find an alarm clock there; however, when I got near the School Archives at my high school, all the electricity went out. Everything just shut down. The only people from my trip I could find were Jayden and Aaron. We all walked past the Main Building. I think we were going to my house to see if the bus was there. Anyway, we eventually found the bus and started going to another private boarding school in a really small town similar to ours. When we got to the school, we all went to the locker rooms to shower. I accidentally went into the boys' showers and they all wanted me to join them. I guess I kind of wanted to, but I was scared so I went to the girls' showers. They were all wearing their soccer uniforms, so I just wore mine too while I showered. The next day we had to take exams. Sue kept trying to copy off mine. Then for our history exam we had to see Pirates of the Caribbean. Then I woke up. (276 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#015 (07/21/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was in school and I had the absolute worst schedule. I had 8th period four days in a row and on Wednesdays and Saturdays I had all the periods. It was horrible. In Spanish, Sra. Perez made fun of me because I couldn't speak properly and I had to bathe Mr. Singer in history. When I went to English, I couldn't find my homework and I got into big trouble. I had 2 double chemistry labs a week and it was just turning out to be the worst school year ever. Finally, I went to math one day and it was the same class I had freshman year, except it was in an English classroom. The big projector was down and all the lights were off. Everyone was having sex and Anthony and Lou were there and they wanted me to have sex. But I was scared, so I went home for Thanksgiving break. I was at Sue's house and I went through this door outside. I was on a big mountain. Lord Voldemort had returned and was eating Thanksgiving dinner with us. No one else knew it was him, and for some reason, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else. On the mountain were Ron and Hermione, and Sue and I were throwing turkey to them to save everyone. But behind them were a lot of other bad people, so we were trying to get rid of them without hurting Ron and Hermione. Finally Ron and Hermione got up the mountain, and Lord Voldemort walked right by us. Sue understood and we both left because we were scared. We went to the lake because we had to try to take a boat back to my high school. So we started carrying out boats to the shore and ran into Mrs. Carter, who told us that my high school had moved to France. We ignored her and kept walking with our boats to the shore. We got into the water except we weren't in the boats. There were little kids in the boats and Isabel and I had to safely get them across the lake to my high school and away from Lord Voldemort. There was a fish that grabbed onto me and when I shook it off, it started to have babies. Then a snapping turtle chased us to land. Then I woke up. (399 words)

I had a dream that I was at my high school, but it was just like Hogwarts and was magical. Professor Dumbledore was the headmaster. I had been going there before Kylie came too. So we dueled, and Dumbledore was on my side telling me what to do because my wand was messed up. Finally it snapped in half and we all had to go to Diagon Alley to buy a new wand. On the train Kylie made fun of me for being blonde, even though I'm not. So I got mad and then she cursed me to death. Then I woke up. (103 words)

I dreamed that I was sitting at one of the picnic benches at soccer camp and Aaron and I were discussing Anna Karenina and he had two of the characters mixed up or something and I was really frustrated with him because I knew I was right. I had the book and started to look it up. Just then my mother drove to pick me up and I left him. Then suddenly it was the first day of school. I was in the history wing and Ed was trying to show me something. He was pulling me somewhere and out of the middle of nowhere, Wyatt wanted to show me something different, so he began to pull me in the opposite direction. It was chaos because for some reason, it was also Parents Weekend. There were people everywhere. In the middle of everything, Gwenyth Paltrow was singing out of the blue. I was so exhausted; I finally went to my dorm. On the way, I met someone who gave me a pancake they wanted me to feed to the Maples' dog. I took a bite of the pancake and it was really good. When I was near the science building, the dog came out of nowhere and began to bite me. I was so angry and scared that I ran to my room in Houk. My room was completely deserted except for a queen-sized bed in the middle, the room with my Laura Ashley sheets on them. There was a secret passageway into my real room where Maria and Zoey were getting dressed. I realized that my clothes were too small, so I had to borrow some of Maria's hideous clothes. Andrea was there too. I finally went back to the main building only to realize that I had no schedule. I couldn't figure out what classes I had. I searched everywhere and went to my mailbox to find it. Jessica came to me and told me that the teachers were trying something different; on the first day of school everyone would just go to their classes whenever they wanted just to see if they liked them. I went to English and then to history. In history, Mr. Singer brought us down to the soccer field where there was a car race. He lay down in the middle of the field and began squirting mayonnaise all over the place. Then he started reciting a speech of Abraham Lincoln's. No one found this weird though. Then I woke up.

I dreamed that I was spending some vacation with Gianna. She was living in this humungous house and her dad was really rich and worked for NASA. In one room there were a lot of beds all lined up against the wall. People were lying on the beds, and each had on a pair of shin guards. Underneath their shin guards were their stories and how they had been injured and why they were lying on these beds. Whenever Gianna or I lifted the shin guards to read the story, however, they woke up and started laughing at us. Then they made some sarcastic comment that was supposed to be satirical and making fun of a movie. Gianna and I realized that we were on the set of Scary Movie 3, and that's why everyone was making satirical comments. When we got to the last bed, a woman leapt out of nowhere and grabbed the shin guards away from us. She asked us if we had tried them on, and we said no. She then told us that it was a pair of deadly shin guards, and that whoever tried them on died the next day. Gianna and I went back to the main part of her house where a lot of maids were cleaning the tile floor. We started to watch a DVD before her dad came in and told us he had to leave again. Gianna was really upset. He got into this enormous truck and began to back out of the driveway before he began to fly and took off into the stars. Gianna and I went into another room where there was a fruit snacks factory. A large pipe would deposit fruit snacks into bags in short intervals. The pipe had been clogged and everyone was trying to fix it. Then this dream ended and I began another one where I was in Paris. Some friends and I were walking down a small street and spotted a good-looking cafe. We went inside and it turned out to be a sort of cafe/ice cream parlor/bakery/candy shop. We all went inside and tried to decide what to have. They had some of the weirdest candy, like "Antique M&Ms," where there was fruit inside the chocolate part. I went to go buy an ice cream cone, a coffee, and iced tea. I spilled the coffee as soon as I got it. Not wanting to pay for another. I filled it up with water and complained that they had given me water instead of coffee. They refilled it for me, and then I woke up. (435 words)

I had a dream that I was running around the main building looking for Anthony. I finally went to the auditorium to find him. I saw someone who looked like him very much. It was his father. He told me that Anthony was nervous to be around me because he knew that I liked him and he liked me too. A few minutes later, Anthony appeared looking a bit surprised to see me. I asked him why we hadn't seen each other lately and he didn't answer me. He said he was going to get changed and we could go for a walk. We took a walk down to the English wing, trying to find comfortable chairs to sit in. We saw people in their English classes and for some reason this was weird because it was supposed to be summer or something. We got to the end of the English wing and saw that the chapel was dimly lit. We went inside and saw Faith playing the violin. She left immediately as soon as Anthony and I got there. But she left her metronome on. I went to turn it off. Built into the metronome was some sort of sprinkler; when I went to turn it off, I got soaked. I told Anthony I was going into the little chapel loft to get undressed/changed. I crawled up there and went to a pew in the back and began to peel off my soggy clothes. Then I saw Anthony's face near the staircase and he came up and helped me get out of my wet clothes. Then he kissed me and I woke up. Then I dreamed that I was playing soccer and James Franco was the referee. He kept talking to me and teasing me until the game was over. Then I woke up again. (306 words)

I dreamed that I was at soccer camp and we were all in the room where we watch movies. It was pitch black and we were all soaking wet from the rain. All the coaches were outside the room choosing courses for us next year. I was getting really frustrated because I wanted to choose my own classes. I didn't want someone choosing them for me. The door opened and a little light crept in. I realized I was alone. Aidan came in to tell me what he had chosen for me to take. I was really upset because I didn't want to take the courses he selected. (108 words)

I first had a dream that Valerie and I were in this great big house with Brody. We were playing some sort of board game. I think maybe somewhere on the game there were sexual references or something, because very soon he was assaulting us. Valerie and I ran as fast as we could through the house, but he kept following us. Finally, I took off my belt and tried to whack him with it. Nothing happened. Valerie and I ran out of the house and into Mrs. Carter, who drove us to another house. Aidan and Jason were there and they saved Valerie and me. Then I had a new dream that there was a wedding at Sue's house. Everyone was dressed like Drew Barrymore in Ever After. All the kids, though, were playing games in the living room. I went in, and Sue, My brother, Ian, Claire, and Wyatt were there. We all started chatting and coloring until Mr. Bailey came in and announced that we all had to exercise, or something. He made Wyatt do 100 push-ups. I sneaked out to put my dress on, but it had gone. Then I woke up. (196 words)

I dreamed that I was in the snack bar. Everyone in there was fast asleep, so I attempted to sleep too. I remember I was in between Lou and Albert. Lou and I were talking, and then he started to kiss me. I was annoyed because I was pretty sure that he didn't think he was kissing me. I pushed him away but he kept kissing me. Then I left and had to be Santa's elf or something and help build the sleigh. Lou began to get sick, so I have him some cheese to help him feel better. We finally finished the sleigh, and then I woke up. (109 words)

I had a dream that I was in the main building holding a key. I knew it was a key to get into one of the dorms, only on, the one I lived in. I walked out to Langton because it was closest and tried my luck there. The key opened the door and I was thrilled, until I saw about 100 boys draped all over the furniture. They told me that I didn't live there I was so scared I went back to the main building. I tried to figure out my schedule, which I didn't have, as usual. I can't really recall all the details, but I remember waking up and thinking that it was an "outrageous dream about school." (122 words)

My first dream was that I was playing an ice hockey game and all my senior friends had come back to watch, like Aidan, Nick, Anthony, and others. I also remember other faces like Aaron. My stick kept switching from a lefty to a righty, and it was horribly frustrating. We won the game and after I got undressed and changed, I went to the stands to say hi to everyone. I started crying because I had missed them all so much. Then, all of a sudden, everyone disappeared except for Aidan. We sort of started walking towards each other, and then he started crying! And then he disappeared too! I was so sad. That night I went home and had to give this show about a horse. It was 1am and I was showing this horse. Then I saw Aidan crying. I ran to him in the room at soccer camp where we watch movies. He kept saying, "You don't understand," and then I woke up. (167 words)

I had a dream that I was babysitting my brother and we were watching movies. We were watching the Star Wars trilogy. When it was over, he wanted to watch Pocahontas. We were in something I remember as a "public living room." Other people walked in and this one girl had a huge crush on my brother. When I was done babysitting him, I had to go babysit the Pike children in Post. When I was there, it started to snow. Mr. Pike got home as I was unloading the dishwasher. He paid me and let me go. Then school started. I had to go to a Spanish class that was somewhere else. I was packing my backpack to go, and all these people kept taking my stuff and pestering me, so it was impossible to pack. I must have woken up and then begun a new dream. I was one of the friends of the Culkin family. Also in this group was Aidan. We all got really drunk and started walking on this bridge, complaining how adults never understand kids. We were all planning for a surprise party or something...Aidan was meant to guard the door while we all set up. But then I woke up. (207 words)

I dreamed that I was attending soccer camp again. Hannah and Sue were there. We were all having so much fun and looking forward to the next weekend when we'd go to Hannah's house. It was then Friday and we were done with camp. We were all walking towards Hannah's car, when all the younger campers practically killed us by kicking their soccer balls at us. We loaded our bags into the car and went to Hannah's house. I remember us all showering when we got there. Then I wandered around the house into a beautiful Renaissance style living room where two people were having sex. It was really weird, so I left and then woke up. (117 words)

I dreamed that my father was having dinner with Matthew, Albert, and Anthony. They were going to a sleepover later. I wanted to shower before they arrived. Halfway through my shower, I thought I heard them, so I got out and went downstairs. For some reason, Camilia had come and wanted to shower too, so I let her shower while I watched TV. When she was done, I remembered that I hadn't conditioned my hair or anything, so I went back in. When I got out of the shower for the 2nd time, all the boys were there. They began rolling out sleeping bags and mattresses, preparing for the sleepover. Then I must have woken up and started a new dream. This dream I can't remember exactly, except that Hannah, Sue, and I were mad at this other girl. (139 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#029 (08/07/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was at soccer camp again. Charles was one of my counselors and he kept teasing me, in a good way, I guess. Every time I tried to take a picture of him, he would duck or run away. I finally took one of him as we were walking indoors to eat lunch and watch the movie. Inside they were serving lunch (pizza and brownies) to us. Everyone kept saying, "It's OK, we have 2 hours before we have to run again. So I ate some. Then it got dark, as the movie was about to start. I started to fall asleep. When I woke up, everyone was unplugging the lamps. It was really weird, because it was already dark. Then I woke up. (127 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#030 (08/08/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that it was the end of the year and all the seniors were about to graduate. Sue and I were preparing for our exams. It was the night before graduating; so all the seniors were playing games while all the underclassmen were studying. I remember looking into a room and seeing Nick and another girl, which made me jealous. I forget what Nick said, but I left, furious. Sue and I didn't have the proper materials to study for the chemistry exam. We snuck into the science building to get the stuff. When we got there, there was some sort of leak or something, because the whole building was flooded and smelled awful. Sue and I grabbed buckets to carry everything. We swam through the hallways trying to find a light switch. We couldn't, so we returned to the main building. All the seniors were getting ready to leave, and I was so sad and flustered because I didn't think I would see any of them again. Then I saw Anthony and he hugged me and kissed me goodbye. Then I must have woken up and started another dream about The Da Vinci Code. I remember the albino monk, Silas, was trying to kill someone else, and I was trying to stop him. The man Silas was trying to kill came to me for help. He wanted me to disguise him. So I cut him a pair of jeans. I guess I thought that would disguise him. I kept waking up in the middle of the night though. (260 words)

I dreamed that it was the beginning of school. Even though I was supposed to be rooming with Hannah, I had to spend the first night of study hall with my old roommates, Zoey and Maria. I was really annoyed, but I knew that if I spent just one study hall with them, I never would have to again. I think it was probably nearing the end of study hall, because I was feeling really impatient to leave. Then I must have woken up and started a new dream. In this dream, I was at this summer camp. Sue was there and we were having a lot of fun. On the last day, we had to board buses to get us home. One kid was frantically telling us that when we got on the bus, they were going to give us an oxygen mask because of the altitude. Only it was a gas mask and if we put it on, we would die. Sue and I got on and held our masks to our faces, pretending we had them on. We saw a lot of kids put them on and then "fall asleep." We closed our eyes to pretend. The bus stopped and everyone who was alive got out, while they cleaned all the dead bodies off. Sue and I stood outside the bus, crying. When we got back on, they were going to gas the whole bus. I just remember thinking, "This is it, no one will know I'm dead for a long time. I can never see my family or friends again." But just as we were about to board the bus again, a volcano erupted, causing everyone to scatter. I ran all the way home and then woke up. (292 words)

First I dreamed that my friends and I were all trying to help Matthew get into Yale. We were helping him with classes and applications. I think he ended up getting in, but then I started a new dream that was really weird. I had three bedrooms, and whenever I had to talk to someone, they always met me in the wrong room. My next dream was about taking exams. I dreamed that right before each exam in the morning, we all gathered in the dining hall and individually ordered French toast and bacon. The woman got angry because she didn't want to cook. I was slightly confused. My last dream was about this game. There were 20 people and 1 killer. Everyone is trying to find out who this one killer was before they died. They were all forming pacts and groups, just to be betrayed. It was really odd. Then I woke up. (155 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#033 (08/12/2003 (age 14))

My first dream was that I was at a meeting for soccer preseason. All the seniors were talking about how much fun it was, and all the freshmen were looking really scared, but I wasn't. Then I started a new dream. I was in Bundy and Lou was in Owen. I really wanted to see him, but I needed an excuse to run over there. I saw someone delivering a pizza, so I decided I would sneak in when the pizza delivery guy went in. I scooted inside and went to my friend's room (can't remember who...) then I went looking for Lou. But it was Anthony I found. He kissed me and then I woke up. (117 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#034 (08/13/2003 (age 14))

Last night I dreamed that I was at the Dunn's house and Sue, Hannah, Kim and I were all taking the SATs. We were all discussing our answers, which was apparently OK. When we were done, we left to go home. I lived somewhere else. We saw tollbooths and drove through them, but immediately after we entered, all the cars changed directions and they were heading towards us! Horrified, I turned the car around. Then for some reason, we were looking for Anthony to surprise him. He was living in Texas, and when we got down there, people were throwing sand at his house; however, this was considered a gesture or admiration or something like that. Then I started a new dream where Ed was having lunch. Weird. Then I woke up. (132 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#035 (08/14/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that my family and I went to McDonalds every meal. All my friends did too. It was like school, or something, everyone went there everyday with his or her families. The McDonalds was owned by a really sweet man, so when he one day raised the prices, I didn't mind. Soon everything was really expensive, and we stopped going there. My next dream was that someone was trying to kill me. I wasn't being chased or anything like that, but someone was trying to kill me. When I was asleep (in my dream), Lou came into my room. He started crying, and when I woke up he told me that he was the one who was trying to kill me. Then I was at the Lincoln Memorial and it was burning down. Then I woke up in real life. (141 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#036 (08/15/2003 (age 14))

I first dreamed that Sue, Lou, Tristan, and I were all in math class with Mr. Stipps again. We were all trying to find out this one problem, but it was nearly impossible. It was so frustrating. I guess Isabel and I finally gave up, or we figured it out or something, because we eventually left. We went to check our mail. I tried to open my mailbox, but it wouldn't open. I kept trying to open it, but it would just not open. Then Sue and I saw Mel Gibson coming to check his mail (at my high school for some reason...) and he laughed at us because we couldn't open mine. I then started a new dream where my family and I were driving somewhere. We were just driving along the hallway when, all of a sudden, I noticed no one was in the driver's seat. I felt really worried and tried to steer from the back seat. It was really difficult, and I ended up skidding off the road. My last dream was the best! It started badly though. I came home to find all the kids from the local high school having a party. Kylie was throwing the party, and I was really angry. Apparently my house was attached to one of the dorms by a long hallway. So everyone kept running back forth stealing stuff from the dorm rooms. Kylie found this tiny object that was like a kaleidoscope in the shape of a rock. It was brightly colored and she let me look at it. I looked through it and was surprised to see pictures of Anthony, waving, smiling, playing, laughing, reading, etc. I realized that this was the graduation present his parents had given him that he had been waiting to open. I was furious with Kylie for stealing it. I called Anthony and we started chatting and laughing. I kept walking through the hallway to Post, where Anthony lived, but Kylie kept running after me. She wanted the kaleidoscope because she thought Anthony was cute and wanted an excuse to talk to him. I got really mad and tried talking to Anthony through post-it notes. It was really weird. I kept talking to him and then he invited me to his room. He was teasing me crawled on top of me when I sat on his bed. He saw that I had his kaleidoscope and was so happy that he kissed me! Then I woke up. (414 words)

I dreamed that Charla and I were walking through the athletic center and we passed the boys' locker room. The doors were wide open and we could see all the boys inside. We went inside and started talking to them. For some reason, going into the boys' locker room was against the law, and Charla and I knew this, but we kept talking to all the boys (in their towels, by the way). Suddenly, Mrs. Carter pulled us away and began lecturing us about how wrong it was to go into the boys' locker room. I soon fell asleep and had a dream within a dream. This dream was about shopping. I was in Costco shopping for food to keep into my dorm room at school, but then I got lost. I woke up and Mrs. Carter was still lecturing me. Then I really woke up in real life. (149 words)

I dreamed that I was taking Ancient Civilizations again with Mr. Bailey. I was re-writing an essay and I kept trying to email it to him, but it just wouldn't work. I kept getting the email returned to me. Frustrated, I went back to Bundy to see Hannah. It was snowing and all the heaters had broken up, so Katie and I huddled under our comforters, reading. We talked for a while before going to the main building to get dinner. On the way, I saw Matthew. I really wanted to talk to him, but was too shy. Hannah told me to just go up to him and say "hi," so I did and he picked me up and twirled me around. He laughed, put me down, and started walking away. Hannah yelled across the hallway, "See, Bea! It's so easy to talk to guys! I told you!" I was embarrassed, but luckily Matthew didn't her. Julian, however, did. He began to laugh, but he didn't care. We went to the dining hall and saw Caroline and Sue. They were getting rice and singing the Goo Goo Dolls. Then I woke up. (192 words)

I dreamed first that Sue and Hannah and I were all in Poland. We were walking around my high school (in Poland) and saw Angelina at the auditorium. We all went in to watch a movie. Then, I dreamed that my father was up against 6 saber-toothed tigers, and that he defeated them all. Reporters from ESPN wanted to interview him. He kept saying things like, "I'm da man," "Who's your daddy?," and "I'm in da house!" My last dream was that Hannibal Lecter kidnapped me and he wanted to kill me. Then I woke up. (96 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#041 (08/23/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was running away from someone...but I can't remember exactly who it was. Then I was at soccer camp again and it was my birthday. I got to pick out a stuffed animal from a bag. Jon was there and had given me a Tiffany heart charm bracelet with my name engraved on it. Aidan had bought me dinner. The best part, though, was Anthony pushing through the crowd and taking me on a date to a swimming pool. We swam around all night and it was really warm. HE would lift me and carry me on his shoulders around in the water, all the while rubbing his hands across my skin. Then I started a new dream that my brother and I were in the library and we were standing in front of the Mona Lisa. Then I woke up. (144 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#042 (08/25/2003 (age 14))

I first dreamed that I was in Florence, because that is where my parents were getting married (weird). Either I was really sick or sad, because someone gave me a huge cake. I remember falling asleep in my dream and being awoken to crashing noises and explosions. I looked out my window, and people were running and screaming everywhere. It was weird though; they were all celebrating for something, rather than screaming about something bad. I was frustrated because I couldn't find anyone I knew and I had no idea what everyone was screaming about. Then I must have begun a new dream because all of a sudden I was at the spring carnival. Everyone was having a lot of fun as usual --Jello-wrestling, slip-and-sliding, and everything else --I can't remember a lot of details, but then everyone went to the dining hall. I was eating strawberries with sugar. Across the dining hall, Leah was strutting around on a table. She got embarrassed and tried to make it a joke, but no one laughed. Then I woke up. (178 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#043 (08/28/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was at the beach and was swimming against Rachel. I had to swim from one dock to another, so I dove in and touched the bottom. Immediately, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I struggled to the surface, feeling the pressure on my lungs. It was really scary and I kept pushing upward. Finally I reached the surface and gulped air in. I was breathing really hard in real life and woke myself up for a second. Then when I fell back asleep I was walking home from the beach in my comforter. I was so tired I could barely stand up. It started raining and this little boy appeared carrying an umbrella and he kept me dry. When I got to my house, I asked him his name. It was Colin. So I got home and Kylie called asking me to help her on her math placement exam. I really didn't want to, but she kept begging me, so I couldn't just hang up. So then Sue drove up and asked me if I wanted to go with her to the mall and then to the movies. I really wanted to go with her, but Kulie wouldn't stop bugging me, so Sue drove off. I was really mad. Then the power went out and I couldn't turn my computer on. (225 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#044 (08/30/2003 (age 14))

Last night I had a very odd dream that there was this huge concert on the quad. There was a stage, a crowd, and everything. It was right in the beginning of the year, so everyone was really excited and energetic. I was sitting next to Gianna and we got called up on stage. When we got there, it started to shake uncontrollably, like some kind of trampoline. Everyone was laughing and cheering as we struggled to stay upright. We finally got off and walked inside Langton so I could go to the bathroom. I saw Lou and Ariana washing dishes. They had just seen my "performance" and were being really critical of it. Ariana said that when she saw me, she wanted to vomit. Lou laughed and then --to my horror --agreed. He was going out with Vanessa, and Ariana was discussing that now with Lou. I ran to the other end of the dorm and began to cry. I hated him for agreeing with Ariana, and I hated myself for liking him. On the opposite end of the hall was a movie theater. I went inside to watch Finding Nemo. There was a guy with flowers waiting for me; he was oddly reminiscent of Anthony. We began to chat and laugh, and soon Lou was out of my mind. When the movie was over, we walked out of Langton to find the campus deserted. We entered another dorm to find lots of people crammed inside. All the students were doing ridiculous chores and exercises as punishment from the teachers for having the huge concert. We ran out and into another dorm to avoid being caught and made to mow the grass with our teeth, or duel each other with umbrellas. We ran upstairs to my room. We could hear a teacher frantically pursuing us. I had the topmost loft as my room, only accessible by a leader, which unfortunately had been shattered. We tried in vain to climb up, but it was useless. We were caught and led downstairs where we were forced to drive metal pegs into the ground. Then I woke up. (356 words)

I dreamed that I belonged to this very prestigious book club. Pauline was there and so was Brenda. We were all discussing a book we had just read. All of a sudden, the floor turned to ice. We were in a huge mansion, and all the oriental rugs were turned to ice. Then the ice started to crack and all the chairs fell through to the freezing water below. I was so scared, but then I woke up. (78 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#046 (09/02/2003 (age 14))

I dreamed that I was on some trip somewhere and I was driving a huge coach bus with all my friends in it. Since I was driving, I was the one who decided where we stop for bathroom breaks and stuff. No one could agree with me about when and where to stop though, so I became frustrated and finally stopped at a rest area. I saw a little boy who looked lost. He spoke Spanish, so I said, "Donde es el coche?" (Where is your car?) But then I remembered that I had to use estar instead of ser. So I corrected myself and said "Donde esta; el coche?" A man nearby told me that the only way the little boy would find his way home is if I brought him to the church at the end of the mall at the rest area. I asked, "Donde esta la iglesia?" A woman told me she would lead me there. So I picked the little boy up and walked behind the woman. On the way I saw Ava; she had been shopping. She showed me a black tank top she had bought from Express. She asked if I wanted to borrow any of her money to shop, but I said no. Then I woke up. (215 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#047 (09/03/2003 (age 14))

I had this horrible dream that we were playing a hockey game. Our third line (my line) was completely out of it, and we just couldn't play. One girl was missing from the first line, so Chloe moved me up to play with them --big mistake! They were much faster and more skilled than I. I would try to pass the puck, and they'd be gone from the space I'd passed to. I couldn't position myself correctly because they would always skate away. Finally the game ended; we had won, and Chloe and Mrs. Carter were thrilled. Everyone then left and I was alone on the bench. Then all the lights went out. I began to take off my equipment right then and there. Doing so, I managed to lose my gloves, pants, and skates. When I finally had put what was remaining of my equipment into my bag, I assumed that my skates had somehow magically been transported to the locker room. I must have started a new dream, because next thing I know I am talking to Anthony. And it's weird because I know somewhere in the back of my mind that he's dead. But I kept talking to him. I was so sad because he was dead. But then I woke up. (215 words)

When I got there, there was an itinerary that told me when I would be getting my teeth pulled out. I wasn't aware of this and was thoroughly frightened. Then we had some tribute dedicated to Keira Knightley because she had died. When cars passed by, they would honk out of respect. Then I woke up. (86 words)

I had a really gory dream last night. Sue and I worked for the CIA and we both had some special 6th sense. The CIA would tell us general areas where someone had been murdered, and we would have to go scout around for either the murderer or the dead body. It was really scary because the killer could be anywhere, and Sue and I were the only ones who could see the body. We had special equipment and everything. It was traumatizing to see the bodies. I remember seeing the lower half of a body with knives stuck in the legs. It was horrible. Thank God I woke up! (110 words)

Mrs. Frank was there and wanted me to babysit, but I really didn't want to. So I hurried to make my tea. Then I went to the back of the dining hall, and there was this Harry Potter game open and there was a scary monster in it. I wanted it to leave, but it wouldn't. It was terrible! Then I woke up.

Last night I dreamed that everyone was in the auditorium and we all had to get up if we had ever done drama before. I was the only one not to get up. Then we all had to tell our most embarrassing moments. It was finally my turn and I began to say that I often tripped a lot in the always, when I realized no one was listening. My mother stood up and told everyone to be quiet and listen to my most embarrassing moment --how ironic, as that would easily be my most embarrassing moment. I was horrified and stormed out of the auditorium. I want to check my mailbox and the new Facebook was there. I went upstairs and there was a database there that recorded all the hookups in the entire school. Then I woke up. (140 words)

I dreamed that I was in the main building and I was making out with someone. I felt kind of awkward about doing that in public, so I left to go to lunch. For some reason, it was graduation tomorrow. I was astounded. Where did the whole year go? I felt like it had just been fall, and now all of a sudden it was graduation? I saw the seniors packing their bags and loading them into their cars. I began to cry so hard because I had not spent enough time with everyone. After graduation, I was playing hockey, when I should have been studying for exams. I went back to the library and Hannah and Sue were there. Albert came back from Spain and told us he had moved to the ocean. Then I had to think about college!?! Thank god I woke up! (146 words)

I had so many dreams last night! The first dream was that during study hall, I was abused. From 7:30-8:00 I could work and study, but then at 8, I had to strip down to my underwear and go into a cell where it was wet and freezing cold. I was abused and hurt or an hour and a half and I was furious because I didn't even know why. I hated it! Then I had a dream that my family and I were all going on a trip to Sea World. My brother and I sat in the splash section, and then left hurriedly. On the way home, we were playing in the sand, trying to set up some sort of box. We got sand in our eyes and rushed to wash it out with the ocean water. Our eyes really burned then from the salt and the sand. Then Hannah and I were walking back from lunch or something to Bundy. The seniors were all trying to yank each other's pants off to embarrass one another. When Hannah and I got to the dorm, we had emails from all of them saying something bad was going to happen. Anyway, then I had a dream about Counting Crows, that I was going to see them. Then I woke up. (220 words)

I dreamed that I was in the main building and I was wearing my angel costume. Lou started chasing me because he wanted to take my wings. He finally caught up with me and took them. Then I began to chase him through the hallways. He ran upstairs to the little quad of chairs outside of the history wing. I cornered him and he collapsed onto one of the couches. I began to tickle him to get my wings back. He was very ticklish and was squirming uncontrollably. Eventually, he dropped my wings. When I bent over to pick them up, he grabbed me and pushed me onto the chair. He then began to tickle me. I was breathing so hard. I begged him to stop, and he finally did. Then he leaned down to kiss me. All of a sudden it was a new dream. The science building was attached to the main building through a long, tall staircase right near the yearbook room. I remember having to go to the yearbook room to layout some more pages. Then I woke up. (183 words)

I dreamed that they were redoing the post office part of the main building to look more like the Sistine Chapel. Mr. Links was trying out different practice schedules. I studied for exams. Anna and I were trying to figure out when we had practice. I kept falling over and falling asleep throughout the main building and around the athletic center because I was so tired. I told Charla she needed to get Jay to ask him something about our class. So he came over and tried to wake me up. I felt so weak. I only woke up when Lou came to get me. We then walked to the Sistine Chapel to find out when we had practice, but there were so many staircases that I couldn't find where to go. Then I was in front of the dorms. Then I woke up.

I dreamed that I was playing soccer down on the fields. There was going to be a pep rally later, so I hurried to the athletic center to shower and change. In the locker room I bumped into Lou. He was wearing red boxers and he had a white towel in front of him. He was laughing, so then I began laughing and woke up. (65 words)

I had a dream that we were doing the proctor switch. Hannah and I lived on Bundy 3 and our proctors were taking us down to the lake to take a walk. There was a huge octopus that lived on Bundy 1. His tentacles were blocking all the doors. On the way up from the walk, the proctors were throwing worms. It was horrible. When we got up to school, Sue was baking Krispy Kremes. Then I woke up.

I dreamed that I was Ariel from The Little Mermaid. I was swimming all over the place in the lake. People were on a ship telling secrets and I wanted to know what they were saying so badly. But I couldn't climb up onto the ships. But I couldn't climb up. Anyway, then I was in the dining hall, sitting at the senior boys' table. Ed was there. We went outside and walked around and talked about love. When we got inside, all the senior boys were doing some sort of race on the ramp. I went to go watch and Lou was up. After he went, he grabbed my hand and yanked me away from the crowd. My mother had booked a makeover for me, but I didn't really want one. Then I woke up. (136 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#075 (11/18/2003 (age 15))

So first I dreamed that I was at my high school and it was the last day of this year. All these guys were asking me out. Then I was at college in California. It was the kind of college where if you went to my high school, you immediately went to this college. Then there were other kids from other schools there as well. It was really dangerous. We had to cross 6 roads all next to each other to get to the school. The last 2 were these horribly steep and narrow staircases where people would skateboard. I was walking down them and the skateboarders couldn't see us. So I was especially scared. I finally got to my dorm and all my friends were going skating. They all left and I changed and put sunscreen on. Andrea and Camilia were there and they wanted to know if my boyfriends at my high school had made me any more comfortable with dating in college. I guess I kind of blew them off, because next thing I know, I am at the beach. It started to rain, so I had to go back to school. I was so sad when I looked at all these pictures of my high school friends and realized how much I missed them. I was in English with a lot of the freshmen, and Ms. Williams came in and announced we were having the school play that day. Everyone was really excited, except me, because it was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays were my best days, so I would have to miss my favorite classes. We had 30 minutes before we had to be in the auditorium. I went looking for my friends. Sue was giving a tour. Gianna and her brother were up in the math wing. I started walking to the dining hall. Gabby was in the senior quad and she started making fun of me because I always looked shy. Beside her was a shelf of books. They were all fictional love stories. Then I woke up. (344 words)

Bea 1: a high school student:#077 (11/10/2003 (age 15))

I dreamed that I was at school. Hannah and I were all in the library studying for exams. Neo, from The Matrix, was there getting us to try different kinds of jellybeans. All of a sudden, we were back in the dorm. Sue was showering and Hannah and I were in our room eating Cape Cod chips. When Sue came in, the fire alarm went off. We all had to get out of the building. The sprinklers went off. So then I had a new dream that I was at Audrey's house and Pauline was getting married. Audrey wanted me to ride Pauline's horse into the woods to find the rest of our relatives. When I got on the horse, he started talking to me. Then I woke up. (129 words)

I had a really vivid dream that I was in a mansion watching a movie. Then I was at Sue's house and they were trying to replace their cat. It was much more detailed; I just can't remember it all now. (41 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#079 (12/16/2003 (age 15))

I had a horrible dream last night! First, Lord Voldemort was after me and I couldn't hide from him. I tried to run outside my house in the woods. He heard me and went back inside to get a flashlight for some reason. Then I ran up by the Links' house and Mr. Links came back with his flashlight. He found me, so I made a deal with him that if he stopped killing everyone else, he could kill me. It was so scary. Then I had a dream that we bought a new dog crate, not even a new dog, but just a new crate. It was a huge deal for some reason. I couldn't understand why everyone was so worked up, but whatever. So that ended and then I dreamed that it was exam time again at school. The new policy was that you could either take the exam in the classes you were taking, or you could pick up a new class and take that exam. So I decided to pick up dance and take that exam --it was a lot of fun! But ever since I had picked it up and had to dance with Julian, Lou stopped talking to me. It was unbearable and I couldn't understand why he was ignoring me. So for the exam, I had to have sex with Julian. I was really reluctant to do this, but I was guaranteed an A in the class and that I wouldn't even remember having sex with him, so I did. But the next morning, I was really sore and I did remember everything. Lou came up behind me and started flirting with me again, and I was so happy he wasn't ignoring me. I ran up to him and tried to hug him. Then he pushed me away, and I was really confused. I asked him what his problem was, and he said something to the effect of, "At least I didn't sleep with someone to get a good grade. I don't want you sleeping with other boys." I guess it was cute that he cared, but it was horrible having him mad at me! (362 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#080 (12/23/2003 (age 15))

My first dream was that it was exam time and I had taken every exam except for Spanish. For Spanish, I had to clone people. Jackson was right in front of me doing the same thing. The clones came from every room, and it was impossible to keep track of them. Finally, Sra. Perez said we had made enough and that we could leave. I had had a lot of feelings towards Jackson lately. He brought me into Tinker into an empty room. We weren't doing anything except kissing, but the whole time in there felt really sexual. He had his shirt off or something, but it felt like we were doing more than just kissing, even though we weren't Anyway, we were there for awhile before the person who lived there came back and kicked us out. We were holding hands as we left. We went to the library to start studying for another exam, which was weird since we were done with our exams. Then we had Fun Friday. It was the weirdest one ever, but it was everyone's favorite. There was a monster onstage plus 3 students. The monster could see one person, but not the other two. We all had to kill the monster, but the more people that came on stage, the more the monster could see us. He could also hear us. I remember looking at my watch and realizing an hour had gone by. Then I woke up. (245 words)

I dreamed that I had bought the brand new Synergy hockey stick, and I couldn't wait to use it. There was a pick up hockey game some winter night when we were getting snowed in. When I picked up, however, I realized that I had bought a righty instead of a lefty. I was so disappointed at myself for my foolish mistake. No matter how hard I tried, the stick stayed righty. All the other girls laughed at me. Then I started a new dream that was at my brother's 2nd grade parent-teacher conferences. I was really bored and kept falling asleep until the teacher used me as an example of the student who had perfectly gotten through elementary and middle school, and that I was doing excellent now as well. Then another woman engaged me in a conversation about Pirates of the Caribbean but I fell asleep (in my dream). Then I woke up in real life. (158 words)

I dreamed that I was PERFECT in every way: looks, sports, brains, personality, talent, etc. I was perfect. So I was running around with this really tall, dark, handsome guy. We were by the ocean and he said he'd love me forever. Then I realized I was just a character for a John Updike story, so I was really scared and wanted to see the ending, but I was woken up instead for Christmas. (74 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#083 (12/27/2003 (age 15))

First I dreamed that I was babysitting Layla. I was trying to do everything perfectly since her dad was my soccer coach. We went to the ocean and came back to her house to bake cookies. We were just rolling out the dough when her mom came back and paid me. Next, I was in some really fancy modern Japanese-style house. Every time I finished a homework assignment, I was allowed to get up and get a piece of candy. The thing was --the assignments never seemed to end. No sooner would I finish one then I would have another one. Finally it was study hall and I was working with Ava, Isaiah, and Beth. It was weird because I think Isaiah liked me. Then I woke up. (128 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#084 (12/28/2003 (age 15))

I dreamed that there was some sort of Olympics at school. There were 3 big events. Halfway through one I ran to Taylor for some reason just to hang out, I guess. Next day I was watching the real Olympics. I realized I had hockey practice, so I ran to Bundy to get ready. I was really panicked because I couldn't find my watch or something. When I got there, someone had died. We had this huge underclassmen funeral. Then I was in a department store of some sort. Someone else was with me and there were these two sort of scary-looking men, who wanted to buy us jewelry. We found two pairs of earrings we liked, and they went to buy them for us. The woman at the counter said they were Tiffany earrings, but somehow I couldn't believe her. There were 3 little dogs there too and they were yapping all over the place. So then I was at Hogwarts. Professor Snape was looking all over the place for me. I accidentally set off a charm that made all these bombs explode. The whole school rushed into the hallways. We had to bring as much money outside as possible. It was freezing outside. But then I woke up. (210 words)

I dreamed that Jackson and I were on a bus on the way home from my elementary school. He jumped out of the bus to run to my house. It was pouring rain, so we had to change into dry clothes. I was changing when he walked in and saw me. I wasn't embarrassed, for some reason. But there was something I was trying to hide in my closet, so I was worried that he would find it. Then I woke up.

I dreamed that I was back in 8th grade and had to make a poster about the solar system. So I made it and brought it into school. The presentations were held in the lunchroom. The presentations started and I realized how inadequate my work was. So I shifted my posters around until I found the best one I had made about the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. I used that and presented, and did very well. Then I had some dream about Jackson, that I was talking to him through a wall. I also dreamed I woke up next to him. Then I woke up. (106 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#088 (01/01/2004 (age 15))

I dreamed that my brother and I were electricians of some sort and had to install TVs into houses/trailers in a trailer park. It was scary because the trailer park was next to a chemical plant, so it was always releasing chemicals and other horrible things into the air. And it was really loud. The trailer we were working on was constructed like an airplane. My brother and I tried to figure out how to fly it, but couldn't. So then I dreamed it was exam period. I had an 8am math exam, but for some reason instead of going to the classroom, I went to the movie theater to see Love Actually. This didn't seem at all weird though. Caroline went in and told me she'd save me a seat while I went to get ice cream. I wanted Butterscotch ice cream, and there was only one vendor that had it. My mother was in the line ahead of me. As soon as it was my turn, the woman closed everything up. I was really annoyed and went upstairs. All these junior and senior boys I didn't know were there. I really wanted this butterscotch ice cream, but no one had it. Instead I just had some diet coke. Everyone was leaving the movie theater, so I guess I missed the movie. I found my friends and realized that my dress had fallen off. I left hurriedly, thinking it was just a trick of my mind, hoping it was just a trick of my mind. I saw Lou walking out of the dining all. He was carrying something and his hair was really short. I noticed he was wearing these terrible looking shoes, and I decided that I should stop liking him for that reason. I went back to my friends and all of a sudden I was looking into a deep abyss, like where Mordor is in Lord of the Rings. I ran away as fast as I could and ran into my math teacher, who noticed I had missed the exam! Thank god I woke up! (349 words)

I dreamed that Sue and I were in a car together. Isabel called our Spain program to see if she got in. They said she had. So then I called to ask if I got in, and they said I hadn't, but that there was a program in Russia if I was interested. For some reason if I wanted to go to Russia, I had to learn Latin, which wouldn't have been so bad. I remember telling myself that this was a dream and waking myself up. (87 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#090 (01/03/2004 (age 15))

I dreamed that I owned this "salty bar" with Granddaddy right next to the ocean. One day, the whole school had to sail over to China to hear some sort of lecture. I missed the boat and had to swim over. I had brought a plate of Brie, but it was filled with poisonous crabs from my trip over. I dropped the dish when I got on land, and was terrified that they would poison me. But then I told myself that this was a dream, so I kept on walking to the lecture. When I got there, it was more like SNL than a serious lecture. I couldn't understand why we'd had to travel that whole way for this. I was sitting on the stage and could see Jackson right in front of me. The lecture ended 3 hours early. The deans said we had to remain there for the next 3 hours before going back. Vanessa started whining but then everyone made fun of her, so that was OK. Then Jackson looked at me and said he loved me and I woke up. (185 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#091 (01/04/2004 (age 15))

I first dreamed that my dean and I were best friends and I always went to his house to hang out. It was weird. Then I dreamed that Charla and I were in New Hampshire at Granddaddy's, and she wanted to take a boat on the lake at night. I knew it was a bad idea, but I went out with her anyway. We were 20 feet out into the water when I decided to turn back, because I knew this was wrong. My father had been sitting on the dock the whole time, and was proud that I had turned back. Then I dreamed that Sue and I were doing track. We finished with our warm up and this guy came up to talk to me. He was cute, sort of looked like Dylan and Nicholas put together. We were talking and flirting, and then all of a sudden, we were back at my house. He was flirting with me while we watched a movie. His name was Kevin Laradin, which is a name I've never heard or read before. Then I woke up. (185 words)

I had the worst dream ever. I dreamed that I was at some sort of camp, but it was military/boot camp. We were running laps around the track until I thought I was going to be sick. Then I got news that both my mother and father had died. I freaked out. But the guy kept making me run more laps. So then I threw up and I told myself that this had to be a dream. But I couldn't wake myself up. So then we had to sail down this river. But my boat got lost and I had to swim against the current. Thank god I woke up. (110 words)

I dreamed that we had a holiday, so everyone was in the main building. It was really boring, however, and no one was doing anything. Everyone, including the boys, was wearing pants and a bra. It was weird. So then Kim and Sue went to Sue's house. I remember seeing Kevin and Nicholas and Hannah in Bundy. A girl on the first floor was trying to go to sleep and told me to go to bed too. But I couldn't think about sleep. But then when I concentrated really hard, it sort of worked. Then I was talking online and Sue and Kim were soaked because it was raining. I was asking Aidan if I could sleep in his room, since I couldn't here. He laughed and said yes. Then I woke up. (133 words)

I dreamed first that I was in this huge mansion and I had to help deliver all these babies. All the women having the babies had to go up all these stairs though. Then I had to help them down the stairs to the delivery room. So then I was a slave in some huge landowner's house and I was running away with a baby in my little green Oshkosh overalls from when I was a baby. So we stole this food and other things we would need and put them in Bloomingdales bags. As soon as we left the house, the woman came after as, so we hid under a bench. I prayed she wouldn't see us or hear us breathing. The next dream I had --I was in the library trying to steal something heavily guarded by giant squids. It was impossible and I was really frustrated. The library was like a planetarium, so I lay down and looked up at all the stars in the ceiling. Then I had to go to Spanish class. Then I woke up.

Bea 1: a high school student:#105 (02/07/2004 (age 15))

I first dreamed that I was in the chapel, which was huge. Lou was next to me and I remember hearing the organ music from above. All of a sudden, I was in my bedroom. My friends and I were flying mattresses outside my window. There was tundra and icy cold water beneath us, so we didn't want to fall in. First it was just Sue and I, so it was easy to balance. Then more of our friends wanted to join us, but we weren't sure if the mattress could hold all of us. So Sue took a rope and attached it to the mattress and swam through the air. We were all fine. Then I realized that we didn't have our wings, and we all started falling. We landed hard in some military school. We ran away. So then I was at school in the snack bar. I ordered a blueberry muffin and ate it outside. I saw Caleb reading something and he called me over to lie down with him. I lay down and he put his book down. He wrapped his arm around me and held my hand with his free hand underneath his chin. He blinked and I could feel his eyelashes on my forehead. Our lips were touching, but we weren't kissing. I was worried about my breath. He started breathing a little harder and pulled me closer. Then I saw my mother and father, but they didn't see me. And then I woke up. (251 words)

I dreamed that we were having Martin Luther King Jr. Day in a huge stadium, like Madison Square Garden. One of our all school sessions had just finished, so we were all leaving. I saw Jackson and we did our little smiling thing. I made the sign that I would call him. So then I was doing laundry in the mailroom and I ran out of quarters. I finally found some and put them in the slot. I remember being very confused as to how to do my laundry. Then we had to go back to the auditorium and all watch a movie. It was the freshmen class doing a skit about how much they hated Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Weird...then there was this woman who looked like Mary Poppins. She had a butterfly costume on and was asking this man in the audience to marry her. He said he would do anything but marry her. Then she flew off with the rest of the butterflies. Then someone shot her down. A boy ran to her fallen body and opened up her wings. They were beautiful. I took them and left the auditorium away from everyone else. A little girl ran up behind me and tried to take the wings. They ripped a little bit, but I gave them to her. I was yelled at for this. I went to shower and realized that one of my shoes was gone. I went to the locker room and looked for it. But it wasn't there. So I never found it, but I remember seeing the boys going to soccer practice. (270 words)

Then my mother, brother, and I all had to go on some trip. A spider crawled out of my brother's backpack and he threw a huge fit. We all walked into a grocery store to buy snacks. I wanted to get juice boxes in the store and my mother got really upset. She bought my brother chips. Then she remembered that she had left something important at home. So we had to leave. Then I was in the auditorium and it was snowing and everyone was dancing. Then I woke up. (122 words)

I dreamed that James Bond lived in my basement and was having a huge party. There were 6 bars, strippers, gamblers, kegs, and lots of music and everything. I went down there and people were playing card games. But the people weren't real. I guess I just asked why the people weren't real. Someone told me that James Bond was impersonal. So the fake people represented the superficiality of them. I went back upstairs. Then I was trying to watch a movie, but my brother and Wyatt were shooting hockey pucks all over the place and I couldn't do whatever it was I wanted to do. I was really frustrated. Granddaddy was making cereal for a present for me. (119 words)

I dreamed that there were all these houses in the main building, and that it was huge, kind of like Versailles, times 100! I had on a pair of wings and was flying around the library. And there were all these incredible Alexander Calder mobiles around. The place was huge, no matter where you turned there were more rooms or stairs. There were several libraries, small rooms, kitchens, ballrooms, pools, everything. Lou kept trying to take my wings. Then I had to buy shoes or something. Then I woke up. (90 words)

I dreamed first that I was riding back from a hockey game with Caleb. We were cuddling and just sitting next to each other. Then when we got back to school, Caleb was going to go with the Varsity Girls team to their game. I was kind of upset and volunteered to drive the bus to the game so that I could be with him. Then I realized that I didn't know how to drive. The bus keeled over and Matthew came to save us. At the hockey rink, Lou was tickling me and flirting with me, and he hurt his back. I traveled to the hospital in the ambulance with him, and kissed his chest over and over again, hoping that would help in some way. Then I was just so mad about Caleb that I kept throwing things around and stomping on them. I was in a rage because he had ditched me earlier. Then I woke up. (160 words)

I dreamed that I was in this huge dark house with a random scary guy. I had my laptop with me and was trying to shut it down. I remember wanting to go home really badly but I couldn't until my laptop shut down. The big scary random guy kept coming on to me and trying to get me to take my clothes off. He was trying to rape me, and I was really scared. So I tried to call my father, but all the numbers on the phone had been rearranged, so I couldn't figure it out. The guy was chasing after me, telling me that he was just fooling around. I started to cry, and finally I was able to call home. But I didn't know where I was! My father kept asking me where he should pick me up, and all I could say was that I was somewhere in the mountains. It was awful. The guy caught me and hung the phone up. But then Caleb came in and hit the guy and saved me. He brought me to his car and we drove for a long time. We finally got to a motel type place attached to school. Hugh started making fun of me, and I hit him square in the chest. He grabbed my hand and pulled me really close to him. Our foreheads were touching and we were about to kiss, but I was still so upset about that scary guy that I ran away. I ran into Mr. Lopez, who tried assigning me more geometry homework. I tried to do it, but it was really difficult. Everyone around me kept trying to mess me up, so I was running away, holding onto my geometry homework. Then I woke up. (297 words)

I first dreamed that I was in chemistry, when I realized my entire schedule had changed. I was in none of the same classes, but my entire schedule was somehow filled up. I had the opposite lunch period from all my friends, and Billy Joel was my college advisor. Then I was in my room sorting my bras, and I couldn't find the white one I was looking for. Then, I dreamed that I was sailing in the pool. There were 3 different kinds of boats, and I didn't know which one to use, so I asked Caleb. Pete, Sam, and some other guys kept trying to listen, so Caleb waited until they went away so he could tell me which boat to use. I distinctly remember putting my hand up to cover my mouth, even though he was the one who was whispering. Our mouths were really close again, but we pulled away before anything happened, I guess. Next, I was at some swim meet and there were bookshelves lined up for bleachers. They were really narrow, so I kept falling off onto the pool deck. People laughed at me when I fell. Mason and Isaiah were sitting on the bookshelf with me and they finally fell too when the whole thing toppled into the water. Then I lived in this house of grime. I lived right next to some huge factory, so all the dirt, grime, smoke, and ash from the factory made a film over my house. It was really disgusting. Then I woke up. (258 words)

I dreamed that my skin was absolutely covered in these awful boils. They were crusty and pussy and just everywhere. I couldn't wear anything because clothes irritated my skin too much. But I had to get to class by the time my Harry Potter tape finished. So I was rushing around trying to find a tank top to wear. When I got to school, it was like a bar. The lights were dim and there was cigarette smoke everywhere. My father and I looked at a Patagonia catalog, trying to find clothes that wouldn't bother my boils. I woke up scratching myself to try and make them go away, and was SO happy when I didn't actually have boils! (119 words)

I had a dream that there was a formal dance in the library, which was 8 floors. I was walking back with someone, and I guess I had a date to this dance, but I think I still needed a dress and shoes. Then it was the beginning of the year because we were all moving into Bundy again. Hannah had totally changed the room around. Then we were in the dining hall eating really good French toast. Sue was eating raisin bran. We wondered if when we were juniors we would change seats in the dining hall. I wanted more French toast, but they had run out of syrup. I had to pack my laptop up to get more. On the way, I saw Kevin dressed as a huge bug. He said, "Hi, Bea," and I said, "Nice antennae." So then I went back to my seat and all last year's seniors were back. I tried to get the syrup, but they were taking it all. So then Sue and Charla and I were supposed to meet up later, but I woke up. (184 words)

We had to play all these games to help us learn how to drive. Hugh was there and he kept poking me and then saying, "You can never be my girlfriend because you can't drive yet." Weird. So then I dreamed that it was spring carnival again and we were all Jello-wrestling. I wanted to do my laundry so I wouldn't be wearing my sticky clothes. But apparently the laundry service put your dirty clothes in bags and never washed them. Then I woke up. (115 words)

I dreamed that Johnny Depp was in the hospital and I wanted to see him. So I devised a way to pretend that one of my relatives was in the same hospital room so that I could have an excuse to see him. He had changed his appearance, accent, and everything about him, however, so that when I got to the hospital, I couldn't tell who he was. I forget who, but someone I knew ended up in the same room as this dark Transylvanian guy, who ended up being Johnny Depp. I went in the room and was about to start talking to him when the entire hospital was about to collapse. I remember seeing Caleb and Alexis and knowing that I had to save them, but then I woke up. (132 words)

I dreamed that I was in Post, but instead of looking for Caleb, I was looking for Bud. I saw him sleeping in his room and I guess he must have looked really hot, because all of a sudden, I started liking him. Then I was taking a Spanish quiz with some other kids in my class, and we were on a raft in the middle of some bay. An alligator kept dragging us into the water and when one of us would try to save the other, the alligator would grab us. So then I was in the parking lot of CVS in a huge black suburban. I wasn't supposed to be out late at night and was horrified to see my father, because he would probably yell at me for being out past my curfew. I tried to drive away, but realized that I couldn't drive. I ran Freddie Prinze Jr. over on my way home. I was horrified, but apparently he was OK. He said really sarcastically, "Thanks, Bea. Thanks a lot." I was so happy that he knew my name, but sad that I had run him over! (192 words)

I told my father that the next time I got married, I wanted to have a white dress and that I wanted to marry someone that I loved in that way, not because it was the law. Then I woke up. Weird.

I had been asleep that night when some boy came into my room and wrote his name, address, and phone number on my ceiling. Apparently he was initiating some important moment, but I didn't understand. We then talked about terrorist bombings in Rome and Angels and Demons. I also dreamed that there was a TV show about killing wild cats. And I was on it, except I had no weapons! Lastly, I dreamed that Ed was rifling through all my stuff, but I don't know why. (119 words)

I had a dream that the girls' lacrosse team had a really early game one day or something, so they had to wake up at 6am on Sunday. Leanne was complaining that this was unfair because no one else had to wake up, so she demanded that the entire school wake up at 6am as well. I turned to her and snapped, "It's going to be really unfair when you get into Princeton because of your lacrosse skills, when far more deserving people get turned down, especially when they are much smarter than you!" That shut her up! Then I had a dream that I was in a store and had a fixed amount of money. I bought a pink iPod and a bottle of Chanel perfume. Then I decided to buy different perfume. And then I woke up, but had none of my purchases! (145 words)

I dreamed that I had to take the AP US History exam, even though I hadn't taken the class. I also forgot all my pens and pencils and freaked out when I got to the exam. I asked if I could go home and change, but I wasn't allowed to. I left anyway and went down to the lake to take a break before I had to take the exam. On my way back up the hill, I couldn't move. Everyone around me was walking up the hill, and I became really mad because I thought I was going to miss the exam. I guess I was rooming with Victoria, because she was there too. I never made it to the AP, so I had to take it online during the summer. Then I had this power that I could make people fall in love with whomever they wanted. And then I woke up. (154 words)

Pauline was in line inside and I tried asking secretly which one it was, but then I got yelled at! (117 words)

I dreamed that Mr. Winter was brainwashing us by interpreting The Great Gatsby incorrectly. Haley and I were the only ones in the class who knew and we both freaked out and ran away. We were on a train somewhere, a really huge train, like the size of a mall. I somehow knew the train was going to be hijacked, so we got off at Ed's house. There, I made plans for us to get picked up. When I went to get out of bed (that's where I was emailing from, I guess), I discovered that I was naked. I found some way to trick Ed into not looking at me while I ran away. I found a pay phone, but I needed 12 quarters to make a call. I wanted to call my mother to tell her I would be home late, but then I heard her calling my name, and I think she was in real life, which is why I woke up. (165 words)

So we were in the dining hall (my friends and I), and I guess we were studying for exams. But Orlando walked up to our table and pulled me away. I guess he needed me to fix his shirt collar or trim his hair, because all of a sudden we were alone in the corner. I kissed Orlando. After that, he kept chasing me everywhere. Then I had another dream that I was hanging out with Jackson, just walking around and messing around and kissing, but then I looked at my watch and realized it was almost midnight. I had forgotten my curfew. I tried to take a train home and my father told me I should have been home earlier because I had to babysit that night. The kids wanted to rescue this horse, but it was out of Beauty and the Beast, the scene where all the wolves attack the beast, and Belle has to save him. So they finally went inside and had breakfast. Later I played soccer with Sue. (201 words)

I dreamed that I was with My mother, and she was looking for these papers from Mr. Manner. We went to his house, where my brother was making hamburgers. He was doing some dance about this one burnt hamburger. Kylie was there and she wanted me to go see a movie with her, but I told her I was jetlagged and about to fall asleep any minute. She said it was OK because she was working at The Old New Yorker, which was some sort of antique store of New Yorker magazines. Then Alexis and Sra. Perez wanted me to go shopping with them at this huge Victoria's Secret. But I remembered that I had just gone, so I told them no. Finally, Tyler was wearing a green polo shirt, and we were running around trying to hide from these guys who were chasing us. We kept diving into different communal beds at the refuge. We couldn't get away so we went to this Christmas store where they were taking pictures. We thought we would blend in because Tyler was wearing green, and it was Christmas. When we got there, I realized that Santa was missing from all the pictures, so I ran to the bathroom where he was apparently being held hostage. I saved him just in time. Then Tyler told me I was perfect and I kissed him! Then we ran away and I woke up. (238 words)

Last night I dreamed I was cross-country skiing to Gavin and Pete's room in Taylor. They were sharing a room, I guess, and I had to get bandages for someone. I thought it was ok to leave the dorm after check-in since I was trying to help someone else. Mrs. Crank was prowling Taylor and caught me hiding under Pete's bed. Although I thought it was OK, I still felt like I was doing something wrong. So then I was sent home for breaking check-in, and my father got really mad at me and lecture me in front of the whole boys' varsity hockey team. I was really embarrassed. Then I was at the refuge in the mountains with him and the boys' hockey team. A bus stopped and Lou got out. His footsteps made so much noise because he had gotten fat over the summer. Then my father was reading an updated version of The Great Gatsby, which was actually about Lou and me, and everything worked out in the end, and no one died. My favorite passage about their first kiss and the tuning fork (in the real book), had been rewritten about LOU giving me this look and me crying because he was convinced that he didn't like me. But then we got together in the end. That night I had to clean up the refuge for dinner. I began sweeping and mopping and Sophia got mad at me because she thought she had cleaned earlier, and that I was only cleaning because I thought she had done a bad job. So she got really pissed off. That night there was a big winter carnival with all sorts of sports games going on. Caroline wanted me to come watch her swim meet, but I wanted to watch the boys' hockey game. I went and remembered seeing Lou skate out onto the ice. I guess I started a new dream, because I was all of a sudden drafted for some war against England. My canon was stuck and I was so terrified. Then I got shot in the leg. I somehow ran to a boat collecting people, and Lou was there too for Christ's sake. We ended up in the Bermuda Triangle, where we got lost. The compass pointed north no matter we turned, so we had no idea how to get anywhere. We ended up pretending we were Peter Pan and Captain Hook fighting, and then I woke up. (412 words)

Last night I dreamed that Jackson was a horse manager/dealer or something, and Jessica and I were riding his horses in some show. Before the show we had to paint the horses. Jessica only painted one side, and Jackson was really mad. So I defended Jessica by saying, "Just because you can't get with her doesn't mean you have to be mean to her!" That shut him up! Then we rode our horses upstairs to the chairs outside the history wing. My mother was there, as well as all these mountain goats. Ben kept teasing the goats. Then I woke up. (101 words)

I dreamed that Jenny had a skating accident. My brother went paintballing in Switzerland. I also dreamed that everyone from my Spain group was at the refuge, and this giant snake was slithering around the room and I was just freaking out. But then Tom told me it was OK, and that it was actually Ben who was the snake. Then Ben turned him into a human, and I was so relieved. He told me the history of this witch put a spell on him when he was two years old so that he could only be human half of his life, and then he had to be a snake for the other half. Megan and I thought that was very sad, and then I woke up. (127 words)

I dreamed that for final exams at my high school, we all had to ride this train. It was horrible. The driver was crazy and kept saying, "This train will not crash," but we were all still horrified. Then I had a dream that all of the kids on my Spain group went to the same high school I woke up on the first day and tried a million outfits, but ended up ruining them because I'd drop mascara on them. Then finally I put on jeans and a pink shirt and a jean jacket, before realizing that I shouldn't wear a jean jacket with jeans. On the bus to school, I saw the Chloes. Mr. Chloe was really happy about their new baby. It began to rain. At school I realized I had no makeup on. Then I woke up. (141 words)

When we got there, people started shooting paintballs at us, but they didn't hurt; they actually tickled! Althea and I still ran inside Bundy. When I got to my room, I realized that I didn't have my key. I started laughing because Ben was chasing me and tickled me when he caught me. Jessica was having her birthday party, but I had to stay at someone else's house. I called my father since I knew he was in the house where we are now. I asked him to call Hannah to ask if I could stay there. Then I saw Claudia, and just ended up staying with her.

I first dreamed that Sue and I lived on Bundy 3 and we wanted to go work out. I couldn't find shorts, but finally I did. I grabbed chapstick and my iPod and went to work out. While I was in the shower, Delia asked me to watch Zoey playing tennis downstairs. I thought that was really weird, and didn't care about going to watch tennis. I went home and got online. I was stuck online all night, and I just couldn't sign off --it was very frustrating. Then, all of a sudden, I was in Spain again with my family and I had to tell this Spanish guy a story about a man who ordered salmon, but really wanted soup, and had to change his order. I remember having a lot of trouble conjugating decir. So then our whole group was in Slate, which was in a huge hospital in the center of Madrid. Valerie was with Tom. We all had to shower in these old bathtubs before catching our flight home. When we got into the shower, I realized that I didn't have shampoo or conditioner or anything. I went through a mirror to get out and found myself in the middle of the hospital. I kept running around trying to find Slate so that I could catch my flight. My father was there too because he was trying to give me my mail before I left. And my brother was there too. We all started to climb this really unsteady driftwood ladder. We all fell, but my father caught me, and I was supposed to catch my brother, but I missed, and he fell so far. He just kept falling and falling and falling and cracked his skill when he hit the ground. I was crying so hard. We tried to bring him to the ER. He ended up going blind, never to play hockey again. I woke up because I was crying! Ahh! (327 words)

I knew Kylie went to school here, so I called her and told her to meet me at the boathouse, where she could help me. But then I was at the Olympics watching my brother swim. There was an ancient pool table, and you had to use swords instead of pool sticks. I had this major crush on Sam, but Jon liked me, and my father only wanted me to see Jon, not Sam. It was just a big mess! (107 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#179 (08/16/2004 (age 15))

I dreamed that I had moved back into Bundy with Camilia and we had an awesome room. Dorothy was our proctor and it just generally felt like it was going to be a good year. Then I had to go teach Sue and her dad how to play a combination of poker and gin right outside Langton. During the game, I realized that I had a field trip now. I ran back to the dorm and Sue was my roommate and all the furniture had been rearranged. I was really confused, but needed to pack for my field trip. I packed jellybeans and my ipod that was pink and also doubled as a hairdryer. Then I was home and had to get to school fast because I only had 2 minutes until 8am, when the bus for my field trip was leaving. My mother was pulling out of the driveway, and I kept waving at her to make her stop, and she finally did, but told me that if I wanted a ride I needed to get her the 2 Siamese kittens from the garden. I'm pretty sure I missed the field trip. Then I was a rabbit, and I was in the woods. The other rabbits were planning my funeral for the next day. They kept calling it my wedding though. I had decided myself though that I should have a funeral tomorrow though, because there was this bad rabbit that was going to hurt me. I was choosing the flowers before getting fed up with everything and just buried myself alive. How scary! (265 words)

I dreamed that the girls from my Spain program were al having a party in my old 6th grade classroom, which was actually my 1st grade classroom. Anyway, we were making a huge mess, and Jessica started ripping things off the wall. She kept saying something like, "Well it's not like the teacher's out there or anything." And of course, when I opened the door, Mrs. Montana was standing there and was very angry with us. She told us to clean everything up. I ate all her food and she just gave me a disappointed look, but I didn't care for some reason. Then I was at the beach with Alexis and Pauline, and Pauline had to come stay with me for 2 weeks. We were going to hang out and have fun! We were talking about our AP scores, and she got a 1, which I had found odd. Finally, I was online in the dining room where our piano is, and there was a huge storm outside. I was planning to meet all my friends at this baseball game, but the power kept going out, so I kept getting disconnected. I ran outside because I had to go save Mason. And then Anthony sent me a back-to-school package. (210 words)

I had a lot of dreams last night, about science class, oddly enough. The first was that Mr. Frank was my teacher and he had had another son and wanted me to go change its diaper. So Alexis and I brought him to the bathroom to change him. Right before we were leaving, though, I thought Alexis was holding onto him, so I let go and he fell, hit his head, and passed out. It was horrible. Then my final project for science was to do research on Jennifer Lopez, and present her success in terms of biology to a committee who wanted to figure out how to better market her. Anyway, I had forgotten my workbook, so I wasn't able to do that. Then Ross, from Friends, was my teacher, and he was leaving. I had had a crush on him or something, because I was really sad. He rocked me in his arms for a long time, and then left.

First, I dreamed that I was really numb all of a sudden. I was reading and then sort of seized up. Then I remember that I had had two shots of vodka, two Ibuprofens, and my mother's meds, and I had my period. So in really slow motion, I tried to get to bed to go to sleep. Next I dreamed that I was at the last boys' hockey game, and I had to say good-bye to all my friends. So first I said good-bye to Judith. And Mabel was there, but then she wasn't.

Then I said good-bye to Leo, Ida, Hazel, and Etta, and Wong, who tried to push me off the bleachers. Finally I said good-bye to Arthur, Bud, and Jayden. I looked on the ice and saw Lou, playing defense, and he accidentally let the puck by and spluttered, "It...it wasn't my fault." I felt bad for him and thought, There's so much I want to say right now that can't be said in a letter. Then, very sad, I looked at the rink one last time and left. At home, my father and I had to go get my brother from his hockey game. My father wanted me to drive to get used driving conditions. But before we left my computer malfunctioned and I had about 12 copies of every program on my desktop, which was really annoying. Then I woke up. (264 words)

It was my graduation (in my dream) and I had this white lacy dress that looked much better on the hanger than it did on me. It was see-through and you could tell that I was wearing my bright yellow Victoria's Secret underwear. So I ran up to my room in Bundy to change, when I ran into Mrs. Persky, who confessed to me she had 3 boyfriends she had been seeing. I excitedly followed her upstairs, where she said she was hiding one of them. But on the way up, someone had dropped her camera and everyone on the staircase got "camera poisoning." They were all rushed to the infirmary, where all the old senior boys were the doctors. Then I woke up. (124 words)

I dreamed that I was in some hospital waiting for my brother because he'd broken his arm. Then this guy (who was a lot older than I) sat down next to my father and me and began to flirt with me. My father got annoyed and told him to piss off, which he did. But then his friends came and tried to assault my mother. So I told the nurse, and she made them leave. Next, I found a scooter, and started scootering around the hospital. Then this little boy borrowed it from me and broke his leg. Later, I decided to give the scooter to him, before I realized that he was paralyzed for life. This made me cry. My next dream was that we came home from Italy and had 5000 phone messages, but they were all just recordings of Harry Potter. I tried to check my email, but my computer had broken. (155 words)

First I dreamed that Kylie and I went to another one of Jon's parties, this time with more people from my high school. There were so many people there that they made us get into two lines, 1 of boys, and 1 of girls. Whomever we matched up with next to us was our hookup partner for that night. I got someone gross, so Kylie and I left to go home and watch a movie. I went to work out the next day, and there was a hockey camp there. There were lots of boys in the gym, and I was a little intimidated. Finally, I dreamed that I was a beautiful princess and I was at the beach. I saw a Norwegian prince and we fell in love at first sight. But it was like Romeo and Juliet, and our parents didn't want us to be together, so we had to run away and hide at the New York Times, where I had to write an article about us eloping. (171 words)

First I dreamed that I was in Tudor England (the class), but I didn't have the right textbooks, so Mr. Bailey gave me his old ones. Then at the end of class, it was the last day of school, because I went back to my dorm room (which I shared with my brother for some reason), and then realized I needed to gather my stuff from everywhere else. So I went back to Tudor England to get my books, returned to my dorm room, and then needed to go back to get my yearbook. When I got back to the classroom, Ian was there, and he kept trying to kiss me. I think he might have if my father hadn't been there. Apparently my father and mother were taking us out to coffee to celebrate the end of the year. So he went to wait in the car. I said good-bye to Lucas and left. I ran into Willis, whom I had a long good-bye with. He told me his sister was hurt, and for the life of me, I couldn't remember her name. I kept thinking it was Amy, and not until I woke up did I remember it was Arlie. I got back to my room and my brother was packing. I had a million emails to read, but I deleted half of them. Just then, I heard a horn honking and knew it was my mother and father outside. They told us they were taking us somewhere in the city. I was reluctant to go because the next morning was the first day of the next school year. Before we left though, I had to return to elementary school to get my writing portfolio from 4th grade. After I found Mrs. Jones and got my writing portfolio, the guy who looked like Jude Law in the airport was there and said he loved my writing. The next day was proctor retreat and I had to swim in the lake with Tuck while Mrs. Carter told me being a proctor was a useless job anyway. (347 words)

First, I dreamed the 2005 prom was at our house. I got asked several times and ended up going with Lance. At the end, Lou got up to play a song (I was already over him) and he sang this beautiful love song to Marion. So that made me sort of sad, but I told myself I'd gotten over him anyway. And then Lance told me that it had actually been my name there in the song, but that Lou had changed it last minute because he didn't want me to know how he felt. So I decided to tell him instead. I knew he was in my brother's old room and the poor guy couldn't go to sleep because he was in there with some girl. I knocked on the door and said, "Excuse me, you can't be in there and you need to come out now. We won't watch you come out, but you need to." I was hoping that by hearing my voice, Lou would tell me he loved me. But instead he said, "We'll get out as soon as you make us a hotel reservation and bring us some fiber pills." At this, I thought my mother was in there because she takes fiber pills, so I wrenched the door open, and sure enough, Lou was lying there with my mother. Horrified, I slammed the door and started yelling, crying, and screaming. Lou didn't seem to care. I ran downstairs to get a phone book and threw it onto the bed yelling, "Make your own stinking, dirty hotel reservation" and all he did was laugh. I was so upset that I begged Sue to let me stay at her house. She was already having a sleepover with Hannah, so I slept in the living room. Mrs. Dunn made sure I had everything I wanted, and Mr. Dunn asked me about my college search. Sue had already gotten in somewhere, I think. The next morning we all went to Yuma, and I told them how everything was on sale. I bought a white bikini, and everyone else got shampoo and shoes. Olivia turned up later, back from Spain, but we didn't have any time to talk. Finally, I went home and on my computer was an IM chat from Tyler that said, "I can't help myself, or you." So I asked him what he meant, and he said he loved me. Then I woke up. (408 words)

First, I dreamed I was in Honors English and Mr. Winter was teaching us about hyperbole and metaphor. Allison needed a pencil, so I lent her one. Then we were all sitting in class and Mr. Winter called me on a phone at my desk and told me I had to tell Dorothy she was going to die in 3 hours. So I freaked out and started sweating and shaking and yelled to Dorothy to get to a hospital. Hannah was there, gossiping. Next we were all in the dining hall, and I was sitting with Alexis, Pauline, Faith, and Kylie. I was asking Faith and Kylie about the parties they had been to while I had been in Italy. (120 words)

I had a lot of dreams last night, the first being that I was in the mall in Rome with Isaiah, and we were going out, but I didn't really want to be going out with him. I couldn't figure out how to break up with him. My father wanted to take a book out of the library for me on James Dean, but it turns out he had to buy it since it was a Roman library or something. Next, we were all at school, but it was a girl's school and Mrs. Persky and Mr. Chloe were married. Hermione had hooked up with Sirius and then Sirius had died, like in Harry Potter. Everyone was really mad at Hermione. And then there were some other dreams in there about Lou. (132 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#219 (08/11/2005 (age 16))

Last night I had a dream that we were still in Italy on some secret boat chase. We docked in Rome and I got together with 30 other people my age, which I sort of knew, but not that well. Then we got home and had to go to school. I realized I was naked when I got to school, so I tired to stay behind and get dressed, but wasn't embarrassed at all. While I was trying to get into my pink corduroys and a white polo shirt, I thought of all the ways I could try to get Lou's attention. There was a puppy that was trying to attack me while I was getting dressed. Finally, we left the chapel and went outside where everyone was singing hymns. My mother had to call my father to discuss dinner plans, since I had a hockey game. I went to lunch and sat with Olivia. I noticed Andrea at the table next to Lou at a nearby table, so I rushed at Andrea screaming, and Lou noticed and Andrea got mad. Then I saw Valerie and Ashley. (187 words)

Last night I had the worst dream of my life. First I was near the senior steps by the back of the dining hall, and my brother fell and landed with what I kept repeating in my head as "a sickening crunch." It was horrible. He had to be dead. Then I came home and my father had to fight these monsters working with Voldemort in the lake. He had a gun that looked like the remote control, and he got frustrated when I couldn't understand how it worked. I cut up his purple and white boxers to use as Clothies, because I didn't know when I'd see him again. My mother was tanning on the deck and I went inside the kitchen to be sad about my father leaving. I noticed the creamer standing outside the pantry. Slowly, it turned to face me. I got so scared. Fritz was evil and rabid and working with this creamer, trying to prove that my mother and I were anorexic. I ran upstairs because I was so scared. I went into my brother's room and jumped into his bed, nearly hysterical with fear, begging him to let me sleep there. My brother had this nail in his back, which I guess was serving as his stitches. The evil Fritz came in with the creamer and ripped the nail out of his back, and I screamed. Apparently, the nail was a family heirloom of Slytherin. There was also a cactus on my brother's bedside table, and it was a Horcrux that Voldemort used. He recovered because all of a sudden, he and Russell and Ted and I were all on the run from Voldemort. We were running around London and my high school, which was in London, trying to escape. We ran into my room and my roommate was Ron. Hector was chasing us too. He wanted to kill my baby, because apparently I was pregnant. We are running everywhere and Ginny started to slow down. I started freaking out, but saw this French marching band on the Spanish Steps (I guess we got to Rome somehow). The band members were all dressed in brightly colored robes and were supposed to help us, but they didn't. They just kept playing their instruments and waving their flags. We tried to save my mother and get back to school. Then I was supposed to go on a date with Pete. This was right after hockey practice, so I went to the bathroom to try and primp myself. For some reason, I wet my pants, but it didn't matter. I came out and Ian began pouring his heart out, telling me I was the only one for him, and that he loved me. But I was still so scared that I ran to my high school and burst into tears and I woke up crying. (479 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#221 (08/28/2005 (age 16))

I dreamed that someone had sabotaged Andrea, so I invited her to my house so she could escape. Marion came with us and so did Gabby. Then we were at orientation in the music building, and I can't remember anything else. Then I was living somewhere between New York and my high school. Harvey was playing in a concert and wanted me to tell him I loved him, but I just ignored him. Jennifer Anniston wanted to go on a date with my parents. Then last year's seniors were doing "senior mauling," where they beat up all the underclassmen. Ian kept tickling me and we were laughing. Tyler saw us and got upset because Ian was talking to me. I found a secret passage underneath Slate, and I led Ian through it. Then I was in Chinese class with Jasper and I got a 90% on my homework. (148 words)
Bea 1: a high school student:#222 (08/30/2005 (age 16))

My first dream was that I was researching something in the library and it closed early, so I had to leave and go to lunch. The dining hall was huge --like the size of Grand Central. Gary was doing some sort of dance, and Sue was trying to talk to me while I got raspberry and mandarin orange flavored avocados. There was a live band there for some reason. Before I knew it, however, I was in New York babysitting this boy, Preston. He had myspace and 2 of his friends were coming over to play. But I couldn't find Preston. His friends arrived, a brown haired girl and a boy who looked much older than Preston. The boy was German and had an older brother my age. The brother was really cute and asked me to watch his brother for an hour or so. I gave up on Preston and watched the German boy instead. Finally the older brother came back after having coffee, and we all took the train back to my school's state. Then I went back to the city and was living in an apartment. Across the street Jennifer Garner taught 3rd grade. Ben Stiller was living with me and wanted to go to Jennifer's classroom. They met on the side of the street and she loved his poodle, Fluffy. They agreed to meet later for an ice cream. This train ran into my apartment and ruined everything. My mother and I were scrambling out. In the scuffle, we lost Fluffy, but we found Skye and Fritz, who were alive. We stepped onto the street and the cute German boy saw me. His mother thought I was Swedish. My brother was hanging around by the train wreck, and my father, my mother, and I all drove over to take him away. He wanted to show off in front of Francine and her friends, so he hopped in backwards through the window. Then I woke up. (329 words)

Last night, I first dreamed that we were getting new flavors of ice cream in the snack bar. I was in the library with Sue when we found this out. Mr. Chloe wanted us to babysit. So we did, but then we had to leave to go bake cookies or something. Then it was the last day of school, and everyone rushed out of main building to the music building, where we had to listen to a concert. Everyone kept sliding down the side of the hill. All of a sudden, I was in the alumni house with a Spanish home stay family (and I communicated with them in Spanish in my dream). Margo was there and we were looking for ice cream, before I realized I had to be babysitting. I ran into the main building and went down to the English wing, where there was a talk about college. The bell rang and I had to run up to the history wing, where I knew no one. Then I woke up. (173 words)

Last night I dreamed that I was back at school, but it was a combination of my high school and my college . I was having my English seminar with Clark, but James and Ed were there. Then I was naked, but I had to go to philosophy where we were reading Wittgenstein. I was horrified that I was naked, but no one seemed to notice. Then it got dark and I couldn't find my way back to the dorm. Then I woke up. (84 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#002 (04/06/2007)

Last night I dreamed that I was in the gym and was really anxious to check mail because I was waiting to hear from a study abroad program and a teaching program, for some reason. I found out I had been accepted to the teaching program and was really excited to tell Aaron. When he looked at my letter though, we realized that it was only a solicitation for an application, not an acceptance. I was really embarrassed. Then I woke up. (82 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#003 (05/26/2007)

I had a dream that I was at the Caan dining hall, which was actually my high school's dining hall. I don't remember why I was there. Aaron was there to see Britta. I saw Britta and kept trying to get a better look at her. I remember being disappointed by the cereal selection. I called Tyler to help me with the cereal. And then I saw Aaron again right before I woke up. (74 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#004 (05/27/2007)

I had a dream that I was a senior at my high school again. Newsom, Ben, Lee, Sue, everyone was there. It was the last few days before we were about to graduate. Lou, Adam, and Julian showed up. I think Pauline was there too and we all had lunch. Before that I had a dream that I had missed all my math classes and also didn't have the textbook, so I couldn't even catch up. I went to the dance studio, where there was a soundproof room, so I could blast whatever music I wanted. I wanted it as loud as it went. I started listening to AC/DC and pretended to play the air guitar. And then I got an email from Aaron, in my dream, which I thought I had gotten in real life. (136 words)

Last night I dreamed I was holding Fluffy and she had all sorts of things inside her, like a stuffed mouse that I had to keep track of. It was my high school graduation again but everyone was running around somewhere, like a street in Spain. Then there were these huge...pods, or something in the sky where we had to sleep, like out of The Matrix or something. I went up to one with a guy Martin, who looked like someone from The O.C. We were up there trying to sleep and it started raining. Martin wanted to have sex, but I didn't, but I was afraid to say no. I left the pod, but he followed me, and I became really afraid. But then he left and I woke up. (131 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#006 (06/09/2007)

Last night I dreamed that I was at some combination of my high school and my college and there was an end of the year spring dance. I was hanging out with Kim, Jessica, and Julian beforehand. My date was someone from my high school, but I can't remember who it was. Some boys from my high school were there. I was really anxious because I thought I was being stood up. I had bought a really flashy, silver dress that was really low cut, and I guess I only just realized that it was too low cut. Then I woke up. (102 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#007 (06/12/2007)

I had the worst dream last night. First it started out OK: Aaron and I were fooling around somewhere, and I was really happy and excited. Then I went home and in the guest room was my brother and Lauren. They had been playing some game with a baby, but they accidentally dropped her when I came in. The baby started bleeding everywhere and it was really scary. I was trying to keep her alive with ice and by holding her upright, and my brother and Lauren were really scared. The baby was OK, so I went downstairs to the kitchen to hang out with Judith and my father before prom. I was really happy because Aaron was taking me. So then right before I was about to leave, I asked where my mother was so I could say goodbye to her. My brother looked at me very pityingly and said that our mother had died last night. I laughed because I thought he was joking but he was serious and I demanded why no one had told me. He said because there hadn't been a good time. I started crying so hard and was hugging Aaron really tightly. He kept saying, "I'm really sorry, but if it came down to your mother or your sister, aren't you glad your sister's alive?" I guess he was referring to the baby who was OK after all the bleeding. All I could think was, She's not my sister! It was horrible. (249 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#008 (06/23/2007)

My dream was really weird last night. First I was living in an apartment with 4 other girls and 5 other guys. I was trying to make everyone go to sleep, but Jessica had a tennis match and was making a lot of noise. Then there was another guy with long dirty blonde hair, sort of like a California surfer. I guess we had been dating for a while. He was hugging me and saying, "I'm surprised I haven't broken you yet." And I got really scared because I did not want to be with him. I suggested we make oatmeal (in order to distract him). He poured his down the sink, which hurt my feelings for some reason. Finally, my father, my mother, and I were all driving in New Haven, but my father couldn't drive properly, so my mother had to take over. Weird. (146 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#009 (07/04/2007)

My dream last night was that it was spring gala at my college, but it was actually at my high school 's hockey rink, which was located right in the middle of Manhattan. There was a lot of confusion surrounding the event: first, I had forgotten my dress but had no way of getting home to retrieve it; My mother was be really unhelpful; Jessica was trying to call me, but my phone wouldn't work, and the whole time I am just trying to get my dress. I somehow managed to shower and get ready, and even timed my arrival at the rink properly so that I was neither too early, nor too late. I soon realized, however, that I had put no eye makeup on, so I scrambled through my bag looking for mascara and eyeliner. I ran to the bathroom. In my dream, I thought I looked great in my shiny silver dress and strappy high heels, even though I would probably wear neither of those items in real life. So I finished applying eye makeup and tried to find Aaron. I had been looking forward to gala for a while because I wanted to be with him. On the bleachers of the rink was every guy from my high school. But I was frustrated because I only wanted to see Aaron, but instead I could only see every guy from high school. I kept hoping he would just find me and pull me away. And even as I started waking up, I tried to stay asleep to see if I would ever find Aaron, but I never did. It was almost as if I knew my conscious self couldn't see him, so I wanted my unconscious side to compensate for the absence. (295 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#010 (07/09/2007)

I had the worst dream last night: that Aaron and Britta got back together. Aaron really wanted me to meet Britta, and I wanted to meet her, but it was really upsetting for me to see them together. They were kissing and cuddling and laughing right in front of me, and I could tell they were really in love. Britta would talk, and Aaron would just gaze at her, and I felt so...wasted. I was so upset and mad, but I wanted Aaron to be happy too. And Britta was smart and pretty; I felt like I couldn't compare. I got so fed up and couldn't watch them together, so I left. Then I woke up. (116 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#011 (07/17/2007)

Last night I had a dream that I was first reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and it was taking place in space. I kept trying to stay asleep so I could read it, since it wasn't really coming out for a while. Then Andrea and I were at the ocean, and she accidentally let my hand go, and I was floating in the middle of the ocean. The crew team came and saved me. Then I was back at my college and moving in for the year, clearing out drawers and closet space. It was really bizarre because my brother knew all these people that I did. (109 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#012 (07/22/2007)

Last night I had a dream about Aaron and Britta again. It was similar to the last dream I had about them, in that Aaron wanted me to be friends with Britta, and he didn't try to hide her or anything to spare my feelings. He just outright showed affection for her and everything. And again, I just felt so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to make myself feel better or change the situation, because I wanted to be with Aaron, but I also wanted to stay friends with him, so I had to be friends with Britta. The dream was odd though because Britta wasn't a pretty blonde girl, but rather a tiny Vietnamese girl. And I liked her. And even though she was the Britta, Aaron's Britta, there was some part of her that secretly wasn't. It was weird, but I knew this to be true. Anyway, this is all so stupid because it shows that I am just anxious about seeing Aaron again and worried that he will have gotten back with Britta. (177 words)

I had the weirdest dream last night! I was just hanging out with Chandler, and then we had sex! And I didn't want to tell him it was my first time, but of course he found out when I started bleeding. It was awful and afterward I hadn't wanted him to be my first, so I was really upset. Then I was trying to throw a party, but too many people came, and it was just so weird and I was really happy to wake up! (86 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#014 (07/28/2007)

I had a really bad dream last night. I was back at my high school and trying to go to the gym. For some reason all the teachers and a lot of the students hated me and thought I was a bitch. I couldn't understand why, but it felt horrible for everyone to dislike me so much. I think I finally did make it to the gym, and everyone there was really rude to and mad at me because I was wearing my tennis skirt, and I guess that was offensive. It was a silly dream, but it felt awful to be disliked, and I wanted to go back and rewrite whatever it was I had done to become so unpopular. (121 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#015 (07/31/2007)

Last night I had the worst dream that my mother died. It was honestly the worst dream I had ever had. I had been talking to her two days before, and I somehow knew she had died, which made me hysterical when the police showed up at the front door to tell us officially. And I guess I had known that when I had been talking to her before hadn't been real, like some sort of recording. But I started screaming and crying so hard and convulsing when I found out she had died, because I had remembered telling my father how lucky I felt that no one I loved had ever died and it was really only a matter of time before someone did. I just kept wishing and hoping that I could talk to her one last time. I would have given anything to see her and hear her voice just one last time. I was so so so so happy when she crawled into bed with me and I started crying because I had been so scared! (180 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#016 (08/07/2007)

Last night I had a really weird dream. First, my college was inside some sort of mall and the gym was also a music room. When you biked or ran, the machine produced music based on how well you were exercising. So I guess I was in there with Aaron and Rick and others when the music my machine was making started sounding really bad. I was trying to find a way to fix it, but Rick, Aaron, Jasper, Mandy, and Buddy all started squirting water bottles at me, which was funny for the first few seconds, but then got annoying. I began to cry and finally escaped. I climbed up this stepladder to a room with a glass-domed ceiling so you could see all the stars. There was light, soft music, and couples dancing slowly. I saw Aaron alone, looking up at the stars. Something told me he didn't want to be disturbed. I felt sad and left. (159 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#017 (08/10/2007)

I had such a realistic dream last night. First it was my last day at my job, and for some reason I was having trouble figuring out my time card. I couldn't add the hours up properly or something. I guess I figured it out though. Then the blonde girl upstairs (the one who reminds me of Aaron's Britta) was crying because her boyfriend's mother had died. So then I walked home (my job was near my house I guess), and on the way I heard someone putting down women. I ran over and started shouting at them before I realized it was Jackson. I later learned that he was speaking at his mother's funeral, and that I had misunderstood what he had said. I found him later that night to apologize, and he took me in his arms and kissed me. And I kissed him back and we were hugging and grabbing at each other. I was trying to remember if we had been doing this same thing years ago and just continuing it now, or if this is the first time it had happened. I must have thought it was the first time, but in any event, things began to heat up really fast and I remembered we were supposed to be at a funeral, so we broke apart. And then we were sitting in a golf cart, and I felt so...in love. No one around me mattered. I kept fixing his tie or holding his hand. Gabby (random) saw us and either was jealous of me, or wanted to protect Aaron from getting hurt, because she really disapproved of Jackson and me. I wanted to come back later to continue hooking up with Jackson, but when I got home I realized that I had to go back to school right away. Everything was so real though. (309 words)

I woke up angry this morning because of my dream. It was a situation like in Blindness, where we all lost hearing instead of sight. It was total chaos. I somehow found my whole family in this huge city and was crying and kissing them and telling them how much I loved them. I got separated from them for a bit, but I guess I found friends and we all did homework together. Then we were lying down, and not surprisingly, Aaron was next to me. My father had told me earlier that he didn't like Aaron, and I told him that it didn't matter because Aaron and I were no longer dating. Lying there, however, Aaron and I were together again and we were touching and kissing until another girl came and lay down next to him. Then he forgot about me and went on touching her. I was really annoyed and left and woke up annoyed! (158 words)

Last night I first had a dream that I was kidnapped and being held hostage in the woods. Our cell phones wouldn't work, and the people who had kidnapped us had taken our kayaks and paddles. My next dream was that I was playing hockey with my women's club team, but something was wrong, like one of the girls wasn't allowed to play. Then I was in the dining hall and I think Michelle had died because I kept crying every time I tried to eat. Then I was on an Outing Club trip with Jessica, Kim, Sydney, and Abigail. Rem and Kat and left behind all our spandex, so we were really embarrassed that we had nothing appropriate to wear. Alec tried to help us find them, which didn't make it all any less embarrassing. But then I think in the end we all went snowshoeing. (147 words)

I dreamed last night that I was hooking up with Aaron after a Halloween party. I was really frustrated because I had promised myself I wasn't going to do that anymore. But just as I decided that, we got naked and I didn't care anymore. Now, I decided, I would finally have sex. I was so happy to be with him again and he was making me laugh and feel so comfortable. I was finally ready. But then I was back at school and trying to organize all my shoes. For some reason I had a lot of shoes. Then I woke up. (103 words)

I had a strange dream within a dream kind of thing last night. I guess I was doing psych research or something with this boy and his mother, but there dreams were so real that they would wake up and have things fro the dream. I went into the boy's dream and he was remembering when his father was riding a horse and had really scared him (the little boy). I can't remember the mom's dream, but it was something more related to my life. It was scary for those dreams to be so real, even though they weren't mine. And I had to get out of their dreams first before I could get out of my own dream. I had to consciously wake myself up. (126 words)

I dreamed last night that I was back working for my job in the art books section. The department was located in some old ruined dorm at my high school. Yet I was somehow very close to the Alps and everywhere else in Europe. I had to snowboard throughout Europe (which was tricky enough since I can't snowboard) and steal art for my job in exchange for cocaine. And I don't know why but I was trying to acquire 40 grams of it. Aaron was there and was talking to Britta, even though he had come to visit me. I sent them on a tour of Europe to keep them busy while I tried to find the 40 grams of cocaine. Then I woke up. (125 words)

I had a dream last night that there was a second rink at my college and that all these guys were playing a new kind of hockey. They weren't skating, but instead they ran around with large oversized crayons, whacking a ball around on the floor. Sam had brought me, but I didn't want to play. I just wanted to watch. Philip was there, but I can't remember why. At one point, Sam tried to get me a crayon so I could play, and I think Philip was jealous. The rink was the deepest shade of green I have ever seen (or imagined). And the "ice" was yellow. And the rink was a sort of dank and deserted place, but there were secret rooms and an elaborate system of staircases. But this shade of green just seemed too dark to be real, but I remember knowing that it was green. (150 words)

I had a strange dream last night. First, I went back for RA training. At night we were watching a movie in an opera house. No one was allowed to eat any candy besides Starbursts. Mario was getting really mad at anyone who was talking. Next, I was going to a sleepover with all my old roommates from last year and my brother. Sophia was as annoying as ever, but I was trying to get along with her and be diplomatic. Then I was living in an attic in South America, where they had slaves. I had to take a really long train ride to get down there, and I kept trying to send Anthony letters, asking him to rescue me, but I couldn't spell his address correctly. The woman at the post office kept getting mad at me. When I got there, there was a bullfight. And then someone bought me a pair of those footie pajamas. But I really didn't like the bullfight, but I just couldn't figure out how to leave. (174 words)

I first dreamed that I was going to New York with Sue and Ava. Maria was tagging along. We all went to CVS before we left to get snacks and nail polish. We were driving to the city in this awful stick shift car, and Maria was trying to get us to bake her a cake since it was her birthday. I think we ended up not making it to the city, and instead I had RA training again. But it was summer this time. I was eating breakfast at Heinz, and it was very crowded because all the athletic teams were there. I could hear Mario's voice. All the new RAs had to do a dance as initiation, and I was laughing. I remember seeing Philip and Ainsley and Roberto and Mario. Also Enrique Iglesias was there. There were paintings all over this whole room, really beautiful paintings. I was talking to someone about art and hockey and Les Miserables. I remember being really hot because I was dressed in warm clothes and it was August, and I woke up sweating. (182 words)

I keep having these vivid, sick, and twisted nightmares about people I love or trust dying or being brutally murdered. I know it's weird and it's not something I'm consciously worrying about; it's just hard to be so far from home. (41 words)

I had the strangest dream last night about Tony. He wanted to date me and was getting to know my family and help around the house. He really wanted to get on my mother and my father's good sides. (39 words)

I had the most ridiculous and vivid dream yesterday. I was dreaming that Kit had a girlfriend (a gorgeous blond girl) and she was sitting on his lap. We were in some room with a ton of other people watching The Office. I kept trying to be funny and make comments during the show to get his attention, but he kept rolling his eyes at me and scoffing and being generally quite icy to me. So I left because I was sick of flirting with him and getting rejected. I was walking on the street. I was with 4 other guys from my program, not specific guys, but I just knew they were on my program. They were laughing and joking and then I told them about how that guy the other week had harassed me on the street and hit me. Then they all started harassing me and grabbing and hitting me too. I freaked out and told them to stop, but they continued slapping me, so I started crying and ran up the street and straight into Jayden's arms. He hugged me and asked what was wrong. I was crying and he kissed me so hard and told me it would be okay. I was confused as to why he was kissing me when he had been pretty rude earlier. He said he hadn't wanted to flirt with me in front of his girlfriend. (236 words)

I had a dream that made me feel like I was cheating on Clayton. I was sitting in a chairlift going downhill, backwards. It was dark and warm all around me, even though I think I knew it should have been cold and snowy. Kit was sitting next to me, his arm around me, and his five o'clock shadow rubbing against my cheek as he nuzzled me. I felt my entire body tensing, gathering energy, pulsing and warm. I squeezed his knee with my right hand; I have a distinct memory of digging my nails into his thigh to release the pressure. The tension was building and I just waited for everything to snap. The dark began to dissolve around a tiny yellow light that brightened in front of me. The light grew and shrank, grew and shrank, grew and shrank until it overwhelmed the darkness, and I was twisting and squirming and grabbing his leg and having an orgasm. And when I woke up I felt like I had cheated on Clayton. (173 words)

I had an orgasm in my dream last night, and I'm pretty sure I had one in real life too. I was lying on a beach and some guy, I don't know who, was touching me. We weren't having sex; he was just touching me. He was kneeling over me and holding onto this sword. Whenever he pushed his sword deeper into the sand, he touched me a little deeper. The phallic imagery is pretty obvious, but we weren't actually having sex. Anyway, it kept going like this until I had an orgasm and woke up from it. My god! (100 words)

I had a dream that memories and dreams weren't allowed. There was a secret service that went around and erased peoples' memories. There was a way to hide if you had any memories, though, and I tried to figure out what it was. I was terrified that they would erase all my dreams, my past, my memories, so I tried to pretend I was blank and had already been erased. Then they went into my room in Fenster and tried to rip up my pillows and comforter to find my dreams. Ugh, it was awful! (95 words)

I had a dream that I was engaged or betrothed to marry Wyatt, without really knowing it. I think I woke up on my wedding day and had all these things to do. I think I had some recollection in my dream of having been proposed to. And at the time I was thinking, Well, I could do a lot worse. But I'm only 21. Do I really want to get married this early? Does he even love me? And we haven't even had sex yet. What if it's not good? Anyway, I said yes anyway. So that day I had to buy presents for My mother and my father, because that was some sort of new tradition. Wyatt and I were riding in a limousine to go to the store, and I just kept thinking, This is so unfair. He still gets another year of college, and I will have graduated and will have to pay his tuition. I can't do that! And what if he hooks up with other girls while he is at school and I am working? We got to the store and I bought finger puppets for my mother and father. When I got home, all my underwear was strung up on a line hanging outside the door. I wasn't embarrassed, since Wyatt was going to be my husband, but I also didn't understand why it was strung up there. My mother had told me she had made all the arrangements for the wedding, which I suppose made my decision easier, since I didn't have to think about anything. All I know is that my father spent $160,000.00 on the wedding, which I felt bad about, since I don't even really remember having ever gotten engaged or telling them about it. I kept thinking that I was only 21 and had so much more to do in life. At the same time, Wyatt was a good guy and I could certainly learn to love him. On the way to the beach where we were supposed to get married, it started snowing. So that upset me, since the wedding was supposed to be outside. All the flowers were dead when we got there. And I didn't have a wedding dress. I guess that was my only responsibility, but since I had no idea about this wedding, I didn't realize I had to get a dress. So I ran away, and just kept running, away from everyone at the beach. I ran into my father, who was on his way over and I started crying and said I was so sorry he had spent all that money, but that I couldn't get married. I woke up, panicked, and so happy that I wasn't married. (457 words)

Last night I had a dream that I was swimming in the river in Van Gogh's Starry Night Over the Rhone. It was cold and windy, but the water was warm. There were islands that were actually paintings, and sometimes I wanted a break, so I would grab onto the paintings, but then the oil would run and the canvas was ruined. (62 words)

I had a dream that I was dressed up in different Halloween costumes, except I was part of some Avatar world where people were trying to kill me. Bryson and I were running around trying to hide by putting different costumes on. Then I went back to school, where I weighed myself and realized I had gained 65 pounds over winter break. I was horrified and upset. Maybe it's just the costume that weighs so much, I thought, but I knew that it wasn't. (84 words)

Last night I had a dream that I had to go to Japan with my mother for some reason. We drove to the airport, which was at my high school, and I was able to pack everything into this small DVD case. I asked if we were going to drive to California and fly from there, or if we were just going to drive to JFK and fly from there. My mother said it would be better to just drive to JFK. We got onto the plane, and even though the flight was supposed to be 12 hours, we were only going for 1 day. When we got to Japan, I remember that instead of all the skyscrapers, there were these incredible trees from Avatar. They had these phosphorescent leaves that lit up depending on the season. I guess all the seasons went by in the 1 day we were in Tokyo, because the leaves changed from pink, to orange, to green, to blue, which was supposed to indicate a whole year going by. They were beautiful against the night sky. On the way home, my brother and my father joined us, and we all went to a dentist's office together. I don't know why, but apparently the dentists were better in Japan. The dentist spoke English, but all the magazines in the waiting room were in Japanese. The "dentist" was eating yogurt and a Snickers bar, which I remember thinking was weird, since he was a dentist and shouldn't eat candy. This "dentist" turned out to be an old friend of my mother and father's, and we stayed at his house for another night for a party. The dentist was an older man, and I found him very attractive, even though I don't find older men attractive in real life. He was putting all this food on the tables to occupy everyone, and then he cornered me and started flirting with me. I think I had been drinking wine, because I felt a little giddy and flirtatious too. He was wearing a gray suit and looked very sharp. Then I woke up. (353 words)

My first dream was that I was on a show like America's Next Top Model with all my girlfriends. We had to do different tasks or photo shoots before one of us was eliminated. I remember being worried because everyone else had really elaborate outfits, and I was only wearing a black t-shirt. One of the judges in the audience came up to me and asked if I was in another ethnic group. I told her I was in my ethnic group, but she still wrote down another ethnic group on my info sheet. Then Abigail and I were taking a break from the photo shoots and we went to the library, where we ate dried mangoes and peanut M&Ms. The next morning we all had to take showers, and I had 3 sponges, but no soap, so I wasn't able to. In my next dream I was skiing with my family somewhere, but I still needed a new winter coat. My mother and I were going to go shopping. I think it was Christmas or Thanksgiving or something, because this old woman was there and she was supposed to be my grandmother, but she wasn't. My father was making apple pie shaped into funny faces. My brother was making chocolate butter cream frosting. I had two pieces of this incredible cake (it tasted so good in my dream) before I felt like a pig and was so glad I had only eaten that in my dream and not in real life. My mother and I left for the mall. The car was parked in the backyard instead of in our driveway, but anyway. I tried on lots of different coats, but they only had sizes 29 and 32, which I don't even think are real sizes in women's coats. I ended up not finding anything and left. When I got home I had to baby sit some random family I've never met before. I brought 101 Dalmatians coloring books and two boxes of crayons, because I guess I knew there was a little girl who would want to color. When the parents came home, they were congratulating me on being accepted to medical school. The kid's uncle had three heads, and I tried not to stare. Then I woke up. (381 words)

Last night I had a series of weird dreams. First, Sydney and I were in our room and we were part of some game show with some of our friends and other random people I don't remember. Every time we got a question right, we took shots of vodka together. Mario was there too and kept warning us to be careful. Later, I was in Adam's with Sydney, Jillian, and Reese. We were trying to decide when we should go get sushi for dinner. I think it was after final exams, because I was running on a treadmill in Adam's, and didn't have a care in the world. Next, there was some sort of funeral or memorial. All the boys on the hockey team were wearing the same team tie, and had to recite a piece of a eulogy for this person who had died. I remember seeing Trevor and saying something about him to my father. He told me that Trevor wasn't his real last name; rather it was "Sierra" and he just went by Trevor because it sounded manlier. Although I was shocked, I think I knew this. I felt out of place that I did not have this blue silk team tie, or the equivalent, and I also wondered why I was at this memorial, since I didn't seem to know who had died. Next I was in a building in Manhattan somewhere. I had ordered pizza and the delivery guy was doing a dance outside my window. A-Wall was there too. We were hunting around in our garden (inside the apartment) looking for a plant that would in ten years grow to be my husband. Then I woke up. (283 words)

I had a dream that my family and I were all going somewhere, but I can't remember where it was or why we were all there. My mother and I wanted to go home early, so we took one of the cars. We were at a rest stop, when I realized that we had somehow taken both cars, but I hadn't been driving. My mother said she had been driving each car in shifts, because they were both some kind of new stick shift I didn't know how to drive yet. I was also dreaming about floating down some river with other RAs, and that was our mid-year training. Later, Gage and I were talking, and he was telling me about how every couple in our grade was breaking up before graduation. I was shocked, but really relieved that I wouldn't have that same problem.

I had a really elaborate dream last night that took place sometime in late May/early June, right between final exams and senior week before graduation. I think I was commuting between my home state and my college state for that last week because I was both at home and at my college . I think first, we had some big party to kick off senior week, but we also had something early the next morning, so people were trying to get to sleep. I was in a huge bedroom with Lyla, some other girls I can't remember, Miley, and Adam. I think Susanna was there too (in the abstract, not physically there), but she and Adam had broken up, or something. In any event, Adam was sleeping next to me in this bed, and he was tickling me and flirting with me, and I was trying to be quiet since everyone else wanted to go to sleep. Javier was there too, and some boy who introduced himself to me as "Lacrosse." Next, I was at home, and maybe my brother was graduating from high school again or something, because I was baking him a cake. It was a long, rectangular sheet cake with blue icing. I ran out of icing, so I had to make more, but no matter how much butter, cream cheese, or powdered sugar I put in, it tasted disgusting and came out this terrible shade of maroon. Finally I gave up, and just colored (with a blue marker) the parts that didn't have icing. Also, I remember it being extremely dark outside, even though it was early in the day. Maybe there was some kind of solar eclipse? So then I had to get back to my college , and my father told me I could bike there; it would take 2 hours to get to one town, and then I would have to walk 30 miles to the college town. This was crazy to me, and I couldn't understand how I was supposed to do that. I guess I got up there though, because there I was again in a Lily Pulitzer dress, flouncing around. There was a beautiful abstract expressionist painting on the wall, with the initials W.K. I knew it was Kandinsky, even though it didn't really look like his work. I think maybe it was some new, undiscovered painting, but it was beautiful --I wish it existed in real life! All of a sudden I was back at home again, asleep in my bed. I was dreaming (in my dream) that the reason Adam had picked Susanna over me was because she had sex with him, and I wouldn't. I guess in my dream this had happened to me a different time with a different guy, so it was a huge revelation. I woke up (in my dream) and got out of bed. I started applying black eyeliner to my eyes (I wanted to make Adam realize he should have chosen me) before realizing I hadn't washed my face or anything. Then there was a knock on my door, and I said, "Hold on!" while I grabbed a light blue robe (which I do not own) out of my closet. I opened my door and my father was there saying that my brother really needed us (I can't remember why), so I should probably not go back to my college today. Although Adam and my college and graduation had been on my mind only 20 seconds ago, I nodded fervently and said that yes of course I would stay at home if my brother needed me. My father said it was 10:30, so we should get going (to where, I don't know). Then I woke up in real life, and it was only 9:30, and my father had already left for work. (640 words)

I had the worst dream last night. It started out that I was at a party somewhere in some basement, at my college, but at a place that definitely doesn't actually exist. It was a huge labyrinth and very dingy and dimly lit. At the beginning, the party was fun. People were playing Beirut and there was music. I think it might have been a costume party because I think I was wearing a bumblebee or some other bug costume. Erick was there looking for me. I couldn't find him, but everyone else I saw told me he was looking for me. I saw notes written by him looking for me, notes like, "Bea, meet me upstairs." Anyway, the dream turned into a nightmare very quickly. All of a sudden we were running away from the building. It was daylight outside. People were screaming and running in every direction to avoid these gigantic machine monsters that were shooting people down like in District 9. Nora and I were trying to hide underneath a white plastic tarp. I was breathing so quickly and was so scared. I heard the machine's voice saying, "I can see your blue shoe underneath that white tarp. Come out now." I wondered if just maybe Nora was wearing blue shoes too, but she wasn't, and I knew the monster was calling for me. I waited until I thought maybe he had gone and then ran out to find my next hiding spot. I hid behind a wooden shed, but the second I peered around to see where the monster was, it shot me in the arm. It was really painful! I thought for sure I was going to die. All of a sudden I was lying on a gurney and being rushed back into the basement, which was no longer the site of a party, but a makeshift hospital. I couldn't move or speak, but I could hear the "doctors" around me saying I had almost no time to live, and discussing how they should take my organs now while they were still fresh. I was horrified and tried to speak to tell them that I was going to be fine, but they started draining blood and taking my organs. I don't remember the gory details, but I woke up in the same position (in my dream) after they had supposedly taken all my body parts. When I came to, however, I felt fine, as if nothing had happened. Even my costume was still intact. I was so happy I leapt off the gurney and raced around following the notes Erick had left me until I ran straight into him. I was so happy, but he looked terrified. He said we had to get out of here immediately. He brought me to some beautiful library with dark paneled walls, gorgeous built in shelves, and thousands and thousands of books. There were beautiful leather chairs, brass desk lamps, and huge skylights for the roof. It was dark and snowy outside, but cozy and warm inside. My whole family was there watching some National Geographic program about Siberian tigers. I started chatting online with Erick and some other friends. What was weird was that Erick was able to talk to me, but it was as if my other friends were ignoring me. I told Erick this and he said, "It's because you're dead." I distinctly remember my heart dropping as I realized this. He said that the only reason I could see him too was because the same thing had happened to him after he had been shot, and since we were both dead, we were on "the other side" and could talk to each other, but people who were still alive couldn't hear us. I guess I thought my family had been too absorbed in the TV to say anything to me when I got home, so I tried to see if they would acknowledge me now. I tried talking to my mother and brother separately, and then yelling at the top of my lungs "I AM GOING TO KILL MYSELF" to see if that would get their attention. But Erick seemed to be right; they just couldn't hear me. I started crying and ran upstairs, which was my room, even though we don't have a library like that in our house. I found my hairbrush, which I also knew to be some kind of sniper rifle, and ran into my room to shoot myself. If I died again, it means I was actually alive, but if nothing happened, then I must be dead. It was the most horrifying feeling and I kept trying to wake myself up. I literally said to myself "Bea, wake up! Wake up! This can't be real!" I looked into my full-length mirror and shot myself in the temple twice. I heard the gunshot and felt the excruciating pain, but got up right after I had shot myself. I started sobbing, since I was really dead. I ran back to the basement where all that stuff had happened, hoping to find someone who could bring me back to life. I was crying and screaming and trying to find anyone who would listen to me for just a minute. I hadn't said goodbye to anyone, and all I needed was a few days on "the other side" so I could talk to the living. It was so horrible, and every time I tried to wake myself up, I couldn't, so I just decided that I must have not been dreaming. And then I woke up, thank GOD! (934 words)

Last night my dreams were not my own. I was confused and utterly clueless throughout the whole series. First I was in Mexico at the beach and stuck on some sort of movie set. Some blond girl was running around for a scene, so all the exits were closed off so people wouldn't come in. For some reason, I was trapped on the wrong side of this barrier, and all I wanted to do was go back to the beach. It was so warm and sunny that I was almost shocked when I woke up that I wasn't in Mexico. All of a sudden I was transported to some humungous house in the south of France with Abigail. There was a family there, but it wasn't my family and it wasn't Abigail's. Someone had some kind of disorder, and the family was making a video to send to a committee to get better hospital care for their kid. I was thrown into the middle of it, wearing some sort of costume, and having utterly no idea why I was there. Then Abigail and I were made to go shopping. We found a Wal-Mart (in the south of France). While we were shopping, Abigail started stealing other people's groceries that they had already paid for. The manager of the store caught us, but Abigail managed to get away. She caught me and started interrogating me. I began to cry until she said, "I know it was your friend, not you, so I'll let you go if you find her and turn her in." I didn't know what to do and only prayed that Abigail had run far enough away that I wouldn't find her and have to turn her in. Then I was in a classroom somewhere with Edwin and we were laughing and joking about something. Then I was at a ball somewhere wearing a long silver dress and Philip was trying to call me. I didn't want to talk to him so I snapped my phone in two. Then I realized I wasn't wearing a bra and became really self-conscious. Finally, there was some dog who was trying to follow me around, and I realized it was someone named Doug, a person I have never actually met in real life, but whom I knew in my dream to be my soul mate, who had the ability to transform into a dog. It was so strange and I honestly felt like I was just walking through a world of other people's dreams! (422 words)

I had a dream last night that I was back in my high school dining hall and Tony was there. My brother was there too and he was trying to get my attention, but I didn't realize. I was wearing a black dress and I think I had an exam or somewhere important to be. I also had to finish a book before wherever I was next going. (68 words)

I had a dream that I had accidentally booked spring break in Russia, instead of Mexico. When I got there, my father and I had to buy down vests, and all I wanted was for it to be warm. We were on a train to go shopping, but then I was on some pier in Brooklyn. Roberto was there and we were holding hands and walking down the pier. I jumped into the water, but it turns out it was actually this motor oil that could kill me. I was spluttering and swallowing the oil and trying to swim to the dock. I ended up spitting in real life, trying to get the oil out of my mouth in my dream. Then I was running on a staircase that was like the Guggenheim, except it was 14 stories. I tried to climb up the stairs, but the building was jello-like and really difficult to stand up. Anthony was there and he was so cute, and I felt like I was 14 all over again. (174 words)

I can't remember the exact order of my dreams. I think first I was going back to the city in Spain, where I studied abroad. We landed and immediately went to the Reina Sofia. There was a Willem de Kooning and Goncharova exhibit, except instead of their paintings, they were frescoes that were attached to the wall. And despite this, the paint still stuck out in thick brushstrokes. It was beautiful. The frescoes were oddly shaped, sort of like Frank Stella pieces, and they were all over the walls and ceiling. There were Picasso sketches that I am making up in my head right now, sort of curved cubism in reds and pinks, drawings I'll only ever see in my head. Anyway, I am walking around the Reina Sofia and I bump into Kit, Philip, Miley, and some other guys. I think Abigail was with me originally, but I was surprised to see these guys in Madrid. All of a sudden the Reina Sofia turned into this terrible maze, and there was this psychotic 12-year-old boy with a gun who was chasing us all around. I was now with a group of girls (none of whom were identifiable), and we were all tearing through this maze, which was perched on a mountaintop, so it was very precarious. A lot of the girls were shot. I dove under a table and went limp and tried to pretend I was already dead. Similar to the other dream I had, someone called me out on faking death. I was terrified and sweating, and sand was sticking to my face. I was trying so hard to cry silently and wake myself up at the same time. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't wake myself up. It was like I was literally stuck in this dream. Anyway, the kid who was killing everyone came up behind me and I cringed, waiting for him to shoot me, but then I leapt up and faced him. He looked scared, and I tried to calm him down and talk him out of killing everyone. He said he felt like a monster, and I tried to reassure him that he wasn't and that he was still young and just coming into himself. I somehow got out of that nightmare and found myself in the dining hall at my college waiting in the salad bar line. There was some guy behind me who graduated a few years ago, who I can't name, but I think I remember thinking he was cute. He was standing behind me and flirting with me as I made my salad, which was spinach, tomatoes, pesto, hard-boiled eggs, and chickpeas. When I walked to my table to sit down with my friends, I realized that it was graduation dinner, and I was horrified that I had somehow missed my last semester at my college. I tried in vain to ask someone what we were doing, or how it was May already, but everyone was drunk and crying, which wasn't helpful. Then I woke up. (510 words)

I had a dream that I was back at my high school and someone was painting a portrait of me, so I had to lie on this couch for a long time while I was being drawn. I could see a tiny scorpion walking around on the coffee table adjacent to me and became worried that it would walk up towards me! I was then somewhere with Alondra and was getting married to Channing Tatum. I was confused as to why we were getting married, when Alondra and Andre had been dating for 9 months and weren't even engaged yet. Alondra assured me that this was a good decision. I was wearing a veil and up at the altar. Alondra was behind me, pushing me along. Channing Tatum kissed me, which was fine, but I just didn't understand why I was getting married. Next, he and I were in some really nice boutique. I was picking out different lingerie slips and dresses. I didn't realize they were lingerie until I tried them on and they were completely transparent. I was horrified and ran home, where my dad was purchasing the portrait of me. It wasn't an oil portrait; rather it was some kind of moving lithograph print. My figure comprised of the Benday dots used by Lichtenstein, but I moved within the picture. It was actually one of the coolest things I have "seen." Anyway, then I woke up. (239 words)

I had a dream that Gage was performing oral sex on me, and I'm pretty sure I had an orgasm in real life and it woke me up. (28 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#048 (01/31/2010)

I had a really scary dream that I was studying abroad in some small Italian town. I had a weird Italian cell phone that wouldn't make calls, only receive them. I went into my apartment one day and five strange men I had never seen before had broken in. I started feeling like I was choking on the air and couldn't breathe. I tried to grab a baseball bat nearby but it was stuck to the floor. I started freaking out and ran out of the apartment to some building where Michelle and Gus were. They assured me that everything was ok. I left to go do something but when I returned to their apartment, the five men were there too. I was really scared and found Andy, who drove me away. Then I woke up and fell back asleep and had a new dream. In this dream, I was walking through a giant shadowbox that had all these unknown Picasso figurines he had carved as a boy. I picked one up that was a little bird painted purple and yellow. It was so cute and sort of looked like a more cartoonish version of his neo-classical stuff. I was so amazed that I had never seen any of this before --what a disappointment to wake up and realize it's not real! (222 words)

I had the most vivid dream that I was in the bookstore buying a sketchbook for architecture. The paper was all different sizes and organized into pretty different colored binders. It was also spring weekend, so when I left, there were bands playing outside. Everyone everywhere was drunk and dancing and I became really sad that I was going to graduate soon. Also, I weighed myself in my dream and had gained 8 lbs --weird. (75 words)

I had a dream last night that started out as the absolute worst nightmare I have ever had, but it was a nightmare within my dream, so that when I woke up from the nightmare, I was still in my dream. In my nightmare, I was a mule for carrying drugs across the border to Turkey, Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Israel. There was this horrible, creepy, oily, and disgusting man in his 40s, who was my boss/drug lord/drug dealer. The drugs were some weird form of cocaine and ecstasy in this red and black pill that I hid under my breasts. In order to get across the border, my boss would pretend to be fondling me while he took the drugs out. I was crying the entire time, weeping, sobbing, and doing anything to get out of it. I ran into Kingston once when I was about to leave Kazakhstan to get more drugs. I made the most helpless, pleading face, and he got the point and saved me. He grabbed me and sprinted me across the border, where the guy couldn't bother me anymore. I was so relieved that I started crying and shaking and sweating, and I'm pretty sure that was happening in real life as I woke up from my nightmare into my dream. Next, I had a dream that I was studying Michelangelo's sketches for the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The original for The Creation of Adam was not the iconic image of Adam reaching out to God, but rather a sketchy cartoon of God holding Adam as if he were giving him the Heimlich maneuver. I was confused because I know the real version so well, but apparently this was a sketch that no one had ever seen before and was the real creation scene. (298 words)

I had such a vivid dream about graduation in May. First I think I was in the gym doing sit-ups and Keegan came in. I saw him in the mirror and my heart fluttered. I kept doing sit-ups and all of a sudden I was at the off-campus boys lacrosse team's house with Kit. We were dancing and kissing and it was fun. Then it was senior week (the week of festivities leading up to graduation) and I was running to the library in a blue dress. I think all the seniors had to gather there. I burst through the doors in the library and realized I was drunk. It was a strange feeling, because I think what I had been nervous about before was being late, not drunk. Kit was there wearing a pink and white striped haberdashery shirt and he hugged me and bemoaned the fact that we had never dated at college. He said he wanted to see me next week after we graduated, but I didn't want to for some reason. The inside of the library was constructed in a sort of Frank Lloyd Wright-esque way, in that there were all these steel rafters and open staircase shafts. The building was minimalist and modern and blended in with the environment so perfectly that the ocean waves were swelling up and crashing into the library walls. All of a sudden, I guess the entire setting changed and we were on Pandora, the planet in Avatar. There was a huge wave swelling up about to crash over, and I had to run all the way up to the top of the wave before it crested. I think I did, but then all of a sudden I'm right back in the middle of senior week. Alondra is doing stand-up comedy, but no one is laughing. I am waiting to hear the punch line to this piece she is doing, but I can feel myself waking up. I fight consciousness so hard until I hear the punch line, which was, "The musical, Les Miserables." It makes no sense to me now, but apparently it was hilarious and fitting in the dream. (361 words)

I had another dream it was senior week. This time a lot of the seniors who graduated last year were back. I guess I had decided not to go to "Circus Night," and instead Abigail and I packed up our rooms because we were leaving the next day. The next morning it was pitch black out, but it was definitely morning. Abigail and I waited outside for Lyla to pick us up. She was an hour late and when she showed up, she was wearing a sequined full body suit. She hadn't showered or changed, and this is the first time I can ever recall smelling in a dream. She smelled like beer and a late night out, but it was acute and I could smell it. Lyla explained to us that the reason she was so late was because she had been helping a freshman boy who had gotten lost somewhere. (152 words)

I had the most vivid series of dreams last night. First, I was at Tony's house watching some play or game show of sorts about the history of his family. His brother and sister were there, and I realized he also had another younger sister. The odd thing was that is family seemed a lot like mine --they were really close and played games together and it was very cute. Then I was in a car pulling out of the driveway, and I realized his house was in this steep, mountainous landscape that I have seen in other dreams as well. Then I had a really gross image of having a gigantic pimple on my cheek. I poked it and the white pus/goo just leaked out in a shiny, white, subcutaneous glob. (132 words)
Bea 2: a college student:#055 (02/23/2010)

Last night I had a very vivid series of dreams. First, I was talking to Keegan in what seemed to be his house. He was waiting for baseball practice and I was waiting for some other athletic event in the field house as well. We were just talking and it was fun! Then he said he wanted to introduce me to his mother, but since we had only met this semester, I figured he was just being friendly. Still, I was flattered and excited. But then I think we had to drive to the field house because his practice was starting soon. We drove over there and then that was the end of that. Then I was in my high school dining hall with Alondra and some random freshmen from college. I was trying to explain why this new painting called "Emily Combusted" was so important and innovative. It was on the front page of the New York Time Arts section. I was talking about how it was part of this new movement called "ir-realism," which is a post-modern sort of surrealism, a style of painting that encompassed the subconscious and wanted to investigate its inner workings, but did so in a more politically self-conscious way. The exhibition that was being reviewed in the Times comprised some hundred paintings that were like Dali paintings looked at through a microscope far away. The details were incredible, the anguish on Emily's face so powerful. It was new and fun and exciting seeing this art in the paper. 

Then my father was swimming in the Olympics and got a bronze medal! (268 words)

I had the most vivid dreams last night. I can't remember the order exactly, since they all seemed to be happening at once. First of all, I was going down to a store to interview again. My father was writing out this list of things I should wear and say in my interview, and it was really stressing me out. He told me to bring this special coat from Vienna, and I couldn't see how that would make a difference, but oh well. Then Tony and I were skating and playing hockey in the arena. We were sort of scrimmaging one on one, but we were also hooking up on the ice. It was a sort of violent passionate event. I would try to get the puck away from him in the corner, wedging his body up against the boards as much as I could, and then we would be on the ice, helmets off, going at it (not sex). Later, when I was changing in the locker room, I discovered that my entire right thigh was covered in hair. I was horrified, not understanding how that had happened. It wasn't even just regular leg hair that I could shave off; it was like fur. But it was only on my right thigh. Anyway, next I think I was down in New York for this interview at a store. Eleanor was there teaching a class that I may have had to go audit before my interview. There were 2 other girls who were identical to me who were also interviewing at the store, and I became very discouraged. I didn't know how I was going to make myself stand out. I had my alarm clock with me for some reason instead of my phone. Bryson and Tony started chatting with me through G-chat, but I got nervous I would confuse the two of them in my chats. Then I was in a Hallmark store trying to find an appropriate thank you card for the woman who interviewed me. This part was very vivid twenty minutes ago, but I can't remember much now. I think there were some kids from abroad there, but I can't remember. (365 words)

I had a dream that I was on a bus or train somewhere, can't remember. But I was really nervous I was going to miss my stop; maybe I had missed it the week before when I was making the same commute. Anyway, when I got off the train, I guess I was in the right place. There was some sort of party or gathering. But anyway, Calvin was there and I was supposed to hook up with him. I wanted to too, but there was some sort of understanding between the two of us that we were going to hook up, even though we've never talked before. It was as if we were just going to act on the sexual tension and there didn't have to be any sort of explanation. He was shirtless, but had on his white baseball cap. He was holding a peach colored silk sheet and was waiting for me or something. I think I was sort of confused, but I got back on the train and then I woke up. (176 words)

I had a dream that I was in some Health class or other with Tony and other sophomores. We had to give presentations that day, and I guess I had thought I was presenting much later, because I realized I wasn't prepared. I had to present on Lolita and then relate how that had to do with sexual abuse and rape. I had written some sort of song and had condoms with me to give out to the rest of my class. When my professor called on me, I panicked, but ended up having to present anyway. I think the presentation ended up going pretty well. Tony, as he was leaving, asked me out on a date and suggested taking me out to dinner. Of course I accepted, but then remembered that I was dating Philip. The next day, leading up to the date with Tony, I asked my friends if I should just break up with Philip, rather than cheat on him. I wondered why I was with Philip again since it hadn't worked out the first time. Then I was on a golf course wearing pink shorts and pink ankle socks and little golf shoes. I had on a white tank top and a pink ribbon in my hair, and I was skipping near where Tony was playing golf, flouncing and flirting and showing off. Then I had to drive a golf cart with Martin and one of his friends home. I was baking almond cookies that were not yet done, but I had already taken out of the oven. Martin and his friend kept trying to take them off the cookie sheet, which made me really frustrated. Then my_father came home from wherever he was and we were planning to have dinner at 7:30.

The first part of my dream that I remember took place in an old classroom where I might have had 3rd or 4th grade. Sue and I were there with my college baseball team. The coaches and athletic directors had chosen us as managers of the team, so we were there at their first meeting. The meeting started ordinarily enough; the coach gave some inspirational speech, but then the talk devolved to girls. I distinctly remember Keegan being there and looking absolutely perfect. I whispered something to Sue about him being the captain. Martin and Trenton were there too. All of a sudden, the power went out. Sue and I scrambled out of the room to the parking lot. First we stopped at a cafe outside the classroom and we ordered caramel macchiato. When I turned around, Keegan was there. I lamented that I couldn't remember where I had parked my car and asked him if he would please help me find it. He agreed; I purposely led him in the opposite direction of where I knew my car to be so that we could spend more time together. I must have looked cold because he took off his sport coat and draped it over my shoulders. We went on walking through this rainy forest until we found my car. We had been joking about cars and baseball and clothes, and the conversation seemed so real, the banter, the flirting...I'm amazed it was only a dream. Keegan opened my car door and threw some of his stuff in. I was sad when he started walking away, but then he looked back at me and said, "You're not driving off yet, are you? Come walk with me some more!" Delighted, I followed him down some ravine covered in ferns and we went on chatting and laughing. Next, I was part of some secret organization on campus that was trying to change the housing lottery system. We met in this secret cave off campus that no one could find unless he or she knew about it beforehand. There were about 30 of us and we had these secret files on CDs that we were trying to erase. Drake burst in the door and demanded that we hand over the CDs. I had them in my hand. Everyone yelled at me not to give them to him, but to just throw them in the fire. I looked hesitant, so someone grabbed them from me and threw them in the fire to destroy them. I immediately ran over and yanked them from the flames and gave them to Drake. He looked at me as if he were going to hit me and ran out. Everyone started yelling at me for giving them over. "You don't understand!" I yelled. "You will forgive me, but Drake may not." A few days must have gone by, and I was manicuring the lawn outside my house --literally manicuring it with a nail file. I was upset because Drake hadn't yet called me. I thought I should just give in and call him, but I didn't want to. Just then Mommy was mad at me, but I think Martin didn't know I had given away any secret information. He offered me some of his pasta and I took a bite. Later in my dream I was eating breakfast with Trenton at Pickering. Keegan came to join us and I was so happy! (573 words)

Last night I first dreamed that I had to throw another surprise party for Alondra and bake her a cake and buy her a camera. I really didn't want to since I had already thrown her a surprise party. I was in Wal Mart or something and then I realized that Sydney's birthday was coming up too. I wanted to do something for her so I bought a gluten-free cake too. Then I was at home and I think I had a test or something the next day. I was anxious about something. Drake came into my room and we were fooling around a bit. Then he left for a moment (to get water, maybe?) and I had the most intense orgasm I've ever had in real life or in dreams. It was so powerful and still going when Drake came back. I insisted that we have sex that instant, but then my parents walked in and it was horrible! Drake was mortified, and I was furious. I think my parents just tried to ignore what was happening. Drake was so embarrassed that we would have to have dinner with them later. (192 words)

I had a dreams last night that first I was in some school in Alabama learning to parasail. My teacher was very handsome and I had a crush on him. When the time came to leave, I hoped he would volunteer to help me parasail back to my home state. He didn't, and I was left to figure out how to work the parasail by myself. It was only supposed to take me 4 hours to get home, and I had to get home that night since my interview in New York was the next day. I landed in Tennessee by accident and was trying to figure out how to get back in the air when I started a new dream. I was walking to Pickering from spinning class with Abigail. I saw Keegan on the way but I don't think he saw me. Then Abigail and I were standing outside Pickering talking to someone and Keegan turned back and we definitely made eye contact. He spread his arms as if he wanted me to hug him, but I was too far away. Then I went inside Pickering: Andy, Alvie, and Professor Simms were all there too. I think Alvie was taking the GMATs the next day. Andy and I were walking around and he spilled his food and I think I might have woken myself up laughing. (228 words)

I guess my first dream was that my family and I were back in Mexico. Keegan was there and I was subtly trying to get his attention. There was some sort of art auction happening, so I had my father sell this Dali painting that we had. I knew that Keegan lived on 43rd street in New York, so I tried to get my father to sell the painting to a gallery in midtown so that I would have an excuse to be around there. I think he did, but I can't remember. Then I was tanning on the edge a black infinity pool and Keegan was across the pool. I was trying to pretend I didn't know he was there, but it was pretty obvious that I did. I think I was then sitting next to him and I all of a sudden felt very chagrined, so I must have done something to embarrass myself. All of a sudden, there was some announcement throughout all Puerto Vallarta telling everyone to pack up his or her most prized possessions in a bag because a dangerous con man was coming through all the resorts and taking everyone's stuff. Only now all of a sudden, I didn't have to just zip up my suitcase, but rather we were at home and I had to pick only a few things that were that important to me. I think I threw in my iPhone and laptop, figuring that any burglar would only want those items rather than the more sentimental things. I think my father threw nothing in. When the burglar arrived, we all sat downstairs in the family room while he ransacked our house, picking out things he wanted to take. He took some of my mother's jewelry, my father's laptop, iPod, and wallet. I think at one point my father tried to say no and the burglar pulled out a gun and loaded it. He aimed it at my father and Martin and I both burst into tears, sobbing and screaming. I distinctly remember thinking "I won't have a father in a few minutes." I was crying so hard, but I never heard the gun shot. I realized that the burglar was just using it to instill fear in all of us. I offered to take him up to my room and let him go through all my CDs in order to distract him from my father. We went upstairs and the burglar demanded an Akon CD. I frantically rummaged through everything and never found the Akon CD. The burglar ran back downstairs and started lighting all our photo albums on fire. It was then that I realized that my laptop and iPhone were completely replaceable, but those photos were not. Then I was back in Art History 101 and hadn't studied for my final exam. I think I thought I had, but in reality I had never made flashcards or reviewed for the essays. I went into the exam and opened my blue book. The slides flashed on the screen, and I was only able to identify 4 of the 10. I reassured myself that I could make the points up on the essays, but then I realized I didn't know anything about the objects. To make matters worse, I was writing with a gigantic indelible marker, which was clumsy and awkward to hold. I could only fit a few letters in per page of my blue book. Finally, Professor Durkin came over and asked how I was doing. I told him truthfully that I was doing horrible and had not prepared for some reason and also that I had this horrible marker to write with. He helped me talk out some of the themes in "Hanging Lantern," a performance piece that I completely made up in my head. I wrote out "seeking to but failing to find one's own voice" on my leg in pencil. I guess he had given me a pencil to replace the gigantic marker and rather than ruin another blue book, I decided to write my answers all over my skin. Then I woke up. (689 words)

I had the worst dream last night! So I think I was in some very random location but there was a bookstore on the hillside. Some anonymous friend and I decided to spend the night in the bookstore and read all night and just browse. So when the owner left and locked up, my friend and I just stayed. The bookstore must have been haunted or somehow possessed because that evening was really weird. First we were running through a labyrinth of human body parts. The walls were made of feet and toenails and animal claws, and everything was red and raw and smelly. There were plants made of human skin and body parts, but for some reason I just told my friend to ignore it and that it wasn't a big deal. It started raining at some point, and we took refuge at Bugler House. Some of the guys were there and wanted to party, but we didn't want to, so we went back out into the human body part maze. Then, and I don't know how this happened, but I was being raped somewhere. I think within the bookstore there was a mall or store of sorts and I was trying on clothes and some random man came in and forced me to give him head. I was crying and trying to fight him off, but he was a lot bigger than I was and was forcing himself into my mouth. I was sputtering and choking and trying to scream and it was horrible. As soon as I ran out of the dressing room after being raped in multiple ways, I ran into a street and a bus ran over me. Seriously. I felt the bus try to stop and I crumpled down as the wheels passed over me and the bumper scraped into my chest. I must have been lying on my stomach in real life because I definitely felt a physical pressure on my body and was finding it hard to breathe. I think everyone around me thought I was dead and was trying to figure out how to get rid of my body, but I knew I was still alive and was trying to yell out that I just needed to go to the hospital, but no one could hear me since I was completely winded. My friend and I found ourselves back in the bookstore and realized it was morning. We tried to leave before the owner found us, but as we were leaving, we saw police cars parked outside and knew we had been caught. The owner was striding slowly toward us carrying this long rifle. My friend and I were racing to get out and around the building and hide, but we were moving so slowly for some reason. Neither of us could just get going and it was painful to watch him approaching ever closer. He caught up with us and made us get on our knees as he held the rifle to the backs of our heads. We were crying and pleading with him not to shoot us. I had a distinct thought of "I can't believe I have been raped, hit by a bus, and am going to be killed all in one day." I was sobbing and thinking of my family. Then out of the middle of nowhere, this man and wife saved us. They knew the owner and told him they would take us into custody at their house. I was so relieved and grateful that I said I would do anything to earn my stay at their house and that I was just so elated to have been rescued. Well their house turned out to be a terrible orphanage. They told me my parents had died and wanted me taken care of, so I had to stay with them. They only ate steamed cabbage and pasta with no sauce and lived in the smallest, dirtiest apartment. They had some other orphans with them, plus my friend and me. Part of my keep was to clean the apartment, which was impossible because it was perpetually dirty, and I had to be the sex slave of the man. It could have been a few days later, or a month later, but I heard a knock at the door one morning. The "father/master" opened the door and it was my father! I was so happy I tried to yell out to him, but my owner said I had passed away. I was shouting and trying to draw attention to myself, and my father was so upset. I became so upset and started crying. I couldn't believe that my owner had lied to me about my parents dying, and that I could leave now forever and for some reason I was just physically stuck and couldn't make any noise. It was so horrible and I honestly thought it was the worst combination of things that could ever happen to me. I was so happy to wake up. (837 words)

I was at my parent's house that I grew up in and I was going out with a friend that I have here. I saw the house in fairly clear detail as if I were seeing it, and I went out with my friend to her house which was another large place with a lot of stairs. Again there were a lot of visual details. I could see a lot of colors in the rooms, the colors of the carpeting and the furniture and all the different shapes and different lighting as we moved from room to room, and she and I were talking, I don't remember what about, and I got to the top of a long flight of stairs inside the house and I was looking around and I said to her something like I forgot to close, to lock the front door of my house and that I had better go. And I had forgotten to lock the door of my house, but mostly I just wanted to go home, so we went back down this really long flight of stairs, and I don't remember if I had my brace on, that I wear, or not, just for some reason I was focusing on the stairs a lot. She does in fact have a long flight of stairs leading into her house, but they are outside not inside. (231 words)

I was back in the house that I grew up in and there was a child there who I was supposed to be looking after, who appeared to be 5 or 6 maybe. Who didn't appear to like me very much. Then again, the visuals on the house appeared to be very clear and although I could see the child... not with any clarity, just sort of a vague form, but I can't recall any facial features, I could hear her voice and the inflections of her voice, she didn't come very close to me. I don't remember particularly what I said to her but just remembered feeling very awkward which I guess I do around most children, in any case... at one point I was going out to get our family dog. To get our dog we used to have to go through the kitchen, into the garage, out back to where he was tied up. So I left the child in the house and went out to get the dog, I came back in and the child was sitting at the dining room table, and I could see her there, vaguely, and I could hear her talking to my sister who was sitting with her and they were coloring and I was somewhat relieved that my sister was with her because my sister was always much better with children, but I had also felt somewhat hurt that the child would sit with her and play with her but not with me.

Right before waking up I remember standing in the kitchen of that house and my mother and my grandmother were there, that is my mother and her mother and my mother asked; "what would you like to do, go for a walk or go using your wheel chair?" And I was somewhat anxious about going at all, I really didn't want to leave the house, but I thought to myself that it would be easier to use the wheelchair, but I needed the exercise so "I guess I'll walk" I said to my mom, "I guess I'll walk." And I was looking in the refrigerator while I was waiting for my grandmother to be ready to go, because my grandmother was also going to go on the walk with me. I was looking in it and seeing the different foods, and the light, the way it came on in our fridge when I was younger and I could still see. And people were talking, I don't remember who exactly, but they were discussing a recipe which sounded especially unappealing to me, something about some low fat chicken parts or something and my mom was talking about replacing that with beef and how it didn't work very well.

Last night I dreamed that I went back to school, to college, and I was moving into my dorm room and all my friends were still there, moving into their rooms, there was a lot of noise, a lot of people moving around, it was moving day. My suite-mate L was there, my friend J. I could see the room, the color of the carpeting, just the lighting and all that, the way I had always seen it in my head when I lived there, and I had been asleep and I woke up and this woman, actually two women came into the room, some of my friends were in the room too. And these women were telling me that I had to move all my stuff out, because they had a housing shortage and in the housing lottery I had drawn a place to live, but it was a tent in the parking lot and I was really, really upset because it was going to be winter soon and it was getting to be cold, and besides, I was in the room that I had been in all along and it was nice and I wanted to stay there and I told them: "Look, you better see what you can do because I'm arthritic and I can't live outside, even in a tent, especially in winter I just can't." And they were just basically saying, "well that's just tough luck" and I said "You know I realize that, but I just can't live under those conditions and I'll transfer out of this school but" I said, "in the mean time I'm going to sue you for discrimination if you keep this up and force me to transfer". And they began to get really annoyed and silent and sullen at that point I could see them vaguely, I couldn't see their faces, one was sort of heavy set and shorter and the other was taller and a tiny bit overweight. One was wearing a white cotton sweater, I can't remember what the other was wearing. I also remember something else which might have been part of another dream. (358 words)

There was a book published, like a book of essays and the authors of these particular, essays were going to get together and do a public reading of the book, each author was going to read their one of their essays that were in the book. And I had several essays in the book and I was trying to decide which one to read. Only I was reading it in print, I was, I had to get fairly close to the page, the way I had to when I was younger to see the print, but I was reading the print book. I was trying to select an essay and I was reading bits and pieces of different essays and trying to decide. I was in I guess it was some sort of conference room, I wasn't sure what kind of room it was, it had a sort of very thick, plush, maroon carpet and large tables and really big windows. It was a really huge room. (167 words)

I had a weird sort of dream, I was stuck somewhere, in a doctor's office, like in an exam room, waiting for a long time and then I left. The whole office had a sort of maroon carpeting and looked like it had been a really big house at some point or something and then I walked out of the exam, the whole office, I was wandering around this big long hall and it was carpeted the same way and it had big huge windows lining the whole hall I think on both sides, and it looked kind of late out, not like real sunny and I guess I was there a really long time because a nurse came out from the doctor's office and said that I'd been there a really long time and did I have a ride home, and I suddenly realized that I didn't, that I hadn't made arrangements with the patient transport [company] to go home and that it was after 5 and I couldn't and besides, I needed 24 hours notice. And so I was wandering around the halls of this really big building looking for a phone and I think I remember going back into the doctor's office and calling D, my husband, but he was staying with his brother and his mother and I guess because his van broke or something and that he had gone to bed and I so I was wandering around this building, and all of a sudden I was with somebody. And they kept changing who they were and they changed from my best friend in grade school through high school to my best friend from high school through college, and my best friend now, and they kept switching from one person to the other and we were going all around this building and somehow we ended up in my old church, outside the sanctuary and I started to go down the stairs to the lower hall of the church and I said to my friend "I've got to find a phone, I wish I could find a phone" and the church was lit, like it always was when I could see, but it was late like it looked at night. Then she called me and said "there's a phone right here". And so I went back up the stairs, but I felt kind of scared or anxious about going back, and then I got to the phone and found that I didn't know how to use it, I finally figured out how to use it and began to dial it and I dialed 4-6 and then I realized I was dialing my parent's old phone number and that they didn't live there anymore, and they were really far away and they couldn't help me anymore and I hung up and I started to cry and I said to my friend, "nobody can help me, nobody can help me I don't belong here" and I went down this back hall which used to belong to the nursery school that was held at our church, and I was crawling down the hall and I came up to this room and I was still crawling, and I went in but it was my next door neighbor's play room from when I was little. I was crawling across the play room and I was, there were toys everywhere, like on, all over the floor like there always were there, but I wanted to get up on the couch for some reason, it looked kind of like mid-afternoon in the playroom, I think there was something else, in the playroom, like some other scene which I'm not remembering... Then my friend came back in later and I crawled back over to her and I curled up against her and I was crying "I want to go home, I want to go home" and she wasn't saying anything, but I thought that she was thinking that I was crazy for acting like a little kid.

I was in my parent's old house and it looked somewhat like the basement did, the whole house was really dark and there was some sort of gathering of S people (a social club, a refuge for survivors of abuse). And there were like people everywhere and I was wandering around, listening to different groups talking, and finding out who they were and the basement was sort of dimly lit with a kind of yellow incandescent bulb in the ceiling. And there were people sitting on the stairs I knew, some friends I knew from college. That was really weird, and so I stopped to talk to them for a while and then I went upstairs into this kitchen which wasn't my parents' kitchen. And it was really dark in there with candles and stuff lit and there were these people and one of them I recognized as being a member of S. Guess they probably all were but, I recognized one who goes by the name Shadow Dancer. And he said something about do you want to join us and for some reason I had it in my head that they were witches and I wanted to belong but I didn't want to be part of it even though I didn't think they were doing bad magic. Anyway, I didn't like the idea of witchcraft of any sort and I said "no"... I was supposed to fly home and it was much later than I thought, and I felt really bad because I hadn't called my parents. I was walking everywhere in the house, looking for a phone. (269 words)

I had a dream I was in a mall and I was shopping with my friend X from S [the club] and this guy who was with X but I don't think it was her husband. I was in a wheel chair and so was she and we were going through this store. A section of the store with lots of clothes. It wasn't all a clothes store and it had sort of the usual mall kind of lighting. And it was quiet, not too quiet, like the store was carpeted so it was not too echoey in there. For some reason I decided to walk to the next store, I was walking with my sister and we were in the next store and walking around and I realized that I left my wheel chair in the last store and someone went back to get it and then somehow we ended up, X and I were parked next to the front of the store where it goes into the mall, like this really wide area, we were just parked there in our wheelchairs and this guy who was with X, and so was my sister, said something to X and she said something back like "we'll talk about it later" and she sounded like a little kid. And I said "okay". And the guy said something to us like, "you know, you two used to be so normal until you started hanging out together." And I realized I was sucking on my hand like a little kid and I took my hand out of my mouth and felt really stupid. And X said "You should be glad, at least we survived". (279 words)

I was in my old high school and I was sitting at a table in the hallway, guess no classes were in session. It was just a regular school table, I could see everything, the lockers and the doors, I'm not sure what I was doing at this table. I could see the yellowy track lighting that most schools have and I had a bunch of papers, I'm not sure what I was doing at this table, or doing back in high school, I graduated in '88, but I was back and was supposed to be back in classes, and the bell rang, so I took all my stuff off the table and I called Oval, my guide dog and I realized that I forgot to put her in harness, so she had no harness and no leash, and there was no way she could guide me and I had no idea which class I was supposed to go to next, but I knew that I was really, really behind in all my classes. So I went to the room that I used to go to where I had all of my books and my Braille equipment and stuff so I went to the room with her and closed the door. And it was a real mess in there, there was junk everywhere, like it had been there for a really long time. There were textbooks everywhere, it was dark, there were no lights. So I turned on a radio, and I was looking through some of my books and just feeling completely confused and overwhelmed and I knew that I must have been failing nearly everything. Some guy came into the room and he sat down besides me and he said something to the effect of "we've been discussing you and we think that you ought to go home" and I said "why?" and he said because none of the other students can just retreat to there little room. They don't have a little room like this. Everyone else has to go to the cafeteria and study and everybody is always so sympathetic to you and no one else gets breaks like you do and its unfair to the other students and you should go home". While he was talking to me he put his arms around me like I was a little kid and he apologized for upsetting me. Something about him having issues of his own. The principal came in and he looked at us and then he left. (422 words)

I was with my best friend, X and we were preparing for a 3 day weekend, like Friday, Saturday and Sunday only all I had with me was my backpack and I hadn't packed anything. We went to the kitchen and we chatted for a while and then we went into this huge bedroom. It had several king-sized or queen-sized beds scattered around the room. Lots of big windows, high up. It was really light or white in there. I was really agitated because I'd forgotten my medication, so she called her doctor and I was listening on another phone, and she asked him if he could get her some medication for while I was there and he said to her "I'm really glad you called, X, I'm really concerned about your blood work" and he talked to her about it. I pulled the phone away from my ear and thought that it might be a bad thing to listen or by listening something bad would occur. I went back out to the kitchen which was small and dark and confining. Like it was paneled with some kind of dark wood. And her 2 kids were there, in there 20's and they kept looking at me like I was something really strange and they wouldn't talk to me so I went back to the bedroom, feeling stupid for not packing anything. And suddenly there was my family, having a party in the kitchen, where I was hiding away from. This guy from a soap opera I watch, showed up and he like picked me up and put me on the bed and pinned me down and I wasn't scared, he didn't do it in a hostile way. He sort of pinned me down in a sexual domination kind of thing. I went back out to the kitchen and then the patio and there were some people there I didn't know, and I didn't want to be outside, but I didn't want to be inside by myself either, so I went outside. And no one even knew that I was there. That's it. (352 words)

Last night I dreamed that I was talking to a person who is bringing her cat over today for a visit before she leaves him with me in his new home. The dream was really similar to our last conversation in terms of arranging the time that he was to visit, but then she asked me if I had plenty of toys and I felt disappointed because she had told me previously the cat was a quiet cat and not very playful and I said 'yes I do, but I thought that you said that he's not too playful'.

I had a dream that I was standing in a rehearsal of my community chorus for a concert and we were dancing as we were singing a mellow Carpenters number and I was relieved to find that I was following everyone else's movements and not out of step with them. Our conductor asked a friend of mine, R, a recovering anorexic, to stand up and speak some words about the disorder in the middle of a song, but she never got up and because I didn't hear her speak I thought to myself: "why is she not getting up?" and speaking the way she's supposed to be.

The Mystic River Chorale, which is my community chorus, was rehearsing in a classroom where we usually hold rehearsals on Monday nights and for some reason we began to sing Vivaldi's (Biachishpere?) and as we were singing it I looked through my folder of Braille music sheets and said "wait a minute! Its not in there, why are we singing this again, we just sang it last Christmas , this isn't appropriate for spring" and yet on second thought, I said, "Well, we'll be able to hear Tracy and Jenny sing again during the solos so that'll be good".

I dreamed that my mom and I went to an Easter service of my church and LS drove us. We got there and it was the auditorium of a local high school and we sat down in the upholstered chairs of the auditorium. There was no one there yet and I thought "Why isn't anybody here?". LS went to find out why there wasn't anybody there and when the service would start. So she went off to find some information, and while my mom and I sat there I took out a box of Snackwell's crackers, that were spiced with pepper and we started to eat and I thought "Why are we doing this, these are supposed to go to my dad for Father's Day" and I felt intensely guilty for bingeing on the crackers that were earmarked for a present. And then, as I sat there eating, I heard at the back of the room on someone's boom box, an evangelical broadcast and thought to my self, "why aren't we doing this, we're supposed to be having a service and we're not doing it, here I am listening to the radio and its got this religious broadcast, and we're supposed to be doing this and why aren't we and why aren't there anybody here? Where is LS and why hasn't she come back?" (224 words)

Last night I dreamed that I received a Braille letter from the agency that I was applying for a job with, and it said that I had been refused the job in favor of a guy named George C... I didn't know the name, because he was involved with some local political activity and other things that I knew about. I said "well that's good, he should be more suited for the job than I am" so I was glad that he got the job and not me. I was also really relieved because I really didn't want the job even though I had applied for it. (107 words)

I went shopping with a friend, LV, and I looked in this clothing store, through a rack of summer type sweater-vests, but instead of getting one of those, I ended up buying for myself a wind-breaker textured summer vest and took that home. When I got home, instead of entering through the front door, I entered through the basement door and heard some commotion going on upstairs, some people talking and bustling around and I wondered what was going on. But I turned around, and after setting my vests down went outside because I knew that I had some friends from church waiting to take me to an outing in the afternoon and yet I couldn't resist finding out who was upstairs and why and so I turned back around, went back inside, closed the doors and went upstairs and discovered it was my parents putting up stair treads that they had planned to put up sometime this year and had never gotten to. They were also painting, which I didn't expect them to do. I asked them about it and they said "oh, we're just here, doing a lot of stuff this afternoon" and I said "well that's all right, but I'm not going to be here this afternoon, I'm going back out to a church function" and they said "well that's all right, we don't need you here but can we make tuna fish sandwiches for this afternoon when we break?" And I said, "yeah, you can do that I have plenty left" and I went outside to find my friends still waiting for me and that was it. (271 words)

And she told me to open my gift and I did and there were 2 place mats. I don't know how they fit into that small box but there they were. One end of the place mats was beautifully cross-stitched, they were Irish linen and the cross stitching was green and black, the linen was an unbleached color like a muslin, they were not very pretty but she was so pleased that I told her they were just lovely.

I dreamt that I ran out into the street. I heard a fire engine, a sirens. This huge, bright red fire truck came into view and apparently stopped. It was empty in back, it was just like a dumptruck in back. No hoses, no ladders, no Indian tanks, no equipment at all, but there were 3 or 4 men in the back of it. The cab was immense, it was like the truckers' rigs that you see now, like they're carrying a living room with them. One of the men said, "I bet there are no peanuts on the floor in the front." I don't know what he meant but that's what he said. And the rescue unit went by and when it did, by now I was sitting down, and when it went by it rattled whatever I was sitting on so badly that my head got bumped several times. (151 words)

Dreamt of a flat, good sized box, and again I believe my daughter gave it to me. It was not a gift. It had quite a high priced price tag on it. I opened the box and inside were 6 bars of soap. So pretty, so lovely, and they were interspersed with designs between them. They were not neatly arranged, just random, with no pattern and I wanted so desperately to buy that box of soaps because I love nice soaps and I kept looking at the price tag and I couldn't see the price and I knew they were expensive and so I didn't buy the box of soap. I believe they were blue, a pale blue, and the designs which lay between the niches had roses and other flowers, pink roses and yellow roses and blue flowers and green leaves and just really pretty box of soap.

I was playing an organ at a funeral and I thought it went very well, but apparently someone was very unhappy about it because a man, and I have no idea who the man was, left the funeral home with me and we walked along a very deserted road, and it was bitterly cold. I had on my woolen winter coat which goes below mid-calf and its a very comfortable coat, but its awkward and heavy. And the wind was blowing and it was raining all of a sudden the man with me said "Run P! That car is chasing us!" We began to run, and it was very difficult for me in that coat and I tripped and stumbled, I didn't fall and the man grabbed my arm and pushed me up against a tree. He said, "stand there with your back to the road and he won't be able to see us." And it was very, very dark and the headlights of the car kept coming closer and closer and I woke up terrified and shaking like a leaf. (181 words)

Last night I dreamed that F and his wife L visited me on their way up to [a veteran's hospital] F is going to speak at the BVA meeting (blind veterans association). And he said, "come out into the hall", and here were cases and boxes of paper towels and toilet tissue, a piece of heavy, heavy metal which looked like an old fashioned wringer that would fit on a washing machine, and it had a separate motor on it and for some reason I was just delighted to see that and we were actually out in the hall of this building, the corridor, whatever and he helped me carry in the cases of paper goods, I don't know what L was doing. We came in and she was getting something out of a cupboard. She was wearing a bright red dress, and she has very short, very black hair and very trim, neat little figure and this bright red dress just enhanced her looks and all of a sudden a great big dog came around the corner and F said "oh, I brought my dog" and the dog came up to me and rubbed against me and I said to it "oh I bet you're hungry, I bet you haven't been fed". I had a can of dog food in the refrigerator, opened, with part of it taken out, I have no idea where that came from because I don't have a dog. I can remember saying to them, that I'm really not much of an animal lover, but this is a beautiful dog. I turned around and we chatted and I made plans to go up to the VA hospital, and I asked if we could stop and eat breakfast along the way and the answer was a very solid "No, we won't have time" and I was bitterly disappointed.

I dreamed that I was romantically involved with a young man, comparatively young, middle 30s or 40s. I felt completely attractive and as though I fully deserved the affections of this young man, who's name I do not know. We went many places together and did many things together. He would hold my hand whenever we were walking, and if we were in a room, he would involuntarily hold me in his arms and caress me, my hair, and kiss me but very dispassionately. There were no sexual implications at all. In this particular part of the dream I was getting dressed to go out with him somewhere and he came into the room while I was getting dressed and I said "don't come in, I'm getting dressed" and he came in and said that we were going to go to this house on the outskirts of town, and I said "all right, I'll be ready in just a few minutes" and he left and my son came in and talked to me about something and whatever it was didn't make much sense and he left, and the strange thing was that my son was his age, 39, but I was still the "younger woman". Eventually I got dressed. I had showered and done all the feminine things, the deodorant, the cologne and so forth and met the young man and walked hand in hand for quite a distance, to a beautiful street where there were all theses old sea captains houses, like we have on the coast of Maine. The street was lined with these houses on both sides of the street and we walked by many of them and finally came to one that was more like a southern plantation with the pillars in the front supporting a balcony. And we went around to the side of this house and we entered a door and climbed a flight of stairs and there was a door at the top and he had a key which unlocked the door, and we walked into a room with very high ceiling, no carpet on the floor, but an ugly brown chair, and an ugly blue chair... I don't remember any draperies, and there was a big old television set in one corner, obviously an old, black and white and he led me through a door into another room, which was totally unfurnished, it was quite a maze of rooms actually, all empty of furnishings except that first one. There was pealing paint on the walls which I believe were painted white, but that's not very vivid now, and he left me to go somewhere and a friend of his came in and asked me how I like the apartment and I said that it could be very nice if it was fixed up and a couple, a man and a woman, presumably his wife, and a little boy came in and walked into another room, which I assumed was a bedroom, they were very, very tired, and they put the boy to bed in another small bedroom, and they disappeared and I can't describe them to you, and I stood in a hall and leaned up against a wall, and I was very nicely dressed, I had on black panty hose, and nice black shoes, a dark gray skirt with a black sweater, some earrings and I felt as though I looked very nice. And across from this hallway there was good-sized hole in the wall, 6 or 8 inches in diameter and down the floor came a good sized spider, and I am deathly afraid of spiders, and I just cringed up against this wall and shouted to this friend of my friend to please come and kill this spider and he said "get real, I don't like them, I'm afraid of spiders too". So he didn't come to help me and the spider just came closer on the opposite side and he tried his best to dig his way in under the wall. He couldn't, and he only had 4 legs. And he had an oval, red patch on his back, but when he climbed the wall to get up to this hole, it turned to be gray and fuzzy. And when it looked in this hole and then tilted down, clinging to the rim of this hole with his back legs, and when he lurched up and he had a very small mouse in it's 2 front legs and he tipped the mouse up and opened his mouth and the blood ran out of the mouse's mouth and into his. And I began to gag and retch and thankfully woke up. (782 words)

I think, just standing and talking and all of a sudden he said, "Oh, I get it!" and he looked up and d here was this shelf with 2 hats on it, one was his and one was mine; a red baseball type cap with the Marine emblem on the front, like I bought at the PX of the [veterans hospital]. His was like a felt hat that men wear in the winter but it was made of straw and it was on top of my hat, and apparently this was a very sexual thing to him because he turned to look at me and he said "I know why you did that" and there was a sexual tension in the air and you (the researcher) walked into the room and looked at us and looked at the 2 hats and began to laugh.

I went into a huge building, either an old factory or an old mill. The floor was wooden, uneven planks and I was applying for a job and I stood at a counter, an old styled counter that you would see in and old store and filled out many, many papers, applications, I guess they were and then a middle aged, kind of nondescript man said you have to come upstairs and talk to the personnel manager. So we climbed 5 flights of stairs and this was the very top of the building; a very, dirty and dusty and uneven wooden floors and he led me down a long empty room, and there on a wide, wide windowsill, sat my daughter, writing something with a pen and paper. She was sitting in the sunlight and it was shining on her beautiful blond hair, and she turned with a wide smile and said "hi mom! I've been waiting for you." (159 words)

I dreamt that I was watching TV the way I have to, very, very close to the screen, when along came this huge, black, furry spider and covered the screen. I felt all the hair on my head stand up and then I realized that it was part of the program and so I turned off the set. (58 words)

It entailed me and 2 of the maintenance men that work here in this complex, playing a game of Monopoly. We have a fairly large dining area in this building where I live. Both of these men is named Dick, Dick T and Dick B. and they're both very nice, capable men, in terms of taking care of needs and repairs. We were sitting at one of the tables out in the dining area and the Monopoly board was on the table in front of us with all the little pieces, the ship and the shoe and the whole thing on the board, but we were playing with several decks of cards. Somehow we would score the Monopoly game by the hands of the cards we were dealt. And Dick T and I were doing very well, we would get good hands, but Dick B got 2 zeros in a row, became very angry and said "I ain't playing this game no more and got up and left". (168 words)

I was playing an organ in a big church in a loft high above the congregation. I believe it was a pipe organ, a bit strange because I've never had any training playing pipe organs, yet here a I am at the console, playing an original piece of music that I composed. Very discordant but at the same time very pretty. I was really doing a wonderful job and the minister came up to the organ and I don't remember why he did or what was said but all of a sudden I was down in one of the pews and there were people with dogs just literally running around, all through the sanctuary.

Not too clear, but apparently I was going to fly somewhere or had flown and had a really big, bright green suitcase and it had been stolen , and I was upset because a great many of my valuable personal items were in it. And there was an elderly lady standing by who was very sympathetic and gave me an envelope with a 100 dollar bill inside which I tried to refuse and she wouldn't listen so I took it and as I was leaving her she handed me a 50 dollar bill and rather than argue with her again, I accepted it and her name was Mildred, and I believe her husband was standing beside her and what concerned me the most and... ahh, I was going to fly out, this was at an airport, it was a long concourse, not with a lot of people around, but a few and my biggest concern was that my ID had been stolen and in that case I could not get on the plane.

I dreamt of a young man who used to be a very close friend of my son's, his name is R. And R and my son and my daughter were in an automobile accident, it was my son's fault, unfortunately, this is not the dream, this is real unfortunately, and R's eyes got hurt. In the dream I saw my son and he said that "R and his wife have split up" and I said "oh my. Why?" and he said "She couldn't stand his drooling." And I said, "R drools?" and he said "yeah" and I said "Well can't something be done about it ?" and my daughter jumped in and she said "he's having electrical treatments but they don't seem to help." And I said, "well, that's really too bad". And from there I went into R's mother's bathroom which was just filled with Loreal products, every conceivable product you could think of and I picked each one up and looked at it. They were all in pink bottles, and the bathroom was very lovely, I can't remember details, but these Loreal bottles were very pretty. (188 words)

I was surrounded by boxes and bags of small balls of yarn which I had to sort out and that was a chore I had done many times in my life and one which I enjoy and so that was a nice dream, all different colors, some were in boxes and some were in Shop and Save bags, the local grocery chain... The I jumped from sorting balls of yarn to dress making in my mother's bedroom which had pale green curtains, the bed that she and my father slept in, and all their furniture, but I was trying to use a pattern and cut out a jacket or a blazer for myself and I cut all the pieces out and held them up and where I had folded the fabric, there wasn't enough so that the front of this jacket was very , very short and could not be used. This took place in a house in a very remote part of southern Maine called UF, a town which had a power station where my dad was the superintendent of and in this dream I looked out the bedroom window, which I often did, and I could see the power station and the Saco river behind it, its really a lovely view and it was very real in this dream and there were all kinds of construction workers who were milling around down at the power station which is called Q Dam.

Today is what we call Patriots Day in Maine. I dreamed about my second husband, whose memory I detest and despise. The dream is not clear, even when I first woke up, apparently I was either visiting or living with some women, all women, in the dream I knew who they were but now I don't. I had been somewhere and I came back with 2 or 3 suitcases and we were sitting around a table talking and I was telling them about my trip and suddenly it hit me that I had been back for a day or more and I hadn't called my husband, apparently in this dream we were still married. Someone else called him and in the next sequence was him sitting at a table with a can of beer in front of him and he had been drinking, very obviously from the look on his face, I remember that look very clearly and he was very sweet in the dream, very nice and he understood why I hadn't called him because I was excited about the trip and coming back , and then we were in a bedroom, I think, preparing to go to bed and there were sliding glass doors and they were covered with draperies and I opened the draperies and that's the end of that dream.

I was working for an old friend of mine, named E in her florist shop, which I did in real life. We were having a really good time, laughing and talking and the shop was really lovely, there were many cut flowers in vases and in the cooler there were some lovely flower arrangements. Then E and I went into another room and E's husband came in with a beautiful, big dog, and I had with me a very small dog and there was instantaneous dislike between the 2 dogs and we had to control them. The other one was not a pretty one, not dingy but, it was brown, they were both brown, hers was an Irish Setter I think, and mine was some kind of poodle, I have no desire to own a poodle.

We went upstairs and I put the accordion on and he adjusted the straps and it was a beautiful instrument and it was black and white and it was definitely a man's accordion it was so big. (139 words)

I worked in a very small, mom-and-pop store. The shelves were very well stocked and I waited on several customers and then it became some kind of a night club I guess because there was a line of female exotic dancers led by a male dancer all of them dressed in really fancy skirts and tops, and they came out and began to dance in a single line and it was very acceptable in my dream, it was apparently part of a show that this store put on for customers. But when they turned around and danced with their backs to the audience, the women and the man were all naked to the waste. He was very brawny a lot of hair on his chest, very muscular, I can't remember his face at all if I saw it. The women's breasts were coming out from under their arms, were down at their navel very, very peculiar looking breasts, and from there I was in a long room, looking up at a kind of cage, quite a way above my head, but I could have reached it if I had stretched. It had a glass front and was perhaps 3 feet long and perhaps a foot deep. And there were things inside it which I had to get. On the left side there was a bright yellow something which I had to reach inside and get but curled near it was a huge reptile of some sort. Probably a circumference of 20 inches at least around his middle, very, very frightening and I drew my hand back and when I did, it startled him and he came out of the cage it did not have a grid over it. It fell to the floor and became 2 very, very small hippopotami and they were very small and very menacing, and they began to chase me and I was frightened and finally, the room wasn't that big except there was a flight of stairs facing out of it and I decided to turn and face them and I turned around and gave them both a good kick. And they started to bleed, one from the mouth and one from under his chin and they were very subdued and tried to climb the flight of stairs, but because of their kicking injuries, they were unable.

Last night I dreamed that I was in a group of people, men and women and children and we were on the shore of a very attractive lake which did not look at all familiar to me. Everyone was in the water at times, and somebody brought me a very peculiarly shaped, rubber boat of some type, and I just fir perfectly into it. It was inflated and I could remember my feet just slipped into and made it into a place which was made for someone's feet. The whole thing seemed to be made for my body in a sitting position.

I had the care of a small child, I don't know if the child was mine or someone else's. In the beginning the child, a little girl, was lying on her back, very asleep, and a coverlet laying askew. I carefully placed the coverlet over her, but could not cover her feet, so I pulled it down and her shoulders were uncovered and I pulled it up and her feet were uncovered again. Then she was in a crib a very large crib and she was sitting up, laughing, she was a beautiful child, but I can't remember any details of her face or hair. (105 words)

At one time I worked at a very large wholesale/retail hardware store and one of the men I worked with was named Bud. In the dream I was back working in that store only the whole set up was different and Bud was not a clerk in the store but a customer. He wanted a large bag of some lawn preparation, probably Scott's lime or something and he wanted to know the price so we started looking inside these catalogues and we couldn't find the price and so I told him that I would do some research and check around and try to find the price. The store closed and that was it. I went home I guess. (118 words)

I dreamed about my younger daughter, C. In the dream she was a small child again and I was leaning out an upstairs window of an apartment where we lived apparently, and she was crossing a very busy street and I shouted down to her "C watch what you're doing!" Because she wasn't watching where she was going and the traffic was very heavy and she just said "yeah" and she bent over and picked up a banana peal and once again I shouted "don't pick up other people's garbage!" and she flaunted the banana peal, waved it around.

C and I were going to a beach and we had to walk down quite a steep incline and the path was very narrow, and between very prickly bushes, possibly holly bushes. They grabbed at our clothing and scratched our arms and legs, but it wasn't painful at all. They were very pretty glossy green leaves and red berries and the path was just wide enough for one foot so you had to place one foot directly in front of the other. We finally got down to the beach but there was no beach, there were just big rocks, and she clambered up onto a big rock, and I was just behind her and I looked out and there was a huge wave coming and I screamed "C watch out for the wave!" and she clung to her rock which she was on and which had a point on it, and the water engulfed both of us and through the water I could see her hanging onto the rock and I tried to reach her but I couldn't because the water was so powerful, and when the water subsided, she was gone and I was totally dry and I just shouted at the top of my lungs "Oh God! C come back!". I woke up very, very startled. (218 words)

I was hanging up clothes for my mother and one of the pieces of cloth was one of my dad's tan workshirts. They were long sleeved and he had pants that matched them. The shirt was almost as if it had been very stiffly starched and ironed and I had a real problem hanging it on the line and one of my mothers friends was on the lawn, playing with a dog I don'' remember the size of the dog, but I was surprised that this dignified lady, this school librarian would be roughhousing with a dog and there was a small statue of Queen Victoria on a stand somewhere, and it was very nicely painted, she was not in mourning and that the most common picture you see of her... Here she was short and dumpy but she had on lovely clothes, a blue skirt and pink blouse and that's it. (152 words)

One of the women in the building named M and I were baby sitting this beautiful, little boy 5 or 6 years old, he was just adorable, and for some reason I needed to get some chocolate chips and so M offered to take me to the store in her car which she has done a few times, except that her car was a convertible in my dream and we went for miles and miles and we were so concerned about this little boy that we were supposed to be caring for. And we got the chips and we came back and her car, a bright teal color, as it is in reality, the sky was blue and the sun was shining, and we got back to where the little boy was, and he was just fine and the boy's father was there and he wanted to know where we'd been and why we left the boy un-watched and then went on to another subject and to my relief we didn't have to answer him, and incidentally, this is the third dream I've had lately about baby sitting. The other two just drifted in and out and I had no memory of them. (203 words)

I'm at work, I'm not sure where, but I'm stopping off where a conversation is taking place in. I think the third floor hallway of our wing I think. There were some people, but the only person who was speaking to me at the time was, I think, one of the other counselors named M. And he said, "You know, you don't have to be blind to learn things too" and I said "What did you say?", he repeated it and I said, "I know that." (86 words)

I'm at a client's house, at her kitchen table and a relative of mine, a cousin named J came in and said she was T's wife, so we were talking and she said that she had lost some of her sight, we were talking and she seemed very sad and needing of someone to talk to, but at the same time I was very happy to see her, because I haven't seen her in a long, long time and I like seeing cousins that I haven't seen in a long, long time and we chatted on and I think there was sunlight coming in from the window, near the table where I was sitting because it felt like it was afternoon, about 2 in the afternoon. Then the dream jumps to my old house that I grew up in and J was there too and my parents and my sister and I and my friend N. N was my first roommate when I got my apartment and N had a long antennae from a radio and we're getting stations, faraway stations, but when you walk past you have to make sure you don't walk into the antennae. So she's getting a faraway station and she's wanting me to listen to it, but I wanted to go to bed, but she persuaded me to listen to this funny show, there was a song on the radio and I was listening to it and they had different beat in music to it, so we were laughing about the song. And when I decided that we would go into the living room, J was there and she was going to watch TV with my parents, M and my sister, but I was torn between watching TV with them or because I was tired, going to bed. So I said "goodnight" and they all sat down on different couches and chairs and I saw that they were all settled in and I gave it a little bit of thought and, this is about 9:30 at night, I remember seeing the light was on in the living room and I remember the TV was on, I could hear the TV, I could hear them all taking their positions and after a bit more thought I said that I was going to bed because I was tired and I went back to my old room, where I used to sleep and I saw J's pajamas and I moved them, put them somewhere else, I don't remember where. Then I took my guide dog in my room, and for a minute I couldn't remember if I had taken her out at 9:00. Then I remembered that they were doing some kind of construction work in the back yard and I was wondering if it was okay to go out there and I could hear bulldozers and stuff. Then I remembered that I had taken her out but I also thought that if I hadn't I would have taken her out in the front yard. The back wasn't such a good idea because they were doing some kind of digging. I patted her and felt her soft fur and said goodnight to her and lay down and went to bed. (542 words)

The next snippet dream is I was in the apartment, I think I had when I was in Springfield and it seems to be that I'm in my living room and I could see the sunlight coming in the window and I was listening to a tape on the tape recorder and my friend G was taping to me and she said that she wants me to copy her tape. I didn't have a duplicator and so it was really funny, I had to take 2 tape recorders, my little one and a larger one and I had them laid out on the floor, on the rug, in the living room of my apartment that I used to have way back in 1983. I was taping the tape and although I thought it was silly, I felt intimidated and thought that I had better do what she tells me and then the dream jumps to work, and suddenly the 2 tape recorders are there and the tapes are being made and I don't want the boss to see it, and he starts to express some kind of disagreement about something one of the counselors was doing and how they had to be away from the offices and how they had to drive away from the buildings and I go in the office and I'm doing my tapes and copying the tapes and I want him to think that its part of work, and then I'm trying to do some other work too. I wasn't sure what else I was doing, using some machine or something, but I had this idea that I had to keep busy and so I was sitting at the desk between the 2 tape recorders and trying to do another task with it so I could keep working.

I was walking out of some hospital because I had to have some kind of short, out patient procedure and there was a door that I was able to walk through, and I felt really good, but then it was like adjacent to my own office building and so I ended up having to be at work, about a 30 second walk from work, like in a different direction was work, in a different building. I walked into the work area and asked if someone could give me a ride because I didn't think that it was all right for me to walk home even though I felt pretty good, I didn't think that it was a good idea and they said, a lady, I think it was one of my drivers, she said "well we don't know if we can do that, we have to get approval first from somebody else". The dream seemed to end there. (158 words)

We are in my parents' car, I am sitting in the back seat, I could feel that it was morning and we had to go to 2 weddings in New York, one on a Wednesday and another one on a Saturday. And I knew that my father didn't want to go and I said, "yeah I know, but at least they're both together and at least if we're going to one we might as well go to the other one as well. When we got there, we had to climb up a lot of flights of stairs because my aunt lived in the building but we had to climb up to the fifth floor, it was the same house that we visited a long, long time ago. I could feel the stairs under my feet, the so I knew we were climbing up the same stairs. I don't know how, but somehow I had also arrived in a cab too inside my parents were not there but I do not remember the weddings, somehow it jumped and we were at my parents' house having a big party and there were people there and they were all eating different things, and my brother in law was there too and we were all talking animatedly and I can remembered eating grinders. My brother in law had to leave in the middle and I could hear him going up the stairs to his house to the second floor and I was entertaining a lot of the people when he left. And then some other person came in, a relative of one of the people at the party, and we were all having a big dinner and talking and enjoying it, we were all happy and I can't remember some of the conversations but we were all talking, and I can't remember what time of day it was, exactly.

I am at Redwood and there's a swimming pool but it looks really strange, there's a part that's really shallow which you have to get into first before you can get into the real part, so I hadn't gotten into the real part yet but had only gotten into the shallow part before I woke up, and I could sense that the shallow part was a different shape, and there were some people sitting around in the shallow part and they told me that I would have to go by them to get to the deep part and the re were like two different sections and you had to climb over this funny section before you could get to the real swimming part. And then we were at the Redwood school where I went when I was really little for that pool part of the dream and then we were in my house and people had come to my house and there were kids and they went into my pocket book and they moved all my stuff around and I was trying to figure out what they had done, and they took my signature guide and they took the top off of it so that I couldn't use it anymore and I wasn't very happy about that and I told them that. I noticed that on the signature guide the top was missing one corner so that it didn't go straight across and it wasn't a rectangle anymore, and I was trying to figure out what they were doing and why they were messing up all of my stuff. In the middle of it, one of my client's case records were on my bed too, all my Braille notes to them, not the print ones and I was looking at them and reading them and going through them and figuring out what was going on with that.

My tape recorder had run out of batteries which was kind of a surprise, I was using my little one, I was holding it in my hand and I was pushing the play button to check it and I could tell by the pitch that the batteries were going, so I went into my bedroom, opened up my top drawer to get the batteries out and when I felt around for the 2 little double-As, next to them was a little tiny cup about an inch high and it had a handle on it and I said "no, that's not a battery". I left the cup in there, and put the new batteries in and was surprised that the old batteries had run out since I hadn't been listening to the recorder that long a time. (136 words)

It's Christmas and I'm talking to someone about what I'm giving people for Christmas, but I can't remember what I'm giving everyone, I can remember some and I name them and the gifts that I'm giving them but I can't remember what I'm giving everyone else. I was giving out some ceramic mugs to my aunt F and others that I can't remember. And then we were at a school and an atheist friend that I have was going to be reading the Christmas story and so we were all supposed to go down to listen to him, they made the announcement over some kind of PA system, that we should go down and listen to him, but I thought that doesn't seem right because he doesn't believe in God and in Christians and I didn't want to go because it would be kind of hypocritical to be there unless he's changed and I thought its kind of weird and so I stayed in another room, I don't know exactly what was in there, there was a wooden floor, there was no carpeting where I was. I had a Braille copy of the Christmas story, just a few pages like they were torn out of a magazine. It looked like computer paper and it was all folded up and I was trying to find how it was arranged so I could find the top. I was riffling through the pages with my hand trying to figure out how it was arranged so that I could find the beginning. Then we were in a car, looking for something to eat, my driver B (male) was driving us and we were hungry and we stopped in this restaurant and there were people waiting on us that were [unclear] and these girls were waiting on us but they weren't happy doing it or they didn't know what they were doing and there was confusion. There were wooden tables that we were sitting at and we never really ate though because the girl that was waiting on us was doing different things and so I don't remember eating even though we were in there. We were sitting in the middle of this restaurant. (368 words)

Instead of crossing where I usually do I get to a different corner where on my right, there's a big, metal container of some kind. Its tall and it makes it hard for me to hear the traffic because its tall and is blocking the sound. But somehow there's a way that I can talk to a police person who is up there working, I'm not sure how, I had a radio or something, And I could hear the police person at work talking about this situation so we talked each other through it and then the police person is there at work, putting in paper work for different things that have to be done. Then we went to another building where the new work shop is going to be and it was kind of set up in different ways, where we had to go through all these doors where everyone is standing around talking, there are a whole lot of people there.

We were at work but it was really more of a class than a work and a whole bunch of us are in class with a teacher and we decided that we're not going to stay. A couple of us anyway, decide that we're going to leave early and just take off so it was about 1:30 in the afternoon, I kept looking at my watch, my Bell watch. And somehow we all ended up going to a party and there was a whole lot of us there, many of the people were also members of the Idaho Counsel of the Blind, which I am a member of and we were eating. We all had these bags of food and I was reaching in and grasping with my fingers, little mandarin orange sections and eating them and they tasted really nice and juicy and there was a candy bar but the candy bar felt different it had like a cut out rectangle on one side and it was flat like a regular candy bar on the other side and the rectangle felt like the whole shape of the whole candy bar, like a border on one side, raised up about a quarter of an inch. And you could feel the recess of the rectangle on one side and I said "oh, I've never had one of these before" and I ate it and it was good. We were all eating and I was eating a lot more than I had wanted to and I remember thinking, 'gee I shouldn't be eating all of this its too much' but I kept on eating anyway. We were celebrating S's birthday, he's the head of a magazine I get on tape, and I got to meet him once at a convention, and he wasn't at the party, which didn't matter, we were still celebrating his birthday anyway. The A was talking to one of the other people at the party and telling her that she really didn't want to do something that this other person wanted her to do, and that was unusual I thought, because A doesn't usually complain. About stuff. And I thought, that's good, because if she really doesn't want to do it then she shouldn't do it just because the person who's asking is blind and she's sighted. (389 words)

One of my clients has fathered a child and the mother just had the baby. The baby is a few days old. The client wants to see the child so my driver and I pick him up and bring him over to where the baby is. He has to sign some papers. This has somehow happened again and so has happened 2 years in a row. He fathers a child, needs to be picked up and has to sign papers to be recognized as the child's father. In order for me to continue, now that my driver is somehow gone, and he needs to go home, we took a bus. (110 words)

There are people present in my house, some that I know and some that I don't. But I decide that I want to take a nap and its about 3:00 in the afternoon. So I go upstairs to my bed and I sleep. When I wake up things are all mixed up. I look at my watch, it says ten minutes to seven, and I think about the people and I think I better get up and go downstairs. I again look at my Braille watch and there's a third hand in it and the third hand makes it read like its 4:00, but then this other hand makes it look like ten to seven and so I'm not sure if its ten of seven or 4:00 and I said, "I don't remember there being a second hand on my watch". I went down stairs and I asked if anybody was going to cook anything and nobody wanted to do anything and my sister was there and she said "well I don't know", but I was hungry and I was wondering if we should call out and get some food delivered, but I was also thinking of cooking, but I couldn't decide what to do so I said "I'm going to bed". So I went to bed and I was trying to sleep and I was trying to wake up and I was so tired. When I touched my dog, there was like a pocket on her, a shallow slide pocket where you would hide something very thin in, it was made of fur, but when I put my hand in it it didn't seem to bother her and I thought this was pretty strange to see this on my dog, it didn't seem like an injury to her and I couldn't figure that out. My pillow was all drooley when I woke up. (314 words)

We were traveling to NY and we were getting off of a plane and instead of being that usual flat thing, we had to go down this funny metal thing and it was like a metal, inclined plane and it was very narrow from left to right, somehow I reached down to touch it and it was like a slide for emergency exits but it wasn't an emergency and when I touched it with my right hand, when I stooped down, to clamber kind of, forward, off of it there were like little grooves in it. I knew there wasn't going to be enough room on it for Betty, my guide dog, so she had to follow behind me, but she did. Then we were getting to our hotel, and my suitcase was really heavy and someone helped me carry it and then I had this broken tooth, one of my molars, I could feel it with my tongue, my tooth was like all coming off of the bottom of my gum, I could pick it up and it was only attached on one end, but it wasn't hurting or anything. Then there was this console in front of us with 4 switches on it. You turn them to the right and you can hear people talking about different things. They were all talking about businesses and you had to decide whether their business was solvable or soluble or worth getting involved in. And I said to one of them, "no that's just not going to work", it was somehow connected with the Idaho Counsel of the Blind. There were people there from other states and they were talking about their businesses and we said, "no that's not going to work". Each switch represented one person's business and we listened to the one on the left and then the next one and then the next and somehow my father was there and we were eating and the rest is too vague.

There are two clients I am working with, a lady whose name starts with a J and a man whose name starts with a Q. J is about 16 and in high school and Q is 17 because he's almost graduating and its almost the 30th of September . A place called me and they wanted me to fill out a form for Q, one that I'd never heard of before, so I was trying to find a copy so that I could figure out what they wanted on it I had to decide whether J should attend [famous blind school] or public school next year. It was up to me and my supervisor said if there was only one service that the person needed then J could stay in her home, but I was trying to figure out stuff like whether she could see the blackboard and so I said that I would have to talk to her and find out what she wants to do. So I was working in my dream and I said "oh, well, I better get this form done for Q by September 30th because they have to have it by the end of the fiscal year". Then I looked in vain, and said to person who was with me and said that we weren't supposed to be this far, that we had to go back to New Hampshire, we don't have the proper travel authorization to be up here, if we're caught we will be in trouble. At first we were laughing about it and then we decided that we better go back to where we're supposed to be. That was evening when we were in Maine and we had to get back to New Hampshire.

We are riding in a car one of the rehab teachers is in the front seat and I am in the back seat we got into conversation and she told me that she spends her summers in West Hampton and I told her that I spent years of summers in West Hampton. We got to talking and we were going to where she stays. I told her where I was and she said that she was 2 to 3, miles away from there and I was really excited to get back to West Hampton again, I hadn't been there in a long time. We got there but then we ended up going to a church, and one of these lady's that I know, A was at the church and was preying. I took a rosary out, or had it in my fingers and was praying, but then mass was going to start and so I couldn't finish saying it. When I came out of the church, I had to try and find the driver of the car that had brought us and I didn't know if she had seen me, and I had to walk around the parking lot for a while before she saw me and she called out to me. I then got into her car. Then I was in my apartment in Eastfield somehow, and there were people there, this lady named N who used to room with me when I was in my very first apartment in the 70s in Massachusetts, and I had to get up and make breakfast for her yet somehow there were stairs in the apartment and I had to go down the stairs and I didn't want to wake her up and I was going to try and make breakfast for myself first. There was a door at the bottom of the stairs which I had to try and close, so she wouldn't hear me. But then I found out that she was down there already so I couldn't surprise her with making breakfast. (343 words)

Visiting a friend in the hospital, F, who had hurt himself, gotten into some kind of accident, he had hurt his shoulder, and was spending a couple of days in the hospital. I went to see him and he was doing okay, so it wasn't too sad and he was making good progress and he wasn't really sick and he was going to be coming home soon and he seemed not to be in too much discomfort so I wasn't really upset about it and I thought he was getting good care and we were just talking together for a few minutes.

I was in a building working as a counselor. It seemed to be a very brightly lit office. A student came in who had a problem with drugs and I handed him his folder, it was the same kind of folder that we use for our vocational rehab cases and I remember picking it up with my right hand and I opened it and the client looked at it and somehow there were dog biscuits in it, I don't understand that, or maybe there were like edible biscuits for people, mixed up with the case so I really didn't understand it and the principal of the school where we were said that the student, the client could just read his folder and put it back and he would be all better, so I said okay and we let the student be his own counselor and somehow he looked at his folder and said "okay, I'll be all right now".

This dream involved guide dog school. Somehow I was at my parents' old house and we were sitting on the front porch and a lady came up and asked how did I get home every day, at what time did I get off the bus, then I said that I don't take the bus, once in a while I take the bus, but most of the time I don't take the bus, at first I couldn't remember how I got home and then I remembered that I took a taxi home, but somehow I couldn't figure out how I did that because somehow I was stuck at Redwood school, where I attended when I was a kid and it didn't seem to have anything to do with working. I knew that I usually walked to work like I do now and so I was all mixed up trying to answer her question, it seemed like an unusually difficult question, very confused. Then I was at guide dog school and there were all these people who it seemed were waiting to be evaluated for guide dogs. There must have bee 45 students all standing around asking questions and nobody was assisting them, and I wasn't there to get a guide dog, but I remember thinking, gee, what a disorganized school, to have these people standing around asking questions and not being seated in a room, being talked to about what to expect and what its going to be like. And then we were in this other place and it was really early in the morning and we had eaten breakfast and I was walking around and there was a lot of grass and a lot of opened space, and for some unknown reason, I had to get up early and I said that I was going to walk around down here, its so nice, it was a countryish setting and I was going to walk around.

I am in a college dorm room, I think it was my old room at [City] College and B was rooming with me and we had pizza in our room and I said "there's no anchovies on this pizza" and we wanted anchovies on it. And I was in bed and she had an anchovy all wrapped up in paper and she handed it to me and I unwrapped it and I was surprised that she had brought one and I said "well how did you know that we were going to have pizza in the first place?". I don't know what she said and we were laughing about it and I asked her if she wanted the anchovy and she said "no" I could have it. So I ate it. At some point I opened my suitcase and got my transistor radio out and turned it on, I was trying to find a religious show but I found Dr. Dean Edell and I was listening to him. There was a whistle in the radio, it wasn't coming in so good, and I remember that my suitcase was really light. In reality my suitcases are very heavy usually. It was the larger kind, not the little tiny ones that you usually get on pizza, so I tasted the anchovy then there was a man there, who I think was a psychologist, but he seemed very old, like around 85 and his wife was there, and somehow his suitcase or briefcase was locked and he couldn't get it open and he had important things in there that he had to get, that he had papers that showed him how to open it, a combination perhaps, but he couldn't remember where he had put them and so he couldn't get it open and I was trying to help and I said "try not to think about it and maybe you'll remember, if you try not to think about it, sometimes you'll remember things about where you put things". That was the end except that his wife was really upset that he couldn't get the suitcase or briefcase opened. I didn't know what it was because I didn't touch it. That was in the same dorm, he was in a different room of the same dorm. (382 words)

I was on the telephone with a person named T who is a supermarket guy who takes the orders for me when I call up to put my order in for the week, because they deliver and he was playing an organ and he wanted me to play mine so he could hear mine and I said "wait a minute" and I went over to the organ that I have at home and I was doing the different stops that it has with my left hand, and I couldn't get it to sound the way I had hoped it would , I was going for a particular vibrato and it wasn't going to that sound and I was getting frustrated because I couldn't get it to go to that certain sound quality that I was going for.

I was over at our [blind] industries department and they were making these beautiful sweaters and I touched this beautiful, woolen, knit sweater, which was very well done and I asked what color it was and somebody said that it was yellow and our clients could make them and I said, "let me bring down the products, I have a lady in the hospital now, it might give her some ideas and might make her feel better even though she's sick, to know that she can do this project" and they said "okay" so after calling her I went down and showed her this project, she wasn't mad or anything and she didn't sound sick, not very sick. So I asked my lady driver if she would bring me down, it was about 1:30 in the afternoon to Naugatuck where the client was and she did, but when we got there we didn't go to the client's room, we went to this other place. There were all these children, handicapped, in wheelchairs and we had all these little animals and they said put the animals up on the wheelchairs, but not where the food is, put them up by the kids' heads, more like on the back of the wheelchair. They were little fake animals about an inch long and they sort of stayed on the backs of the wheel chairs and we were having a party with them and eating with them, in this big, well-lit room and I think it was afternoon.

I was in church, at mass and suddenly the father stopped the mass and said "that's all I'm going to do, I'm not going to do anymore mass, I'm leaving" and he did and we all got really mad, all of us in the church and we started to say "he can't do this! We have to have mass. What would happen if all the priests did that? We'd have no more mass! It would be awful." My friend B and her mother and I were walking out and I said "you know, that's terrible, I think he just did that because he's got somewhere to go on his schedule and he just wanted to get out and do it" and B's mother said; "he's right there. He just heard everything you said" and I said "I don't care! I'm glad he heard me and I'd say it again if he wanted me to because its not fair that he did that to us." And I was real mad and didn't know what to do. We kept walking and went home and I was at the church that was across the street from the house where my parents lived when I was growing up, so we went to their house. (210 words)

Its night time and I'm in NY at somebody's apartment, I was lying in bed, I had Betty next to me lying on the floor and we were watching television, listening to it anyway, it was about midnight, but then it was my aunt M and she said "lets go see H" who's my cousin, "its close enough to walk, we don't have to get in the car" but my sister didn't want me to bring Betty, and there were some kids staying there and they were sleeping and I said "no I'm bringing Betty because she'll bark whenever she's away from me and she'll keep the neighbors awake" and so I took Betty with us and the only thing we had to do to get to this cousin of mine was to go out a door, turn right, go down this other driveway thing and then there was another turn and we ended up at his house and I go "well that's not far". So then we stayed there for a while and went right back home again, back to the other lady's house and we just talked. I don't remember much about the conversation. It was nice to see them, they were happy to be together. (208 words)

I'm in this thing called the Runway at Redwood, its between the dining room door and another door to the main part of the building where the classrooms were. And there are lockers and they're made out of wood and another door which leads outside. In the middle of the runway were these great big, structures made of a like Tinker Toy material almost four feet high. You could take your hand and grasp these pegs, these things and take them apart. And they said, "and you guys gotta help out because we only have 10 minutes to get this runway clear because there's going to be a lot of people coming through here, we've got to get these things taken apart." I pulled on one and it came apart pretty easily. So first I was at one end of these things trying to help out, and there were a lot of others helping too, some ladies that are head consultants that work with us. And to my surprise, I pulled on the Tinker Toy-like peg and it came out of the 2 ends it was connected on, and it came off the structure pretty easily, but I didn't have anything to put them in, so I had about 4 or 5 of them in my hands and I was trying to figure out where to put them. I started out at one end, couldn't figure out where to put them and then I went to the other end, see how long it is, how much progress people are making with this thing. It was pretty good, it was going pretty fast but the project never really ended because I woke up. (282 words)

A lady that I work with gave me a ride home. When we left work there was a very light, fluffy snow falling. I could feel it as I walked on it. It was about 4:15, the time we get out of work and she said "oh, I'll give you a ride home" and so I said "Okay", and when we got home, it was a Monday. My niece was there when I got home and she said "oh I didn't go to work today, but I'll go tomorrow" and I was thinking it wasn't fair that she got the day off and I didn't. Then I went to do laundry and somehow somebody had been using the washing machine, but they had it on hold. And I had to figure it out. I don't know how they had set it up, it was kind of mixed up, but we went over there and fixed it up. (157 words)

We're in some kind of room in the West Haven industries division of BESB talking about the cigarette assembly project and how they had to make 3 cigarettes per minute and they were showing us all these cigarettes and how they go together and stuff. It was all smoky, I could smell the smoke, I hate smoke and I was really conflicted because I didn't think it was ethical to put people in this kind of job because it meant that they would have to be around this kind of smoke. But this lady was doing her job and she liked it, and she was able to meet that production rate that they wanted. (114 words)

I am at work, walking around the halls without my dog, I don't have a dog and it doesn't seem to bother me, and I am walking around without a cane. I'm walking around without getting hurt or bumping into anything. My boss is there and he's saying that we have to treat a certain person well at work because he is going in for an operation and they don't know what's going to happen to him. I'm thinking, "yeah, he ought to be telling people to be nice to everybody all the time anyway and not just when they're having medical problems." I was wondering if I was going to run into him before he went to the hospital and people had said that he was at work and I said "he's too sick to be here. He shouldn't be here." Its later and somehow I'm upstairs of my house and a whole bunch of strange, bad people come in but they're barking like dogs, they're making these noises like barking dogs make and that sound like Bob Steele used to play with, the barking dogs which were supposed to represent some kind of hunt. My mother was there and she said that I had to get rid of this cough drop because the bad people put something bad on it that would hurt me. Then I remember my mother how my mother had cancer in real life and how she wouldn't and couldn't get better, even if she got rid of the cough drop, it wouldn't matter. (259 words)

We were in the kitchen of my parents' house it was about 2PM and I was sitting at the table and a CRIS volunteer was there and she was printing out in Braille. She had always wanted to help but she was concerned and asked if it was coming out readable and I said "yes." I was reading it with my fingers and it was okay, there were some reversals but I could still figure it out so I didn't tell her that I couldn't figure it out, she had reversed a lot of Es and Is but I didn't say anything. She said "can you read the second line?" and I said "yes I could." (116 words)

We were taking a tour of a huge school where many of the people there had problems with alcohol, drugs and other problems. People lived there too. This female high school kid was giving me a tour. She was on my right. I don't think I had my dog. I was going inside with her and so I had my right hand on her left arm. We were walking around the school and she was explaining things, we had to stop every now and again and listen to this boring speaker explain things. Then she said "Oh, remind me that I have to go to my room before we leave" so I said "okay" and I did and she went and did what she had to. She thanked me for reminding her. It was a very large building, and walking around was tiring because it was so spacious. (148 words)

I had left on a Monday and I was taking four days and I couldn't take a fifth day without a note from a doctor because I was claiming sick time. It was just a cold and I really don't think I needed to go to a doctor so I better3 go back to work on Friday. I don't know what happened, but I never did go. I remember just being at these people's house and watching TV and listening to the radio and kind of enjoying things because I wasn't that sick, I just had a little cold. (124 words)

I was staying in a suburb of Chicago with people who had some children we were there for about a week and we had to do a lot of riding, because it seemed that whenever they went anywhere, shopping, we would have to drive these very long distances and I remember thinking "gosh, I'd hate to have to do all this driving. I'm glad I don't have to drive this far all the time. The children were writing a poem and each one put in a stanza and the first child's poem was like ordinary and concrete and trite and I thought "well this wont develop into anything" and then the second child's stanza was kind of the same and yet they kept adding to it and finally everybody kept adding verses and as they did it became more and more the way real literature would be and it got really meaningful; and I thought "wow! When it first started out I hadn't expected it to become such a beautiful poem, I want to put it in Braille" and they said "okay we'll write it down." (186 words)

I was at work and I have a ball that looks like Betty's Lacrosse ball and I have a whole lot of string and for some reason, it was like a game and we were walking along from the third floor down to the basement but I was making this string, this ball of yarn, that I had on my fingers, unroll as I walked down and I wanted to see how far it went and then I was going to try to roll it back up, but in the middle somehow, I lost the ball, I lost the end of the string and I thought, "I wont be able to play, everybody else is playing and they had their own, but then B, my driver, came and he said "oh no, here's your ball and here's the end of your string and you can start back up again and real it back up like, you have to follow it back up."

It was afternoon and we were at work ands I was in an office talking to a couple of teachers. One rehab teacher who doesn't always see things the way I do, someone who is not as understanding as I wish she could be sometimes with our clients. I am always frustrated with her because of this. I was frustrated in the dream as well. They were in their office, all talking and not really working very hard and others were there too. Her assistant came in and said "I'm going to watch TV." She had a TV on near her desk. I was standing in the doorway, about 2PM and she went over to her desk on the opposite side of the wall. The teacher I was trying to talk to was nearer to me. I thought it would probably be a good idea for me to leave the room because I didn't want to get caught watching TV or even being a room with a TV even though I wasn't going to be listening to it or watching it so I didn't stay very long.

I'm wearing a very pretty silk dress and I have my period, but I have protection so I am not worried about doing anything to the dress. But I always get concerned about when I have dreamt like this, because in my dream I know that I don't get it anymore because I had a hysterectomy in real life. So I always have a conflict feeling in my dream when I have it in my dream. Later I am reading a book of Braille pages, 19 to 34. It was about this girl who happened to be one of my old clients and that she was riding horses and she was doing all these sporty things, like playing football and she was totally blind and I couldn't figure out how she could do all that. Then I thought, well the article is wrong or something's strange about this magazine. In the same dream I am at this house with a great big living room, but somehow its my house and its after 4PM and you walk out of this carpetted area to a screened in porch and its really nice. The carpeting is new but there are these big square pieces of lint which are somehow there because it is new and I had to get rid of them because I was scared that my dog would try to eat them but I didn't think the vacuum cleaner was picking them up, because I had bent down and felt a couple and touched them.

I was in bed at my parents' house and I had a cup of coffee and even some eggs and stuff I was eating. Everything was going okay and then a cat came up and he was walking around on the bed and I said "no, no, you can't have my coffee" I better get up, because this was no good. I had already had some coffee but there was still some in there and I walked into my parent's' kitchen and had breakfast with them which was nice, and I was having a good breakfast with them.

I just remembered it was night time and I was in their backyard which you have to follow around on a sidewalk which runs from their backyard to the end. I was carrying a shopping bag full of garbage to put in the garbage barrel which was way up at the top, the end of the sidewalk, and I was walking up the sidewalk independently, I didn't need to use a dog or a cane or anything. I was bringing the garbage and yet somehow I had to go back to the house to get another bag, or put it in a plastic bag, so I was going the other way first, then I went back the other way towards the barrel.

My boss was in my dream and he was saying that the first time he got married it wasn't done right and he didn't want people to have the wrong idea, in case, in the future so he was going to have a religious ceremony this time and make it better. He was talking to someone else in the room, I didn't get into it I was more of a spectator hearing him talk. We were in this brightly lit room. It was either a hotel or a conference place but we were in this really big room. It might have been the same part of the dream as the typewriter part. I think it was the same dream where we were typing. (123 words)

I am at the Guiding Dogs, where people get dogs, and I don't need a dog, but I see people I know there who are there to get dogs. But things have changed and many are not out there walking, they're not on a training trip, they're sitting around making calls, talking to their social workers and counselors and doing weird things and I am saying: "you know, things aren't the same here, you should be out with your dog learning, you can't get to know your dog by sitting in a room, you should be out there practicing, that's the only way you're going to learn, by doing it. Why have you changed your training style because its not going to be as effective?" I was very disappointed. (129 words)

There was a funny connection on my computer, there was this funny big wire and there was another little wire which connected with it and it didn't feel right and Curt the vendor guy said, "we can't have it like that." I was kind of relieved to have him say that it wasn't safe like that and that he was going to fix it. And the kids were getting a kick out of the talking computer. (190 words)

We were in a house, I don't know whose it was, my sister was getting some ice-cream together and strawberries, but instead of putting them together we had them separately. There were strawberries in a dish and instead of using a spoon, I had picked up the dish and was drinking the strawberries out of the dish and I was going to get to the ice cream later after the strawberries. I could feel the little bowls that they were in and just before I began to eat the strawberries, I put an object, it was a soft, stuffed animal type thing but it was a person, made of this canvasy type material representing Saint Paul. So somehow I had to put this thing, like a stuffed animal, next to me and someone said "that's Saint John" and I said "No that's Saint Paul" . It had a great big base so I knew it wasn't going to fall over or get into my ice cream or strawberries. (168 words)

I remember getting on a bus and this lady named Jan was our bus driver and I thought we were going a short distance and although we got on in Hartford, we ended up going to New Haven. It was just a local bus not a Greyhound type of bus. I really didn't want to go that far but I had no choice because it happened. I was really distraught because I had in my pocket 2 checks for 2 bills I was going to pay and I noticed after getting on the bus that instead of putting in checks for the bills, I had put in 2 canceled checks instead. I couldn't fix it, and part of me asked if I should take out the canceled checks and chance putting cash in there instead, because I had no way of writing out new checks. I decided to go home later and fix them up even though I was supposed to mail them today. Then we got to [a state university] and there was a lady there, an administrator of [another town] who said "oh, you can't run things by yourself you always have to have your assistant with you" and I said "no, I've run seminars on my own without an assistant and the kids that were there really liked them" so I was trying to convince her that I could do all that stuff. And then we had the radio on and it was WPOP and instead of being sports there was a children's format all the time, they played children's programming. There was another lady there named Jan that I knew and she wanted to be reimbursed for things that she had bought, clothes that she had bought and I said "no we couldn't do that" I was pretty sure the system wouldn't let me do that, because she ended up being a client and she wanted to be reimbursed for stuff.

I was at work and there was a new lady doing my counseling job and she had been a friend of mine a long time ago and she said "yeah, I'm doing this now. I go to meet with this guy S and he tells me how to handle different things." I said "yeah, I used to do that when I first started too" but I don't do that now cause I don't have S now. And it was like I missed what she used to have because things had changed and I remember how good they were for me in the beginning and how I used to like the job and how I don't like the job anymore because I don't have S the way she did. So I said "well, that's good." (134 words)

People were playing these musical instruments at a big, ballfield, sounded like an autoharp or a musicbox.

We were about to sit down to dinner and it was about 50 degrees out about 5pm and I said I can't now, I have to take Betty out. So I took Betty out and then came back and ate. A while later we were walking and Betty did something really strange, we had started to cross the street and she stopped about two thirds of the way across the street. I couldn't get her to go and I was really frustrated. I tried repeatedly to get her to go and she wouldn't go and then somebody said there's a dog on the other side of the curb, the up-curb on the left hand side eating kibble and Betty wants to get the dog's space so she can eat and I said "oh that ,makes sense then". Then we were in some kind of a store and this lady said she was going to buy some kind of shampoo for her dog, but it was a grocery store and I didn't think they had dog shampoo. I said "if you can buy dog shampoo here for your dog, maybe I can buy some for Betty too" And then we bought cards but we had to take them home first and write some stuff in it, we couldn't just give them away as they were, so somebody helped me do mine.

I had made an appointment with my hairdresser to get a permanent. I went there and the hairdresser said that there were some changes. I sat down in the chair and she pushed a button somewhere and these scissors came out of the wall I think, and began to cut my hair. They were automatic. They would cut for so long and then they would stop. I could hear this noise, this motor, I guess they were going back into the wall or wherever they came from. She said "that's fine, this won't hurt you, sit down in this chair." I did and all these rollers came out and went where they should go automatically. Then she said I would have to go under the dryer and I said there wasn't one. She said "Oh no, you have to stand up under the dryer." I did and the dryer was there and she pushed a button and the dryer came on and dried my hair off. Of course she had shampooed it first and put all that gunk in it. She had this little machine which was on for 20 minutes or so, this dryer thing. Then she said "I've got to put on the neutralizer, the stuff you have to put on your hair to make the permanent perm. Then she said come over to this part of the room and I went and she brought me over to another machine and she said "put your head back." There was no sink there or anything like there usually is. Then this lotion came out from this place in the wall I guess. When it was over, she said that she wanted to give me a blow cut so I had to go back to the dryer again. In real life my hairdresser does all these things herself but in the dream it was all done automatically. I don't know if she had robots or what. I remember her telling me that the equipment had just come and she wanted to try it out and so I guess I was playing her guinea pig. (354 words)

We were in Stop and Shop, shopping, but they were having this contest in which they gave you this amount of time where someone would come around and tap you on the shoulder and say things: "Soups" then we'd have to go where the canned soups were. Then we'd have to collect as many cans of soup as we could within 5 minutes or something. Then they'd come around and tap you again and say "bread" then we'd have to go to the bread aisle and collect as much as you could within 5 minutes. Or they'd say "frozen foods" and we'd go off through the store like that. But the thing was, they had carriages everywhere so you could do this thing. My mother-in-law was in this dream, somehow, impossible because she passed away in 1994. My father-in-law's current wife, Rebecca was in the dream.

I am at a social club that I belong to listening to a woman that I know, a very poor reader who always screws up names and mentions people on lists who have been dead for years. She is reciting poetry to the room which is full of people who are all in wheelchairs. She is reciting the poetry very badly and everyone is so bored that they leave, except for me. I stay and listen to her. (78 words)

I was at a spiritual retreat weekend and there was a bunch of us sitting around a living room with comfortable chairs and soft rugs and having a relaxed discussion about our feelings and thoughts we were having and the character, Andrew the Angel of Death from the TV show "Touched by an Angel" appeared I asked him what he was doing here, he was supposed to be on the TV show and he told me he was here for me. I tried to deny him, telling him he wasn't supposed to be here and that I wasn't ready to go home yet. He said "well, touch your face." On my face were these soft, squishy things like soft pimples but they were very sore and they started to spread all over and he said "you're not going to be with us long." And I happened to hear my mother's voice saying she's dying. And I said, "this isn't fair and if you're going to do this you'll have to take care of Sammy my guide dog and make sure she gets back to my family because I don't want her to be abandoned. And he said he would and I said then it's okay to take me. (208 words)

I was contacted by The Guiding Dogs via tape and letter. I was sitting at my hard maple, dining room table in my living room, reviewing my mail. I could feel the sun falling on my face and it felt warm and good. I listened to the tape on a tape recorder and it said that it was time for me to get another guide dog. I didn't want to do this because my guide dog is healthy. I contacted them in this dream and asked them why it was necessary for me to go back for another when Sammy was healthy and they just said because I needed one. I didn't want to go back. I dreamed that I went back and it was so real because they gave me this new guide dog who was huge and I'm not this tall and they told me his name and I told them that I didn't want this dog.

We were having a bad thunderstorm. The thunder was banging quite loudly, in fact it sounded like an explosion. During the dream I thought that that I had awakened, and to my horror I found that I no longer had a quilt on my bed. My guide dog is afraid of thunder and I thought she had chewed the whole quilt. When I first brought her home from the Guiding Dogs, she had licked a leash and quietly chewed it apart and I thought she had done the same thing to my quilt and would become sick When I awoke for real, I discovered it was thundering and raining.

I was sent back to college to go to this course work for rehabilitation counselors/teachers. Since I already had my teaching certificate, I was sent back to get it renewed. I was in this big classroom at Boston College where I had never really been. It was a typical room with the chairs with the little half desks. I was taking a test so I could be except from some of the course work and saying to myself, "Gosh, I'm really almost too old to be going back to school again, why am I doing this?" (96 words)

I was on a farm, it was springtime, there was a warm breeze blowing on my face, the sun was shining, I could feel it on my eyes and on my shoulders. I was riding a horse. The horse had that thick mane, that you could touch, with that hair that is sometimes on the coarse side. It had that very strong scent that horses have, you could smell the pungent hay as well and I was also inhaling the fresh warm air as I rode on this horse on this farm, and I was feeling relaxed and happy because I had nothing to worry about.

I was at my grandmother's house and I was feeling happy because I was in her kitchen. It was cold outside, the snow was falling. I guess I had gone outside just before I went into the kitchen because I remember the snowflakes kind of falling on my eyelashes and falling on my hair, my hair was wet. I went into her kitchen and she was baking my favorite kind of cookie which was chocolate chip and asking me if I wanted to help her bake cookies and I always enjoyed doing that because it meant that we would be sharing them with other people. So I was sitting there baking cookies with my grandma in her kitchen and just feeling really good about this until I awoke and realized that I had to get up and go back to work. (141 words)

I was sitting at work and I reached down to see if Sammy was okay and I couldn't find her. I looked on the floor under my desk, I looked to the side, reaching around to see if I could touch her, I couldn't find her and I started to call her, "Sammy! Sammy! Where are you I can't find you!" And she didn't come back. My heart started beating real fast. I couldn't find her and the person who was supposed to be helping me with my driving, said "Sammy's around, don't worry about her." But I couldn't find her anywhere and so I started to go up and down the halls, thought it might be smart to take my white cane with me in case I happen to come across any obstacles. I was walking up and down the hall and no one had seen her. Then somebody told me that someone had scared her and she had run down the stairs and the front door was open and she had run out, so I ran down 3 flights of stairs from my office and out the front door and I was calling her and I couldn't find her and I was screaming for people to help me look for her and nobody was helping and everybody told me that she'd come back and the day went by and I was panicked and Sammy wasn't there and I finally woke up and I couldn't find Sammy and I started to scream for her and I guess I woke her up too and she touched me as if to indicate "why had I done that?"

I was at a rehabilitation center for the blind. I had been sent there by my agency to find out if they were wasting the money we spent there for clients we sent there. For instance were they saying that our clients needed more services and not delivering them but only using the money for their own gain? So I was kind of like an investigative reporter. When I was told I had to go I felt kind of strange because I hadn't done that kind of work before and I told my supervisor I don't want to do this, I'm not the qualified person to do this job. He said "you're exactly what we need because nobody will suspect you. In fact we're going to send you as we would a client except you're going to be taking all these notes and asking all these questions and they won't suspect you. Well, I thought about it and I said to him; "All of this will be a challenge, where am I going?" And he said not to the nearby rehab center in Pennsylvania, I was kind of hoping for that one because that's where the Philadelphia Flyers were. He said I know you like hockey, but we're not sending you there and we're not sending you anywhere on the East coast. We're sending you out to Little Rock Arkansas. And I said "Little Rock, Arkansas! The center out there? Its hot and humid here in the summer and you're going to send me out there? " He said, that's what we've decided to do, Mr. Flip, the head of the agency has selected you to go and they gave me the airplane tickets. I recall calling the cab and taking a ride to Dunkirk Airport, which is always a hectic airport to go into and I talked to Sammy, I was saying to her, "now Sammy, I know you don't like to fly, it always makes you a little nervous when we take off and land, once we get up there I know you're okay, but you always get a ,little nervous so you relax." And I petted her and I reached into my purse and gave her a Milkbone dog biscuit and we flew to Little Rock and they announced the plane was landing and I woke up. (390 words)

I was in a great big store. But it wasn't a department store it was filled with music boxes. Small ones that played little tunes, and the ones I've always wanted to listen to and maybe buy, the big antique music boxes that had these disks that you could play and have several different tunes on them. I was just listening to those music boxes letting the music kind of surround me and hear the different sounds, the bell-like sounds, the different kinds of music box sounds you can hear... and not only did this shop have music boxes, but it also had all kinds of great things that had music inside them. They had musical clocks, it had a music clock that had a talking announcement before the time of alarm in the morning. It talked so that I could set the alarm myself. They had a radio which gave you the choice of regular music and music box music. There were just all kinds of music boxes there. I reached into my purse because I decided that I wanted to buy some of the music boxes and nothing was inside there, no money and no credit cards to pay for them. I woke up feeling kind of ridiculous. (210 words)

I was standing in my bedroom which has a bureau a bed and a smaller dresser and a couple of tables that I have a tape recorder on and which I listen to when I am listening to tapes. It has a little tiny drawer inside and I have another table with a telephone on it and a few things like that. I was sitting on a chair on one side of my bed and I heard this voice and this person, this voice said to me "How would you like to be able to fly whenever you wanted to?" I said "That sounds kind of interesting, different, but first of all who are you?" And the voice said "My name is Flora." And I said "How am I supposed to fly if I can't tell where I'm going?" And she said "Well, you can just say where you want to go and you'll get there." And that sounded kind of neat, that would save all my transportation problems and I could choose whenever I wanted to do this. So I asked what I needed to do. She handed me this can that smelled like it had had baby powder in it. She said "Just sprinkle some of it on your arms." So I did and she told me, "Just flap them." I did and the next thing I knew was that I had flown out of my room and down the stairs and I was in my livingroom. So I thought this was kind of fun, and I realized that I was getting pretty low on groceries I think I'd like to go grocery shopping so as I was about to go I asked "How am I supposed to take my guide dog with me?" She said "Put a little of that powder on your guide dog too and hold onto the harness, flap an arm and hold onto the leash and the dog will come up with you." So I decided okay, sounds good to me, we started out. We stepped outside, closed the door, locked it stepped down and didn't say "forward Sammy." I said "We're going to do something different and I took her leash and flapped my arms, we went up in the air and I was thinking, I want to go to Shop and Save, they've got good buys there, so off we went. The next thing I knew, I was in the grocery store, but I forgot to ask how I was supposed to manage after I got the groceries. (427 words)

And she said "Yeah, I know, but I'm far away and can't get to you." I said "Where are you" and she said "I've been out in Colorado, but I haven't been following my program the way I promised you and grandma and my mom and dad, I've stopped taking those drugs and I didn't take money from you guys and I'm sorry" and I said, "I'm sorry too, I want to help, but you need more help than I can give you. You need to go to a treatment place and I'll help you get there" and she said "Okay but I can't do it by myself" and I said "I know you can't and that's why we're here and that's why we've always been here when you've gone through the different programs." She said "I know, but I've really messed myself up, I thought I could handle it and I didn't and now nothings going right and I've got to get help. Help me." I ran down the stairs in my [indecipherable] and I checked the front door and yelled her name and I ran to the back door and called her again and I thought, "She's right, she's far far away and I can't find her. I'd have her come here if I could and I'd take care of her but I can't find her or I'd get her the help." The I heard laughter, almost wicked laughter and I thought people were laughing at me for feeling the way that I was and then I heard sad music, like funeral hymns and tears were coming out of my eyes.

I could also smell some of the wild flowers that have that sweet. Real sweet kind of perfume smell. And I was just walking by myself, no one else was around, I was walking, my guide dog was with me, and we were just going through the woods. We passed a little brook and I listened to the rippling sound of the water and decided to sit down because there was a tree there and it was shady and I decided to take a rest. I fell asleep near the tree and then I woke up and continued on my way in the dream, and kept walking through the woods. I decided to go home, I looked at my Braille watch which was on my wrist and discovered it was afternoon, so I walked back home to my condo. (176 words)

They separated me from Sammy and I said to them, "Please, I can do without food and things like that but please don't take me away from Sammy. Sammy means a lot to me and I wouldn't do that to you."

And they said that she'd work for us or they'd kill her. The person decide to try and work with Sammy and when she didn't go with them, they said they killed her.

I was visiting my sister in Stamford. She has a nice little house, not far from the beach. I walked down to the beach with Sammy and my sister and my 3 little nephews. I could smell the salt air and I could hear the ocean's waves. I could hear the seagulls as they made that mournful cry, while they're either looking for pray or whatever seagulls do. I felt the warmth of the sun on my face, on my shoulders. It felt warm, I kicked off my shoes and picked them up so that I would have them layer and began walking barefoot through the sand. I felt the warm sand between my toes and I felt happy, until I heard a firecracker. The firecracker was awfully close to me and it was very loud, my ears were ringing, I was afraid Sammy had gotten hurt. Luckily the firecracker had missed me this time, but I jumped or jerked a little bit and woke up. (166 words)

I was sitting in my condominium and I heard my computer start talking to me. I was curious as to how this was happening since I hadn't turned it on or connected my speech synthesizer so the computer could talk to me or tell me what was on the screen. Actually there was nothing on the screen but the computer was speaking anyway. It asked me what I wanted and I said I would want to go anywhere that I needed to get to without having to ask other people. So it said, "Okay, lets make a program so you can put down all of the places you usually have to get to." And I started to argue with it and asked it all kinds of questions like "how can all this be happening? I can't drive so what difference does it make if I make out a program?" The computer told me not to be so doubtful. Just pick out the places on the program I wanted included. So I did and it was explained to me that I would tell my computer where I wanted to go and I would get there. I was pretty skeptical because a lot of these pie in the sky things don't work. So I said "Okay, I want to go shopping at the little plaza where the Ames used to be, because there are a bunch of neat stores. Its also more fun to go with somebody and so I want to take Hilda (a blind friend) with me." So I called her in my room, I grasped the telephone, and made a quick call and said "lets go shopping, my computer just talked to me and I programmed it in to know that I wanted to go different places." So we did this. I told the computer I wanted to go shopping top that little plaza, walked into the plaza, went into some of the different stores, the Radio Shack, the Card shop where you can buy all kinds of cards and little gifts, then we went to the bakery where we smelled the aroma of coffee cakes and cookies and all kinds of rich, fattening pastries. Then we went to the shoe store which isn't really there anymore but we went there anyway, and I bought some more shoes. Then there was a department store there and I found some more music boxes, so I bought some of those too. And we found a clothing store and Hilda wanted to buy some clothes, some new dresses and things so I decided to check out those too. And everybody was helpful. Then after we'd had enough shopping, I decided it was time to go home. I had my little palm top computer and I told it through a series of commands to tell my other computer that we needed to get home. A car came and we got home. (488 words)

I was at my nephew John's birthday party. There were a bunch of little kids around, laughing, screaming, yelling and he was opening up his gifts. They opened up the gifts before the birthday cake because, he just was too anxious not to open the gifts first. Then we sang happy birthday and we had some birthday cake. We were out on the lawn of my brother and sister in law's house. Its a small yard but there was soft, green grass and there was enough room for all of us to sit down on the grass and eat the birthday cake. It was my favorite kind. It was chocolate cake with lots of rich, chocolate icing. My nephew got a present which he didn't like, it was a piece of jewelry and it was a heart pendant on a chain and he gave it to me and he said "Gee, why don't you take that you like to wear those." So I took it and tried it on and it was gold, it was very smooth, the chain was also very smooth with one of those little clasps on it, they call a lobster claw clasp that you open with your finger nail and slide the other clasp into it. I told him I would wear that all the time. (221 words)

We had a violent thunderstorm. Sammy has hated them ever since I got hurt by a firecracker. Any kind of loud clapping noise or banging noise like that. That low type sound bothers her. I was telling her to be a good girl and to stay on her rug, then we heard a really loud clap of thunder, the kind that sounds like it hit another object and it sounds like something might catch fire, its really loud and shakes everything and echoes through the air. Well, Sammy disobeyed me and leaped onto my bed, so I had about 70 pounds of dog on top of my stomach. I told her to get off my stomach, to get down, then she started to dig her little claws and paws into me to hold onto me. They were really sharp and it actually hurt a little bit. She wouldn't get down. I jerked awake to discover that it had been thundering and there was Sammy on top of my stomach and she wouldn't get down. (174 words)

I was in my condo, asleep, in bed, and I heard some strange sounds coming from downstairs. I had locked both the front and back doors, the windows were also closed because I had the air conditioner on and I couldn't figure out how anybody could be in there. But then I smelled meat frying in the kitchen and I heard people walking around and so I thought I'd better investigate. I put my slippers on, rubbed my eyes, threw on a robe and headed down the stairs very carefully, cause I felt like I was only half awake. I heard people talking in the kitchen and I said "Who are you." And a woman said, "Well, we were here and my son and I were hungry and we wanted to have some meat, so I'm frying it in a pan with some eggs." And I said "I don't mind giving people some food, but I'd like to know how you got into my condominium." And she said, well, we just touched the door and it was locked but we wiggled it a little more and it opened so we walked in." So I asked her where she lived and she said "Yeah, they had a house but it was too early to go grocery shopping and they just needed some food." So I made some coffee in my drip coffee maker, cause I said to her, "Well, as long as you're eating breakfast you might as well have some coffee too." And I had some orange juice, so I gave her son and her some of that and then I washed the dishes. Then I said to her, "Gee, you can't just go without having some other kind of food so I opened the lower kitchen cabinets where I keep all of my canned goods and I went through to find some goods that she could utilize and I also took out some macaroni from the upper cabinet, where I keep extra boxes of macaroni on hand, and I gave her some of that. I gave her a can of baked beans so she could mix that with the macaroni because the beans have tomato sauce on them and they can make a little supper. I gave her crackers and peanut butter because I knew that wouldn't spoil, I gave her some tuna fish, then I gave her some bread from the refrigerator so that she and her son could make sandwiches and some soda in cans. They thanked me and went out the door. This was so strange that when I woke up I actually went downstairs in my robe to check whether or not I had left the stove on. (453 words)

I was back at Guiding Dogs again although Sammy was still alive, she just couldn't guide anymore. I don't know if she couldn't or wouldn't because she was just tired of it and so I was getting a new dog. They gave me this huge dog, I think the person said it was a "Masty" dog, but I believe the correct word is a Mastiff. It was a huge dog and I was disappointed because I didn't want a huge dog, they're hard when you take them on buses and things. I told the instructor. "I really don't want that kind of dog." And they said "Okay, we'll give you another one." And they happened to have another like Sammy, another Chocolate Lab. I remember training with the dog and then coming home and then I introduced Sammy to the dog and they were friends and I woke up. (149 words)

Whatever paper you draw, that's what you'll be teaching and in my dream I could definitely hear voices, echoes, but there are no bodies. They're like spirit.

There was no body, no head, face height, his voice is the male voice of Harry and the hammer is the typical sound of the hammer, but the hand part holding the hammer is just spirit.

My brother Sam was there, I guess it was his car in the garage and he said "Well I can't see anything burning." And I said "Well I can smell it." And I said "Well, we've got to get out of here." There were a bunch of other people, some were blind and some that weren't and finally when the smell got too much, we all ran and he said "Well, I'll get you to where the woods meets the edge of the road." He leaves the dream but somehow gets us to the edge of this road I don't know how I knew the car was in the garage, I just sensed it. It wasn't a color or a specific size, I just knew that it was in there and was burning up. (182 words)

I'm with people. I don't quite recognize all of the people. There is some kind of religious person there, not necessarily a priest or a minister, but it was somebody who prays anyway. He was asking me a bunch of questions and then said "Its election time and Tom Tailor, a blind person and friend of mine said to me "He is no longer the chair person of this group, you are and you have to run the meeting and ask the questions... but I didn't know what kind of meeting it was, it wasn't a blind meeting, it was kind of festive with soda and coffee and party snacks and drinks Again, no body figures, only spirit figures.

This is an embarrassing dream. I had this dream that something was coming out of me vaginally and I gathered it up in a plastic zip lock bag type thing. It was like the substance of cooked spaghetti. I put it in this bag and walked toward the kitchen as if I was walking out my kitchen door to throw it out and in my dream I said to my husband "If you still love me and are still watching me, just elevate my pillow and I'll know that you're in a better place." But then as I awoke, I told him to go back to heaven where its a better place and not to follow my request. (118 words)

I had this weird dream. I was at a Waldbaum's Food Mart, at the cashiers place and somehow I told her that I had to take this liquid medicine that the gynecologist had prescribed, I asked her if she could tell me how much to take. She said "This isn't liquid medicine, this is nitroglycerin for your heart." I said "I don't have any trouble with my heart." But I took them from the cashier and somehow I wound up at a place with round picnic tables and there were a bunch of people there, males and females that I didn't know. I asked someone about this stuff, this liquid like a Maalox or something that I should be taking for my stomach. They said "Oh, those are heart pills, do you have trouble with your heart?" and I said, "No." and I ended up putting the bottle of pills in the shower. It was still sealed. How the shower got into it I do not know. (167 words)

I was with two people whom I could not identify. It was mainly conversation with two people but I don't know what we were talking about. It was a couple. I was in this place, nothing necessarily familiar although I had a job and this couple was telling me what I had to do. I had to go up to the top floor, and in reality I am petrified of elevators and so I told them that I would take the stairs and they said, "You don't want to take the stairs because they're in worse shape than the elevators." But I decided I would take the stairs and It was some sort of four day work thing. As I climbed the stairs, they started off fine, but as I climbed higher, the stairs became more and more rickety and shaky and wobbly and I was thinking "Oh my God, what are they going to be like when I get to the real top?" And then somewhere in all of this I realized that I had to be in Washington DC in two days although the job was supposed to be four days. The couple sort of leaves. My friend who usually drives me to Washington DC came into my dream. I thought "How do I get down? I'm in the middle of these rickety stairs and I either have to go up and complete the job and miss Washington or I start on down and although I don't remember climbing down the stairs, I must have because I remember asking my driver if he would take me to Washington.

I am walking over some difficult terrain, up a hill, over rocks etc. There are always 2 ways to deal. Jesus is there pulling me, assisting me with the difficult way and the devil is there too, guiding me toward a much easier, pleasanter route; fields of flowers and cool breezes, paved paths and so forth. The odd thing is, both Jesus and the devil look alike in the dream. Their faces are both smooth, unlined, clean shaven, like a baby's cheeks. They sometimes are pulling in opposite directions but there is no hostility or violence. I would always wake up just as I noticed their similarity. (107 words)

I dreamed of a married couple that I really know and they were visiting in my home. I was sitting with a lady Peggy and Donald, I could hear in another room something about how he would like a cold beer and I realized that all of the beer that I had in the house was warm and I did say to Peggy "Did she mind if I asked Don to go to the store and just get some cold beer?" She got so upset! To console her I reached out to stroke her hair. It was long, I could feel it, and it was permed and my feeling in the dream was complete puzzlement at her reaction to a simple request about the store. (125 words)

In my dream I was hungry and I was fixing this plate of food for myself. I had some hard boiled eggs, that I had cut lengthwise, in half, I had some chips I had put on the plate, I was cubing cheese and I put crackers and olives. This was very typical of me, if I wasn't having the usual sandwiches and potato chips for lunch, it would be very typical of me to fix this sort of a picnic plate for myself.

This is kind of humorous, a lovely couple that I know, Bill and Barbara, Barb is just the sweetest lady, good sense of humor, love to be around her, so the incongruity of this is kind of funny: I was sitting in a chair holding a baby girl, and I guessed that she was about 8 months old. I was talking to the baby and I referred to her as "Little Party Girl" and I am sure I meant it as a word of endearment, Barbara's reaction was just completely baffling to me. She took the baby from me very gently, but her voice was rather testy and she said "I'll take her now. No party girl!" (117 words)

Betsy is a lovely lady that I serve on committees with and I think a lot of her, I have known her for 50 years almost. Betsy and I were on the grounds of our childhood school for the blind, I think. Our purpose for being there was that there was a meeting with a good sized committee that she and I would both be attending. But I also had the strong feeling that I wanted to talk to Betsy about other than political issues and it was one of those times when you knew you were going to be talking well into the night, like when you get together with an old friend and there's lots of catching up to do.

Back, right after I graduated from high school I worked for five years for a group of radiologists, I was a dark room technician and I was back there working, in my dream. The office appeared exactly the way it was, structurally, but who was there but the executive director of the state agency for the blind.

I was a candidate for the witness protection program and I dreamed that I was being relocated to California. I was extremely upset and sobbing hysterically because of the thought of never seeing friends or family again. The morning of the day that I was supposed to leave, for some reason I was up, stripping beds. I could feel the sheets in my hands, once I bent down and touched a bare mattress. But then I paused and realized that I didn't even know what was expected of me, why was I stripping beds? I don't even know what I am supposed to be bringing with me. (107 words)

Everywhere that I touched, I was finding clutter. There was a lot of dirty laundry. If I touched the floor I would feel a small pile of dirty laundry. I opened up a drawer of a night stand and pulled out a rolled up dirty dishtowel. The scene changed then and I was at my daughter Robin's house. Where she was living in the dream was not her real house, it seemed that her house was a good sized house and for some reason my son and I had to walk home. We were in a very small entryway, I knew that I was going to be carrying something as we walked home. I don't know what it was but I knew it was going to be cumbersome and so would interfere with easy walking. I considered taking a bus. Anyway, my son, knowing that we were going to have to walk home, or because I had led him to believe so, he walked out the door and it was raining so I brought him back inside because I realized he was in his stocking feet. I bent down to help him find and put on his shoes and I felt that his little socks were wet naturally because he had stepped on wet ground. Then the scene changed again and however we got back here, we were back in our own apartment and there was someone here to visit and she was sitting on my son's bed. She is a very good friend of mine, a lady close to my age, and she greeted us and I knew by her voice who it was and I knew at the same time that I was thinking about my son's grandmother. In the background, in another room, a radio was playing. I also heard the phone ringing. The phone was on a wall, not where it really is in my kitchen. I reached to pick it up and that's where I woke up because my phone was really ringing. (338 words)

I was holding a waste basket and I was picking up trash from the front porch and front lawn. Pieces of rolled up newspaper, paper I was putting it into this basket and from this basket I poured it into a cardboard carton because it was trash day, the barrels were out by the curb and I was going to put this box and all into the barrel. But then I realized that the trash truck was already there and because of our method of pick-up which involves the hydraulic arms where they pick up the whole barrel and dump it into the truck, I was concerned that it would be unsafe for me to go over there and drop this box into the barrel. Then I heard someone outside of the truck who let me know that it would be perfectly safe to do it and I did. (149 words)

Here I am again with clothes. I was pulling clothes, linen and clothing, this time not dirty, they were clean, I knew it, I was not pulling them straight up out of a laundry basket, Instead I was pulling them toward me. It was comparable to a very, very large glove compartment, it was very deep. I am saying glove compartment so you will understand how I was pulling out that way, and I'm pulling and pulling these sheets and pieces of clothing that need to be folded and put away. By the time the dream ended, I had made a very large dent in this mess of clean laundry. (110 words)

There was another girl her name was Lindsy, much younger than I, but Lindsy and I had been taken to the basement of a building, don't know by whom, there was one person there who seemed to be in control of us. I had a feeling this was a gang related thing. I had no clue; what we were supposed to have done, what they thought we had done, but he had placed 2 high stools, like the ones at my breakfast bar, up against a brick wall. Lindsy was already seated on hers, I was still standing, being given my instructions by this creep, who had handed us each, I don't know if these were packages of juice, made of a type of heavy duty foil paper, very good for like taking to a beach or something,. She already had hers and I was being handed mine, and hearing the instructions, however these 2 bags were filled with oil. We were being instructed to sit on these stools and drink this oil. I could hear Lindsy, it was terrible, out of fear or absolute obedience, was drinking this stuff down like a glass of water if you were thirsty. I could hear her swallowing and I remember thinking "I can't drink this poison, its going to make me very sick." Right after I heard her drinking, I heard this extremely violent vomiting, it was Lindsy, which then induced my own. I had raised mine to my lips but I never did take a drink of it. Thank goodness, the scene changed and I was in the same building, but in a higher level of it and I was in what felt like a very large, comfortable apartment that was mine. It was my living quarters. A neighbor had come over from across the hall telling me there was something on TV which I might enjoy watching and I said, "Yes, that I would, thank you, I'll watch it on my own." He became a little bit offended and wanted to know why and I said "Because if I want to get up and fix myself a cup of coffee or something, I could." The scene changed one more time and I was walking down, the same building, I left my apartment evidently, I was walking down a rather long corridor, and I was being careful, I was being careful because I didn't know what obstacles might be in the way. I reached the end of it and I went through a door and was on the outside of the building. Oddly, outside of the building, I felt counter tops that had cabinets underneath just like you would have in a kitchen, and I was opening them up to investigate, I found there were some dishes, some of which were perfectly empty. Everything was very dirty and I remember thinking "What an absolute waste of good material, and why would anyone want to live like this out doors?". (498 words)

I was in a place I was unfamiliar with but I was in the living room, I knew that. I was sitting on the floor in the middle of the room. There was no furnishings in it at all, I have no idea why I was there. I was aware that behind me, sort of at the far wall there were 2 boys. They seemed oriental I could hear their murmured voices, but I couldn't understand what they were saying because I do believe they were talking in their native tongue. I knew though, that these 2 boys had been brought there to be tortured before being killed. Now in the kitchen which was in front of me, there was another boy, and all of them seemed to be around the same age and I would guess, from the voices, 10 or 11 years old. The one in the kitchen didn't seem to be in any particular danger, he was just out there playing with a small sized ball I would say, a Ping-Pong ball or a superball or maybe he was just simply bouncing it around. I don't know what happened. I don't want to know. (197 words)

I'm back at my old job again, the radiology office. I told you I was a darkroom tech, and in the dream I was back in the very familiar darkroom. One of the first jobs of the day was to turn on the darkroom dryers where the film would go to be dried. I was trying to turn these 2 switches on. The top one worked fine, the bottom one was defective. I got irritated, I knew there was a short in it but there was a female patient in my darkroom standing at the top part of the dryer which is like a counter top. She was standing there writing out the last of her wedding invitations. I wanted her to get out of my way. Also in that room was a device called a pass box. That's a lead lined box where the films, in their lead cases, were passed between the x-ray room and the darkroom so that they were totally safe from any light exposure. I reached my hand up, on top of this pass box for some reason and there was a whole stack of already done wedding invitations and then a friend of mine, Neal was there and I don't know what he was supposed to be doing, but he was conducting some kind of a raffle. If you put in two 5 dollar bills, and if you were very lucky, it could increase to 200 dollars so I took my wallet and gave him a 10 dollar bill, thinking that that should be as good as two 5 dollar bills, or does he really want two 5's.

I was there things were in quite a bit of disorder, my reason for being there, again, was a meeting that I was supposed to be attending.

I am sitting in Sandra's kitchen. I know its a kitchen because it is very similar to my kitchen. The layout is exactly the same. I am eating some delicious sandwiches made out of crusty rye bread and ham and cheese. Big, thick sandwiches. In reality I have no idea who this Sandra is but in my dreams I appear to know her. She is a German woman with a high voice and a very pleasant accent, she's very friendly. I am enjoying these delicious sandwiches so much that I don't want to leave, but I have to catch a train. I know I have to catch a train, I keep telling Sandra that I have to catch a train but she keeps offering me more sandwiches and I keep staying to eat them even though I have to catch this train to where ever it is, I don't know where. It's not made clear in the dream. I remember the taste of the delicious ham and cheese and the rye bread, hearing Sandra's laughter and high pitched chatter, being aware of being in her kitchen, sitting at her table, touching the table with my fingertips, tapping my feet on the floor and this impending urgency to catch this train, although it wasn't so urgent, I really didn't want to leave because I was enjoying her company and the sandwiches so much.

And I said to him, "If you're in Shreveport Hospital, then who is that man we buried?" And he started to laugh and he said "I don't know, but its not my problem."

I always wished that I could drive although this is the first dream I have ever had where I'm doing it. The main senses I used in this were hearing because I could listen to him and hear what he was saying, I could hear the other traffic around me. And feeling.

I was at the [childhood school for the blind] that I attended from k to 9. The weird thing was, my sister Sally was with me. She's older than I am, about 6 years older. In the dream she was the same age that she is now, but I was about 14 or so. And I was very upset because I couldn't find my way to all of my classes and I wanted her to show me around the campus. And she said she would but she kept saying "I'm gonna be late for work! I'm going to be late for work!" The school was in LeBlanc and she works in Pierre, about 60 miles away, but it was really a strange dream because when I was 14 at school, my sister was 18 and she was not working in Pierre at that point. The sense I used was primarily hearing because I was talking to her and she was talking to me and touch, I could feel myself walking with her. (167 words)

In the dream I was laying in bed, I was with Jim, he had his arms around me, and he kept saying, "Oh, its so good to have you back in my arms again." That's all that he kept saying. It was funny, because it wasn't a sexual dream, it was more a comfort dream, it was comforting to be with him and the senses I used were three of course; hearing, I could hear him talking to me, touch, I could feel his arms around me, and the mattress and the bedding, and smell, I could smell his cologne. It was not sexual, it was comfortable, peaceful, I enjoyed being with him. (138 words)

Dreamt about my dad again. In this dream we were having a big argument. I think I told you that in reality my mother has Alzheimer's disease, she was just recently diagnosed, there have been a lot of problems with her short term memory and forgetting things, leaving doors open instead of locking them and things like that. In this dream I had a big argument with my father and I said "How can you leave me with this?!" I was so mad because I thought that he had left me to deal with this and he said "I guess you'll just have to deal with it the best you can!" And that's what he would have said. Basically the sense I used in this dream was hearing, we were shouting, we were arguing back and forth with each other. I don't exactly know where we were. We were standing in a room facing each other and yelling at each other, so I could feel myself standing like I normally can. It wasn't a very pleasant dream but it had a sense of reality to it.

I was in the hospital where I work, I was going down the hall with my friends Penelope and Virginia. We were going to the cafeteria for lunch. In reality I frequently have lunch with them. We were walking down the hall when suddenly Virginia and I ended up in her car. Penelope wasn't with us. Virginia and I were suddenly up in her car and she said "Lets not go to the cafeteria, lets go out for lunch." And I said "fine." We were driving somewhere to go to lunch and this song came on the radio, it was not a song I had ever heard before, it was an instrumental, it was very strange, it almost sounded like sitar music, like Indian type music. She liked it but I didn't, but I was in her car so I couldn't say a whole lot and I said "oh" and then it paused and I thought it was over and she said, "oh no, its changing, it'll do a variation, you'll see what it does." And the tune it was playing, when it first came on the radio, it was in a major key and then they did the same thing over but it was in a minor key. The same sort of tune but it was in a minor, it was very strange, and I woke up before the song ended, I was still riding in her car. The senses I used were hearing of course, and touch, I could feel myself sitting in the seat and walking in the hall earlier in the cafeteria I could feel my shoes on the hard floor. (275 words)

Dreamed I was in my computer room in the basement, trying to write a letter, to my friend H, trying to decide whether to put it in Braille or on tape. Then was sitting in front of the window, opening the curtains to feel how warm the sun was then turned back to the computer and could hear opera music from a radio station coming through the computer speaker.

I dreamed I was riding on a bus, thinking we were on the same route that my brother had taken me to get to his boat along a river and we were going around a sharp curve and almost overturned. Also dreamed of being in my attic, moving around up there then trying to find my way back to the steps that come down from the attic. Also dreamt about going up in an elevator, trying to get up to someone's apartment and feeling the elevator for Braille and finding, no I was feeling for room numbers and finding several room numbers on each plaque instead of just one and was confused and didn't know where to go.

I was doing the dinner dishes, my daughter and her boyfriend called to say that they had left a pitcher of milk on the drainer and for me to put it away. Then there was breakfast that I was cleaning up after and my wife had made me 2 cups of tea and I had just, I remember taking the teabags out of both cups and dumping them in the sink and then putting sugar in the tea from the sugarbowl and the spoon I was using was bent so that the spoon part was bent downward and I had to tilt the spoon way back to keep the sugar from running out.

I dreamed I was in a room, I think it was a livingroom, talking to a woman, maybe somebody from church, about classical music, and I was walking across the room carrying a big pop bottle, like a 2 liter bottle only bigger, quite a bit bigger, I was carrying it vertically in front of me, walking across, and she was telling me that her husband likes classical music and I said "I love classical music, especially music that's soft and seductive, and I used to hate classical music" and then we named a couple of programs and she said he liked "The Black Jar" and I had never heard of that program, but in the dream I said "oh yeah, I like that program too" and I started to tell her that I liked a program, I said "Hearts in Space" but that wasn't the name of it5/20/97.

The only dream I remember is a very explicit sexual dream. I was with my wife, and I won't go into detail, but we were talking, and somebody knocked on the door and I went to open the door and I turned sideways so that whoever it was wouldn't see me completely, that's it. We were in the bedroom, making love, doing a lot of things. I was involved in some oral activity and we were talking about trying a different position, she was going to get on top of me which would be highly unusual for us. There was a knock on the door and it was my daughter saying that it was time to go to the hospital to deliver her baby, which in real life, she since has. When I opened the door and realized that I was standing there in my underwear with an erection, I turned aside so that she would be unable to see me. (161 words)

I was coming out of the subway and I met somebody, a man who knew me and he said, "come on, I'll walk with you through the subway, and somebody else came up and they said hello to each other and he said "kiss me on both cheeks, a brassa" and they kissed. I laughed and made a comment about it being strange, 2 guys kissing, and then I thought, that was funny, I shouldn't have said that because one of them is not a guy, one of them is S, a friend of mine from Delaware. The next thing I knew, I was walking with her and I said I had just come from the airport and asked her what she was doing and she said that she wasn't going home until tomorrow so I said "lets go to lunch." Then we were at this school for blind children and I thought we would just go downstairs to the snackbar and have lunch, and we decided not to do that, and I said that there was a pizza shop down the street and she said "well I saw a McDonalds down there" so we started walking and immediately we were at the McDonalds and we went in and somebody was frying doughnuts and I could hear someone saying that they were using all this grease to fry the doughnuts and you could hear them sizzling because of the cheap grease they were using, the donuts weren't good for you to eat, and then the lady said something about the food that was ready and I thought it was mine and I hadn't even ordered yet and finally I did order and that was the end of the dream.

Just came home from the grocery store and was picking up different bottles of aftershave I had bought and was putting them away. I could smell the Old Spice and wondered why I had bought it because I was tired of it and I already had some but I bought it anyway. I had also bought 2 other kinds of aftershave and I remember smelling them and putting them away. (70 words)

We were on vacation with my cousin G, I haven't seen him in years, we went mountain climbing and went up a very rigorous climb that was almost too much for me. We made it to the top, to a little precarious ledge, we were sitting on this thing and all I had to hold onto was a plastic pole, stuck down into this soft, earthy ground, and one little place to put one foot to keep me from falling back down the mountain. I was sitting there thinking how difficult it was and I was scared up there and then my wife was beside me and she said that my twin brother T was down at the bottom, in tears, he was lying down, he just couldn't make it and he was upset and it was just too much for him, and my cousin came up, just walked right up and was having a good time and was talking to us and we told him, we admitted it was just too much for us and he apologized and said he was really sorry and that he just hadn't realized. Then, I remember I had a big 2 liter pop bottle and I was telling my wife some sort of story, explaining to her how much the bottle cost... "it was $1.29" or something like that and here's what happened to it I just threw it off the mountain and it went crashing down to the bottom somewhere. Then we talked for a while. Then there was someone else there, I don't know who it was, but when we were talking about how difficult it was he said, "well I believe in giving it the old Marine try, that means you ask God for help 101 times and usually that works." I was thinking about that. Then we decided to go back down and in going back down, I found that there was a paved way that we could make it, very easily, it was just like a steep slope going down, like a sidewalk. So we went back down, and we were in a house and my cousin was still there and I found this old knife that I wanted to have sharpened. And the blade was split at the tip so it had 2 points, like a fork almost, it was split right in the middle and my cousin showed me, he said "come right on down this other little slope to this ledge", this was still in the house though. He had somehow used the computer to create a vibration so that when I took this knife and held it against the flat surface of the cement, it was vibrating like crazy, and I was able to sharpen the blade by holding it for quite a long while, like 5 minutes on each side, flipping it over, feeling the edge to make sure it was getting sharp and then E, my wife, was lying down right next to us on the couch, trying to sleep and she began to complain about the noise it was making and how it would wake up the neighbors and she said "you know how these people around here swear!" And I said "I don't care, its not making that much noise and they were going to have to put up with it or I might just have to stab somebody! Once I had this thing sharpened" And we all had a good laugh at that. I remember thinking that I've got to get my cousin to explain to me how he did that, how he was able top do that with the computers, setting up that field that would make this knife vibrate.

I was in a mobile home, decided to go have a cup of tea, on the way into the kitchen, I got deluged with some water or something and I stepped in it and it sprayed almost up to my face and I remember thinking that I had almost hit my eye with it. I thought, did the dog wet on the floor, or, I couldn't figure out what it was, and then I walked into the kitchen, and I was in bare feet and didn't have any clothes on and I was walking around in there, touching the refrigerator, and the sink and I was thinking, "boy, I hope there's nothing faulty in here, nothing electrical or I'm going to get shocked because I was in bare feet and it was a tile floor, water on the floor. I walked over too the stove and put the tea kettle on and the electric stove on and was heating up the tea, and went back into the other room and all of a sudden heard this really loud noise, super loud, vibrating noise and at first I thought it was an airplane, I couldn't figure out what it was but it was shaking the whole house, and then it subsided and we never did figure out what it was.

I was at the Pittsburgh Blind Association I think it was, and was sitting beside a man, a friend of mine who was being forced out of his job, he used to be the assistant manager there and he was just sitting there biding his time because there was no work for him to do, he was ready to retire and had been waiting for that to happen, he was on the telephone, talking to somebody, then he got off and then I was on the phone talking to somebody, was talking to him about cassette recorders and he was saying to me that the only problem with this cassette recorder is that you can only put "one resistor battery" in it, whatever that means. Then I remember that my son was supposed to come pick me up but he was out running around. Then I was on a bus, talking to this woman who was a friend of mine but who is dead, and she wasn't dead at that point, I was talking to her about nothing in particular. Then I got off the bus and was walking, holding on to the bus driver's arm with one hand, somebody else with the other and they were both going in different directions, trying to pull me in different directions and I was laughing and said to the bus driver "hey, you guys know you're pulling me in 2 different directions?" So I let go of one of them and walked with him. The next thing I knew there was a cab that I was in with a friend of mine, and we were supposed to get dropped off on the south side but he accidentally dropped us off on the north side. The driver got out and was walking with us, realized we were on the north side. The cabby apologized and we got back in the cab and the driver told us he would take us where we wanted to go.

I was looking for books from a Braille Bible and I had to give some kind of report or do something in church, was looking for a particular book and was having trouble finding it. My friend S was there and while I was feeling around on the shelves trying to find the books I happened to notice there was a nice bugle on the floor. It seemed to have 2 bells on it instead of just one. I thought to myself, "Ooh, as soon as I'm done finding these books I've got to ask S about playing that bugle, see what it sounds like."

Then I dreamed I was sitting in front of my wife who was in a reclining chair and we were talking and started kissing and my son was supposed to be going to an amusement park later that morning ands I was asking her how he was going to get there. She said she was not riding him and we began to make plans for the rest of the day. I was thinking that we would be alone later and that it would be a good time to get some lovemaking in. (92 words)

I was walking with my cane and I started to cross the street and a man and a lady started to help me, seemed like one was holding onto each of my arms and as we crossed I kept thinking that the man was getting too close to me, I could feel the front of him bump against me and I thought he's closer than he should be and it kind of repulsed me and I wanted to get away from him. Then, we got across the street and there was some sort of barrier where they were doing some kind of work. There was a wooden plank there and the people who were doing the work said that they had just finished and that they would open it up so I could walk across. They removed the barrier but left the wooden plank there. I walked across, actually along it, it was following a sidewalk. Then I found myself in someone's house who lives in an alley near us, I have no idea who she was. I found myself sitting at her table and I had a bag with me that had 3 peaches in it. I was sitting at her table, eating her peaches and I couldn't believe the size of the seeds in those peaches, they were just huge! I thought; "these can't be peaches, these have to be some other kind of fruit, because the seeds are just way bigger than they should be." And they didn't even taste like peaches, they were more like figs or some other kind of fruit. (266 words)

I was with my brother, most of the time, sometimes it may have been my so in, I was walking down this path and I came to this wooden bridge and I walked to the end but was afraid to go any further because I thought that it might go into the water. My brother called me back and said "come on, you've got to come back this other way. There was a shed there, a really small, wooden house of a thing, and I could get into it but there was no opening to get out of the other side to get out. He kept calling me and saying "you've got to come through here, this is the only way to get through here to get back." I said "Well, I didn't have to come through here going down, why do I have to go through here going back?" and he said, "well, you just have to. Its too far to go around it." He insisted that I try to get out of this thing and the wood in it was all old and rotted, so I started ripping pieces of it off, until I made room for me to get out. And I kept tearing at it and finally managed to make a space big enough for me to crawl out and drop down to the ground on the other side if it. I felt really guilty about it, thinking "boy, I'm really tearing this place up" and I asked my brother if he thought anybody saw me and he said "yeah! A lot of people did." And I asked him what that shed was for and he said "That's where they do people's taxes." And I felt bad about this and I thought I should really find out who owns this and pay them for ripping it up even though it was in bad shape. Then we were on a bicycle and we were going really fast along these roads, I was riding on the back of it, leaning back on what I remember used to be called a sissy bar. My brother was peddling and we were going so fast it was almost as if we were on a motorcycle. It was a bike though, it was so quiet and he just seemed to be peddling it effortlessly. I remember saying to him "Let's stop at Butler's store on the way home and get something to drink, like a pop or something." The next thing I knew we were in some doctor's office and it had something to do with taxes but they were doing a kind of cursory examination of people and there was a couple across from us we were talking to. A woman came out of the inner office and called me instead of my brother but it was my brother that was supposed to be examined. She called J but I said, "no, its T that you want, his name is T" so he went in with her and I was talking to the couple and I was explaining to them how my brother and I used to go for a few beers when we were young and how we used to drink it by the quart sometimes and all this stuff. And then the man and the woman started to say that they were going to go to a restaurant and get something to eat. He said "Honey, if there was a restaurant near here I would go right now and get us something to eat. (595 words)

I dreamed that I was thinking about how I am different at work because of my blindness and how I'll never be like other people. The next thing I know, I was standing at the kitchen sink eating out of the sink with a fork and I knew exactly what I was eating, I could taste it even. We have some noodles with vegetables, like a pasta salad, that you just put in a microwave and mix with water and heat up. I was eating that out of the sink and I was thinking to myself I shouldn't be eating out of the sink, that's not very sanitary, I should be using a plate, but then I thought, well, I'm blind and that's why I'm eating out of the sink.

I was in a meeting with a bunch of blind people, all friends of mine, and I said to one of them "I forgot to bring my slate and stylus," which is what we write with, and the person next to me said that I could borrow hers and asked if I would take the notes from the meeting with it. I agreed to. The slate was really unusual, it had an extra metal piece in it and the stylus had a plastic flange coming out of both sides of it, and I thought "Boy that's really ingenious, that way if you drop it it won't roll away". So I began to take notes and I could feel the heaviness of the Braille paper, heavier than what I normally use, and I thought "well, I guess I can do it this one time" and I wrote a few things down. Then a male friend, J from [Piedmont] came in, and although I didn't hear his voice, I could hear people greeting him and I got the feeling that he wasn't feeling real well. Then I was outside walking in front of the AT&T building with my new graphite cane which I recently got, and it kept pulling to the left toward the building, almost as if it were a divining rod or something, and I thought that was really strange and I got back in the meeting and I started telling everybody "boy, you know, this new graphite cane really wanted to come into this building, I could feel it pulling towards the left as I walked across in front of the building."

I remember thinking "that's odd, there's 4 people in the front seat and there seems to be room for all of us." (72 words)

We were on a trip somewhere and we made a stop to go to the restrooms. I went into this huge place and was trying to find the urinals and I was having trouble finding them and I think that at one point I had no clothes on, and I didn't quite understand that. I was wandering around in this big square room. At one point my wife came to the door and asked if I was ready to go and I said "I'd be another minute" and I went back in and tried to find a urinal, and I couldn't, and finally some man inside there helped me find it and I went to the bathroom and went back out and got in the car and we went back on our way to wherever we were going. And then I remember the reason we were at this place was to take a urine specimen which I was supposed to bring with me and didn't. So I tried to make a joke I kept calling "I forgot my pee! I forgot my pee!" and everyone was laughing but they weren't going to go back there for it and I thought it was really bad that I'd left it there. (209 words)

I dreamed that I was lying in bed and was touching my wife, and she was getting excited, actually came to climax and I said "we have to get up and go to the bathroom before we continue."

I was at a Council of the Blind meeting and I realized I had been sleeping and I realized that I was secretary and should have been taking notes. I didn't know what to do, I didn't have a tape recorder with me, I hadn't been paying attention, and I didn't even have a slate and stylus. I thought, "should I borrow one from somebody?" ^Then T, one of the other members told me that he wanted me to remind him of something, because he had to do it and I thought I didn't know how I was going to do this. I was just appalled that I had been sitting there sleeping in the meeting. (116 words)

I tried to check the time on my talking clock (and, by the way I have had this dream numerous times over the past few years) but the clock malfunctioned, either the battery was going dead or something, and when I pressed the button for the time it started to say a bunch of things about the computer keyboard, and it was just not acting the way it should at all. I knew there was something wrong with it and I was afraid I had slept in and missed my wake-up time for work. (94 words)

I was in the rearmost seat of a station wagon, where the seat faces back out of the rear of the car. I was sitting on the driver's side and sitting to my left was my Brother in law D from Kentucky. He was driving the vehicle and I remember thinking "boy, I wonder how he's driving this thing from all the way over here in the back." I could tell by his voice that he was turning his head around to look forward to see what's going on but he was talking to me. For the most part we were just riding along and he was looking at me mostly and yet he was able to control the car. (120 words)

I went into this nut shop I used to go into to buy peanuts and cashews and things and I went in and thought, "boy this place is really small, they must have changed it around" which was really weird because they had just taken up half the space that used to belong to Wiener World [which in reality is about a half block away on the other side of an alley] and made the nut shop really big, but now its small again. I went in and talked to the person, trying to decide what kind of nuts I wanted and I couldn't think of anything that sounded good because it was early in the morning and I didn't want peanuts and I didn't want any other kind, but I asked him though, if they had anything they could mix with chocolate covered raisins and they said they didn't have anymore chocolate covered raisins.

I had to cross an intersection, turn left and cross the other way and instead of walking, I got down on my knees and was crawling across and I was thinking "boy, I can hear the traffic better this way than if I was standing up, but it's really hard to go fast enough to make it across before the light changes." I got across and began to turn left and my friend M was there, who is also blind in reality, and he started to tell me "you're going the wrong way, we're going the wrong way." And I said, "This is 4th avenue here isn't it?" and I insisted on going that way and I knew I was right but he kept trying to get me to go the other way. (133 words)

I had to go for a physical and I remember getting there, my wife drove us up, I was supposed to be there at 1:00 and it was 2 minutes to 1:00 when we got there. I checked my watch and said "this is great, we're right on time, its a good thing we left when we did." We got in there and the nurse took me and had me step up on a scale, was weighing me. Then I got up on the table and the doctor came in, he had a deep voice. I remember the sound of his shoes walking, he had a nice firm walk He came in and started talking to me and gave me a shot I asked him what kind of shot it was and he said "It's an ACD shot." My wife is a nurse (in reality) and we were trying to figure out what kind of shot that was. She said she didn't know. He gave me the shot in the upper part of my left arm and it was somewhat painful and I sort of winced a little bit, but I said it didn't hurt that badly. I asked him what it was and he said it was a cardiac shot, maybe hepatitis, I asked what the A was for and he said that was a shot for marijuana. I asked what he meant, and he said "it lessens the effect of marijuana if you smoke it." I laughed and said "Oh great! Now I'll have to smoke twice as much marijuana." And he laughed and I said "no, I don't smoke marijuana" [in reality, not for the last 25 years]. Then, while I was still on the table, there was a loud buzz, a doorbell, but the person rang it excessively long and it was excessively loud, and the doctor groaned "oh boy" but he went to the door and opened it. Then this man with a very effeminate voice came in and said he had flowers to deliver and the doctor said "Oh gosh! Those weren't supposed to be delivered here!" Then he called to his nurse "Bevvv! Come in here and take care of this, these are supposed to be delivered (I think he said) to my wife." So she came in and took care of the man with the flowers. The next thing I remember I was out in my backyard sitting at a picnic table eating dinner with my mother and some other people. My mother was sitting right to my right. I don't remember what we were eating, but the yard was kind of sloped down and we were back towards the end of it and we were sitting there eating and talking. I mentioned to my mother that I had had a shot and said "I bet I could probably drink beer now and I bet I could have a few now." [Reality, I have been a recovering and sober alcoholic for 14 years] And my mother said "Oh, I don't know what I would do if I started to find beer bottles and found out that you were drinking again." I started to laugh and said "well, you know there have been a number of times when I've had a few! It doesn't really bother me if I just drink beer and don't drink too much." She didn't sound too believing but said "oh, that's interesting." My thoughts and been that maybe if this shot for marijuana was effective, it might allow me to drink like a regular drinker without having any bad effects from it. My mother left. They had all left and gone somewhere. I was by myself, and I thought I had better start cleaning up the dishes and I picked up my plate and I had a glass which I left there, and started to walk. I heard a splash and realized that I was right along side of a river and I didn't want to fall in the river, and I couldn't exactly remember which way I had to go to get up to my house. I was pretty sure I could feel that the land sloped a little bit, and I thought I was okay and so I started to walk in generally the right direction, but I sort of veered off to the side of my yard and got tangled up in some bushes that are there. I kept walking and at one point I brushed against a wire antenna that I have in my back yard in reality and I remember thinking "boy this thing is really hanging too low. I should get a pole to prop up the middle with" I kept walking and got myself straightened out and got up to the top near my house, where a patio is and a dishwasher was there, and I started to put my plate inside the dishwasher, and I was going to go back and get some more when I started to hear all these voices from inside my basement. It was my neighbor E from across the street, with a bunch of people and they were talking, it was as if she was giving them a tour of my house. Then she came out and started thanking me and then my mother came out and she thanked us both for being such nice people and being such good help. I remember saying "E you're always welcome." Then she was leaving. (898 words)

I was in a class, possibly for computer programming. There seemed to be many familiar people in the class with me and the instructor was very friendly and it seemed as if I was sitting in the front of the room and he was sitting in the back, and he came up to me and said "I was going to buy you an "Opticon" but the administration wouldn't let me, they cost $6000 but I brought you a Braille writer and I bought you all this other stuff and I just wondered if you were familiar with it because you are going to need them in this class." I remember thinking "I'm glad he didn't buy an Opticon because I don't remember how to use one. So I began to unpack the box he gave me, and there did appear to be an Opticon and had a little hand held camera with it. A little box that had something similar to a little Braille display, maybe a one line Braille display, maybe an Opticon. I started taking out this thing and all the accessories that came with it and I was amazed at the different plugs and cords and there were adapters like standard serial port adapters for computers, there were some that were offset between the male and female end of it. There were some wires with like plastic keys hanging off of them. My co-worker, M happened to be there then and she said "Oh, this is interesting, you could probably stick this in a car's ignition to start it if you happened to lose your key." We had a laugh about that. I just kept looking at these different pieces. There was one piece that I fitted onto the back of the machine with a little flange, it was some sort of little plug. Throughout the dream everything seemed pretty familiar to me and I seemed to know what everything was for. Then M said she had to go and do an interview and I said "where's everybody else?" and she said "I have no idea, they all left at 8:00 and they just left at 8:00 and I'm left with the work to do." [An Opticon is a device which converts printed material into tactile images that actually feel like the printed letters. It has largely gone out of vogue for the last 15 or 20 years.] (368 words)

I was at the school for blind children, walking down the hall in the middle of the night, toward the younger kids' dorm area. For some reason I wanted to go down there and get a drink of water out of the fountain and the house mother stopped me and hollered at me and asked what I was doing there and I said that I just wanted a drink and its a better fountain down here and I thought to myself 'F your mother' and then I thought I'm glad I didn't say that out loud.

I was in the computer room in my basement here and my friend J's daughter was here with me. She was trying to print some stuff and I was helping her with the computer and I was asking her if she ever used Print-Shop. And we were talking about Q&A and WordPerfect and I forgot to run my speech program and was having trouble figuring out where I was and she was kind of helping me. In the dream his daughter, who in reality is 40 sounded like she was 20. Next I remember being at the Guild for the Blind in Hingeville. I was walking through there smoking a pipe and the tobacco smelled really good, like cinnamon [I haven't smoked a pipe in 10 years in reality]. I was walking through there talking to some people and all of a sudden I could hear all these little kids coming in and somebody came over to me and said "do you hear the fire?" At first I said no, but then I heard some sirens off in the distance. They said it was next door at a restaurant which I remember having been in before. Then my wife was there and she was looking and I asked "How bad does it look?" and she said "Oh, it's really a bad fire! A good one, really ablaze." Then she took me over there and we walked into the driveway and we could hear the men up above, working away on the roof. One of the firefighters yelled down "What are you doing here? Get out of here now!" And I responded "I'm just glad I had a chance to hear this." I asked my wife again how it looked and she still said that it looked pretty bad. Then rain started to fall on us but it may have been water from the hose. I said, lets get out of this or we'll have to go home and take a bath. I also remember at some point, being able to smell the smoke, it had a rather acrid smell typical of house fires. (344 words)

[I am a recovering alcoholic who still attends meetings occasionally] I dreamt that I was at a meeting with my sponsor, we generally go on Saturday mornings together. He had spoken during the meeting, it was a discussion meeting, and then 5 minutes before the meeting ended, he repeated, "My name is B and I'm an alcoholic" but then he got all emotional and choked up and couldn't finish what he had wanted to say. He was quite upset and distraught, and I could hear him almost beginning to break down. (81 words)

I was up in my bedroom trying to change a light bulb over a closet door, which isn't really there. While I was changing the one over the bed, which really is there, I also installed something which was squirting water straight down and I don't know what it was for, but it was supposed to be doing it. The problem was it was squirting too much water and I couldn't seem to get it to stop and it just kept going and going and I remember thinking that it might have had something to do with an airplane.

I was in a hotel and I woke up with my wife and I said "Whoa! We're in England!" and we both remembered that we were. We were on a vacation I guess and we were talking and I was listening to the other guests in the other hotel rooms that I could hear. Then I heard a man open our door and I heard him say "Nope, he's not here." Then I heard him go down the hall opening other doors and I could hear him say "His mother's not here." Some kid was lost and they were looking for his mother. But the kid was speaking Spanish, not English. I heard a woman say something to the kid which I understood to mean "Can I pick you up?" He was like a little 2 or 3 year old. I thought I heard her say "Me exceptuo alor" or something, some words, I don't know what they mean. Then someone came into our room and was talking about coffee. We said that we'd like to go get a cup and she said "well, I already made it for you, it's right here." She handed me a cup and it was hot and the top felt like the bottom and so I turned it upside down and that top felt like the bottom too, and I thought I was going to spill it, that there must have been a lid on it so I turned it over again and felt it and there was this flat disc that was there instead of the top. I asked what it was there for, "to keep the heat in?" And she said, "no, it's to muddy it up a little bit." I tasted it and it was okay but there were some coffee grinds in it. Then there was no longer a woman there but a man and he said "well we put onion in the coffee and it makes it taste better." And I was tasting it and it did taste pretty good. Then I thought, I should turn on my radio and tune across the FM band and see what the local stations and programs are like. Then we were thinking about going on a tour somewhere and we asked the woman if there were any tourist attractions that we can walk to from here. Its funny, I never did hear anyone with a British accent, they all sounded like Americans, even when I was tuning around on the radio. (419 words)

We were on a trip somewhere, had been down south and were on our way back and somehow we stopped at a rest area and I ended up talking to somebody on the phone for a long time that we had met earlier on our trip in another state I think, it might have been Ohio, I don't know what state we were in at this rest stop but I remember thinking that I had to get off the phone and use the bathroom and get a Coke so I told the person I had to go and would talk to him another time.

I was sitting on the porch with my wife and son and my wife said "This is going to be my last smoke, I am not going to smoke anymore after this. I'm quitting after this one." Then we were talking about cancer and why smoking is bad for you. Then she lit up another one and said "This one is going to be my last one." Then the scene switched, and we were inside some kind of church and somebody, a young girl perhaps, was up front talking about "since God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son" and was trying to explain something about John 3:16. But I was trying to explain something totally different to my son, just sitting there talking right out loud, thinking I should really be quiet because we're disrupting the service, but we went right on with our conversation anyway.

My daughter called home to tell us that our son had spent 100 dollars yesterday that he'd gotten from selling a snake that he'd owned. He actually had owned a snake and it had just been sold, he was supposed to go out and get the money yesterday and in the dream she said that he had spent the hundred dollars because he didn't want to give it to us. And I was saying "what in the world did he spend that much money on? Was it drugs or what was it?" And she said she didn't know. (98 words)

I was in my office and I was going to go to lunch, walking over toward the coat rack I remembered saying "I think I'm going to blow the rest of this day off." One of my co-workers was kidding me and she said "I heard that!" Then I was supposed to go to a meeting the Cleveland Blind Association and I went to the coat rack and I couldn't find my coat. I was feeling all the different coats, even reached into the pocket of one of them which felt similar to mine, and I found a bunch of balled up papers and different things and I realized that it wasn't my coat. I had to go through the whole coat rack one coat after another until I found mine. They all seemed to feel the same and I had a cab waiting for me so I was really in a hurry to go. I finally did find it, it was way over on the right hand end of the coat rack, probably took five minutes to go through all of the coats [That has never happened to me, I can usually reach right over and feel the texture of my coat.] So I went downstairs and I remember thinking "Oh, at least the cab is coming right here for me I don't have to walk a couple blocks to meet it." The next thing I knew, I was at the Blind Association and I walked in. I couldn't remember exactly which way to go. The more I thought about it the more it seemed like the school for blind children that I went to as a kid, than the blind association. But I got there and was walking and one of the women who worked there was kind of helping me and she said "now we turn to the right here" then she grabbed me and said "its very narrow here" she thought I was going to bump into something. Then we ended up in a big open reception area in the front and again I was waiting for this cab. I don't know how I got to the Blind association but she said, I was right next to this big window in the front of the place, she said "sit here in this prom chair" and I said "boy, I bet I'm less nervous today then when I went to the prom." Then we started talking about the prom and I said that neither of my kids had ever gone to the prom. I remember going to the bath room and then coming out and they said, "Your cab was here but he didn't want to wait so he went to have lunch at the restaurant next door and he'll be back to pick you up." So I waited about 15 or 20 minutes and he never did come back to pick me up. (468 words)

There were a lot of my relatives at my house from Alabama, including my little nieces, one of whom is 10 years old. We were in the living room and it was early in the morning and she was looking at some novel that she had seen at her mother's house. She asked me who it belonged to, I said I didn't know. I don't remember the name 9of it I had never heard of it. But we were talking and the television was on real low, the stereo was also on low and the radio9 was on in the kitchen. They were all on different stations. We were just talking and I got up to check the mail and as I was reaching into the mail box, someone from across the street said "Hello" and I answered him and then I realized that he wasn't talking to me and I thought "Boy that happens so often. Its so embarrassing to answer and yet you have to answer when you think someone is talking to you. I had some really clear feelings and thoughts about that. Them I got back in and realized there was a napkin stuck to the front of my pants and I thought "Oh boy, I hope nobody noticed that." Then I was talking to my niece and she said something about cutting the grass or raking the leaves or something. I said "well, do you do that at home?" and she said "yeah" and I said, "well if you want to do that here I'll pay you, I'll give you a thousand dollars if you want it just to go out and cut the grass and clean up the yard a little bit." Then we laughed. (291 words)

Then I dreamed that I was at this school for blind children, sitting on this lawn swing, where I went to school as a kid and was talking to a bunch of guys and women who were on the swing with me. There was one across the way from me who was debating whether or not she wanted to stay at this place. It may have been a camp for the blind which I visited years ago. Anyway, she was trying to decide and she knew her boyfriend was going to be there. Then she was sitting close beside me and I put my arm around her shoulders and I thought "boy, I hope this guy doesn't notice this because he's really going to be upset, but this woman is just so nice, I like the idea of having her close to me and I spoke to her and said "you're going to stay here" and she said "I haven't decided" and I said "nope, I've decided for you. You are going to stay here." And I made an announcement to the rest of the group: "This woman is going to stay here for the week, because she wants to, but I have made her mind up for her." I was just squeezing her with my arm around her shoulders, thinking how nice she felt and how upset this guy was going to be when he got there. Then he got there and he wasn't upset. And we were talking and laughing and just sort of carrying on. (258 words)

I dreamed that a couple was involved in some kind of sexual activity and part of it involved going to this hotel bar where we are and having a couple of drinks really fast just to heighten their excitement. They were evidently sexually involved publicly. I'm not sure what they were doing but you could hear them laughing and carrying on. Part of this whole process was they insisted, that I have to have a drink, and I said "I don't drink, I'll have a Coke" and the guy at the bar said here, I'll give you just what they ordered for you and I tasted it and it was just straight whiskey on the rocks and I thought "Boy, this really tastes good, and I don't care if I don't drink or if 'm an alcoholic, I'm going to drink this stuff anyway. Then I was walking back to my room, tasting my drink thinking "Man the aroma and the flavor of this stuff is just great! I've missed this for a long time." (175 words)

One more short dream. I was on a boat, I guess I was in the Navy. I was riding on this ship and suddenly it became nothing more that a life raft , a little inner tube or something, and I was out in the ocean with some guys and we were carrying on, they were sort of tipping me to get me wet. I was thinking "This thing really holds me up well", I'm not a good swimmer by the way, but I thought this was great. I was able to navigate by kicking my feet, could get around where I wanted to and so on. At one point, I think my wife was there. I said "boy its good that you're here. I don't know where I am, if I'm in the middle of the ocean or where I am." But we swam to shore and I could hear the surf coming in, but it was very mild, no big waves or anything, just real calm and comfortable and I was just enjoying it out there. We were swimming into shore that's the last I remember. (188 words)

I was in my grandfather's house in Alabama, and for some reason I was sleeping there. First I think my wife and I were sleeping in a bed in a bedroom there. Then I remember getting a phone call from some guy about a job I had offered, and it was 10:30 at night. I picked up the phone and said "well usually I don't take calls at this time of night, I was asleep." He was very insistent that I had to talk to him and I said "Call me back Monday morning, this can wait." Next I remember, I was sleeping on a table, lying on my stomach, with my legs on the ground and my head and chest, lying on this table in a kitchen. It was my grandfather's kitchen. He was there and my step-grandmother was there I think, and my mother was over to the left of me talking about cooking breakfast and she said "well, I'm just afraid to cook on this old stove, I'm afraid that I might do something to it, its so old." Then I said "Maybe I should go into the bedroom and sleep" and my grandfather said "well there's no bed in there we never put a bed in there." And I said "well yes there is." And he started to get upset and argue with me and I said "Come on with me and I'll show you there's a bed in there!" He followed me in and he saw it and just immediately went out of the room and said that his step son must have put the bed in there without his permission and got upset about it. Then we were back in the kitchen and we were sitting there and there was a little boy there, I don't know who it was. I could hear someone calling him from outside and somebody said "there's your fifta pappy. Your fifth of pappy's calling you." And he said "okay" and I said "What in the world is 'fifta'?" and he said "Oh, its a little store like a 7-11. Its a little store down the road." I could hear someone calling the boy and I thought "well isn't that nice, they have little stores like that, just a nice little neighborhood." [Grandpa has been dead for 15 years.] (383 words)

I was looking at an old manual typewriter and it wasn't working right and I turned it upside-down to put a new ribbon in. I know that's not how you put a ribbon in but that's what I did, I turned it upside-down and could feel the ribbon in there. I followed the route of it so I could tell which way it goes and I thought I'd be able to put the new one in. Then I took it out and I found this little round cylinder like cartridge and it was empty I said "Yep, you can tell the ribbon's gone, because the cartridge is empty." So I got the new one and started trying to put it in, but I never was able to get it in, right, I kept routing it in incorrectly and it seemed longer than it was supposed to be and I just couldn't get it to go in right.

Then I thought I was in an elevator lobby at work, standing, listening to some people talk. Then I recognized my female friend S's voice from New Jersey. She was saying that it costs $6000 dollars per semester to send her son to school. Someone else said "Boy, how do you come up with that much money?" And I just chimed in "Well S is rich and I'm rich too, sometimes I borrow money from her, some-times she borrows money from me, we have lots of it." (146 words)

I was back there using my computer and I was in Windows and all of a sudden I got a message through my speech synthesizer that said "fire inside computer" and I went over to P and I said "Hey P, you better take a look at this thing I think its on fire." She looked at it and she said "You're right, it is." But there was a computer program that had a little woman in there and she went and found the fire and put it out with a little fire extinguisher. A couple of minutes later I asked P if it was still on fire and she said "No, she put it out immediately. A couple of times it's flared up but as soon as I see it, the little woman also sees it and puts it out." And I just thought that's amazing! And I thought I wish that I'd backed up my data better because if this fire did a lot of damage in there then I'm going to lose all of that information. (213 words)

I was walking down the street with a couple of friends. There was some confusion over who one of the persons was. I thought it was a friend named Skippy and another time I thought it was a friend named KH. They're guys from when I was a teenager. At one point it was definitely Skippy and he kept making comments, making too much noise and I was afraid that we were going to get into trouble. It was the middle of the night and we were out walking. I threatened him that if he did it again that he would be in trouble and he did and so I started beating him. I grabbed him, started slapping him and hitting him as hard as I could, and I just kept it up and kept it up. And I kept asking him to apologize and he wouldn't so I kept beating him. Suddenly I heard him passing gas and he said "oh, I'm shitting all over myself" and I thought "I've gone too far, I've either killed him or done brain damage or something." So I stopped and I ran with the other kids, whoever it was with us, and the next thing I knew, we were inside the kid's apartment but the kid was no longer Skippy, but was a kid named KH. We were in the apartment and I remember thinking "Boy, this place is really sleazy, I don't like it here at all." KH wasn't there and we were really worried about what had happened to him. I didn't know if he had died or if the police had picked him up or what happened. Then for some reason I went in to take a shower and the place was really a pit. The tub was small, and instead of being rectangular the way they usually are, it was really high but it was square. It wasn't very big, I remember climbing up to get into it and the tub kind of moved and I thought "Man, this place just isn't put together very well. I had a hard time getting the curtain closed, and I got shampoo all over my head and the water pressure was so minimal, I could hardly rinse out the shampoo or get my head washed. I was in a hurry and this KH's dad, who I remember as a kid as a real pervert came in and was talking to me and I thought "This guy's going to rape me or something, I've got to get out of here." And he said something like "there's water coming out, you better turn the shower off." And I did, I got out and the next thing I knew, I was outside walking with my son and we had a summons that we had to appear in court that afternoon. I'm not sure what it was for, it had something to do with this incident from the night before I think. It was on really slimy paper, slimy and greasy, like it had Crisco or something all over it. I remember running it under some water and thinking I hope I don't ruin the paper, but I have to get some of this slime off here so I can read it and I had somebody trying to read it for me and that's where the dream ended.

Somebody came in and brought a pistol and said: "Now that you have this job that you have, you're going to have to carry this pistol and I'm going to have to teach you how to use it, and I want to teach you all the safety features, teach you how to carry it properly and teach you how to get it out quickly in case you need it because you know that that could happen."

I didn't get anything for the 20 dollars, I just left it there. Then I took this lady's left arm and started walking with her, which is something I never do, unless I have no choice, I always take their right arm with my left arm. But I took the left side and remembered wondering why I had done it. Then we went up and sat down in the classroom. (130 words)

My wife and I were separated and had been for about 6 months and I had to go to our old house to do something and I know that will be uncomfortable. We still get along and everything but its going to feel so strange going there since we're not together anymore. The next thing I remember was being at my in-laws' house with my wife and was in their yard trying to retrieve 2 garbage cans that belong to us. One of them had a lot of garbage in it and was fairly heavy, the other one was empty and I went up into the yard to get the one and I ended up getting in between a bunch of hedges and flower beds and couldn't find my way back out and I had to ask for help. My brother in law Moe, who doesn't live with his wife anymore, in fact lives in another town, was there and he was directing me, telling me where to put my feet without trampling the hedges to get the garbage cans out of there and I ended up spilling all of the garbage out of the full one and I knew that I would have to ask him to help me pick up the garbage.

I was really concerned, I didn't know if I liked the guy. I didn't know if all my clothes were going to fit, I started to put my clothes away in the closet and I said: "Are your clothes way over here on the right hand side?" He said "No, mine are all the way over on the left." So I moved everything over to the left and started to hang my clothes up. There was a knock at the door and I went to open the door and there was somebody's guide dog there instead of a person and I thought that was strange, I wonder how it knocked.

I quit shortly after the dream and felt good about the decision. (111 words)

Something to do with a piano. Had to be moved from one area to another and it seemed as if it was upstairs. I could feel my body pushing against it on a ramp and there may have been a hoist involved. The way the dream went, I'm not sure, the way the piano went, it was just messed up. It seemed as if I could feel that it was warm out. (135 words)

Later I dreamed that I was in a car, in the back seat and the car swerved around a large curve or a corner and to the left almost to where I had to lay down in the seat. I don't remember anyone else but me and the driver who were in the car. It didn't seem like anything of significance, the tires squealed...that's it for today. (107 words)

I had a dream about 4 to 6 o'clock. It seemed that there was a group of us and people staying at our house here, there were numerous voices. They stayed here and then we took a trip, it seemed like it was up in the Boston area. Its unclear why we did it and everything, but people stayed the night and seemed to be having a real good time and everything and uh, Gee we had plenty to eat...I don't remember cooking anything, we had something to do with a huge clock, it seemed like nothing I have in real life, we went up in this huge bus, I could feel the spaciousness, like a moving room and I could feel the seats by sitting on them or touching. On the bus there seemed to be food and somebody forgot something back here and it seemed like we had to come back. One of those dreams that you didn't want to have end really. I don't remember too many details there, but it was a pretty neat dream, I enjoyed it. It seemed like my father was in this dream and he was much younger than he is now. A lady from our church, KD was driving the bus. I still can't come up with why we were going or what we were doing, we were going to Boston. (230 words)
Blind dreamers (M):#113-06 

I just woke up from a very strange dream. One of the strangest that I've ever had in my life I think. We were somewhere, like part of my mind says it was part of the grounds of the Redwood school and something else says we were somewhere visiting. I guess there was a great many people around and there was seemed like there were lots of activities around everywhere. And the animals, there were a lot of animals around, like there was a circus there. And the elephant was there of course being at a circus, and we had to walk through the feeding area of this elephant and they were saying "That's all right, you can wash off your shoes because the area was...they said that the elephants were eating something like butter, or mashed potatoes and gravy...But you knew while you were walking that you were walking in this really slippery kind of stuff that was a type of thing that you just knew that you had to get your shoes cleaned and they said, "don't worry about it" and we walked for quite a while in this mess and when we came out of it I heard the elephant making that sound, that trumpeting. It didn't seem to bother anybody, it was just there and there was a lot of activity around and it seemed like there was music in the background and everything but I guess the strangest thing about the dream was where we had to walk and it was almost as if we had to walk through some of the waste materials too that the elephant would leave.

I checked the kick plate along the bottom of the refrigerator. Dreamed that the left side of the kickplate was broken and was hanging by a thread and to the point that it couldn't be put on. In reality it is breaking and I have a replacement downstairs to use when it does break. It was so vivid. I pictured myself in our kitchen looking at the kickplate, that is examining it by touch, and the piece was just hanging by a piece of plastic. It was very real. One of the most real dreams I remember having. Nothing was out of place. (103 words)
Blind dreamers (M):#113-09 

Very little activity...I dreamed that I was downstairs working on the computer, looking at different discs that would be used in DOS, listening to them through a speaking modem.

I had a dream where there were about 8 of us at the house and we were eating, seemingly picnic style. I remember the taste and the smell of the food. Some of us were eating inside and some outside. We have no facilities for eating outside and so they were just eating on the steps, sitting wherever they can, just milling around eating their food. And Mary and I were the only ones who were blind. I think our friend H was here and it seemed like we were going to some kind of meeting or party afterward. And it was something to do with travel, verbally planning a trip or something. That's pretty vague, but mainly I remember everybody being here seems like people just kind of drifted away. It started out vividly and then it just kind of went off into some kind of oblivion. We were supposed to go somewhere after we ate. (157 words)
Blind dreamers (M):#113-11 

I was a witness at the birth of a child. It didn't seem like a hospital, it just seemed like we were in some big room, had to be a delivery room by all practical purposes but it really wasn't I guess. I was allowed to touch the baby as it was coming into the world. I don't know who the lady was and I can't remember anymore. The baby cried and they had me give it a little bit of a spank and it cried and I woke up. This dream was triggered by listening to Rush Limbaugh who was discussing this abortion thing (105 words)
Blind dreamers (M):#113-12 

There were a lot of people. There are a lot of people in my dreams. In this case we were sitting at this very very very large table, something vast like 20 feet in diameter or bigger. All these people were sitting around this big round table. I knew that it was round because it was rough around the edges like the bottoms of our chairs, the new chairs that we got and it was very thick and it was like the people were...there was no arguing, there was no...they were just sitting there not really doing anything, nothing ever came to pass. There seemed to be no purpose for the people sitting there and yet I can remember the vastness of the table. I almost think that they weren't sitting as much as they were just...suspended at the table. It felt like we were sitting, but the more I think about it the more I think that the chairs were almost suspended, they were kind of floating. My weight didn't feel like it was pressing on the chair but the people were just kind of talking, but there was nothing resolved or purpose to be there. (197 words)
Blind dreamers (M):#113-13 

I was in a van, I don't know who else was there. On the back of the seat where there sometimes are places to put things...This was much bigger than you have in reality because this would just take up too much room. There were a whole bunch of books in there...This book had something to do with health and I also think it had something to do with life in general, politics, whatever, the more I think about it , the more I think it might have been "The way things ought to be" by Rush Limbaugh and I remember taking it out and the weirdest thing was that parts of it was in Braille and parts of it were on tape. Because I could remember feeling the Braille and hearing the tape, in the back of this van...whose van I didn't know and who is driving I don't know...but there I was with this book. (157 words)
Blind dreamers (M):#113-14 

I also had another dream and its very vague. Just before I woke up its now 5:00+. I dreamed that there were a lot of cylinders, long cylinders around. The image of these was 4 to 6 feet long, maybe 4 to 6 inches in diameter, maybe a little smaller. They were laying on the ground and I could bend down and feel them. And I could feel them rolling around underfoot I know there s a whole lotta stuff regarding those cylinders. They were various lengths and I remember just that they were very annoying, it was very annoying being around them. (103 words)

I was out in a field, possibly 1977, a lot of grass around and there were a lot of dogs in the area and there was a pile of stones around like somebody moved in and was building a road, not too large stones. I remember picking up the stones and just hurling them violently at these dogs, making every attempt to kill them and feeling very good about it and the dogs were barking. I cannot remember them trying to come after me. Especially this one dog, and from his bark it seemed like a very big dog, a big bark, but it stayed its distance and I must have hit it which I could do only with luck in real life. They didn't run away from the stones that I was pelting them with. I'm not particularly a dog lover but I certainly wouldn't want to harm the animal. (151 words)

Plane crash. I remember being inside this plane and the feeling of acceleration and the feeling of everything associated with the way planes fly...My total fear came later when I was with these strange people. It seemed as if I was the only one among these strangers. Mary wasn't here and it seems no matter how hard I try I couldn't find any familiar people on the plane. There we were flying along, way up there at 30 or 40,000 feet wherever they fly and I knew that plane was going down. I felt the plane lurch and there were strange noises and the plane tipped at about a 60 degree angle down into the earth, I could feel the pressure on my head and neck and the pressure of my head just being pushed into my body, and my body being pressed forward against the seat belt. And I could remember saying "I guess we'll see you later! See you in the next world!" and that was the end of it. The reality of that dream lives with me today and I get little shivers when I think about that dream I could hear the people's voices and screams when the plane tipped up that way. (207 words)

We were only in bed about 15 minutes when I had this dream that an oil tank somewhere was going to blow up. I just knew it! That's the dream where Mary says that I woke up and started shouting: "The oil tanks going to explode!" I remember being around where there was a lot of dirt, we were outside and why I knew that it was going to explode, I don't know. It was warm outside and I felt the dirt. The violence of that dream sent me into a really frightened state. The oil tank never exploded and the plane never crashed and I don't know if the dogs ever died. (113 words)

In bed, I was with my father, I could picture sitting with him in the front seat of his 1987 Dodge 600 and we were going along and he said: "My God I can see the funnel!" A tornado was coming. I said "oh boy!" And we just drive right into it and all of a sudden we're picked up and we're driving and we're spinning around in the air. We're just spinning and spinning and spinning like a top, but still we're able to propel ourselves forward and when the tornado goes away, we're set down just as nice as you please and we're able to keep right on driving. Just as if nothing has happened. (117 words)

We were at camp Harkness. We had an absolutely wicked, violent thunder storm, one of the worse I can remember being at camp, at 2 or 3 in the morning. I was awaked by a tremendous peal of thunder. I dreamed that the walls of the cabin were falling in on us. I was screaming in my sleep (according to witnesses) for everyone to get up and wake up and get out of the cabin because the walls were falling in. And no one wanted to go out in the rain. I remember trying to hold up the walls with my hands, but it was only the thunder making me dream that way I guess. (115 words)

It felt like we were flying in this plane, seems like there were a lot of people around, by the sound. The plane had to land, and it landed right in our living room. I Guess it was flying up around the ceiling. You need room to fly to move a plane around and so the pilot just took it outside and landed it but I don't know where it landed. It tried to land somewhere downstairs (in the living room). (81 words)

My mother and father in law and Mary and I went up to our friend C who lives in Arlington Mass. So we brought him down here and he had some business cards that went into a notebook. I could feel that one part of the business card was raised so that it looked like a separate little part, but it was raised like a little book and you could flip some lose parts of that card, and it went onto the ring of the notebook. Sitting there, and it took no time to get from his house to our house over on H drive. My father in law was helping C get these cards into this book. During this time, my mother in law called the Hs, J and G and asked them to come over and have some coffee with us. I woke up after the phone call, never found out if they came or not. Why C would have business cards, and a business card holder like the one that Mary gave me for my little wedding thing. I don't know. (184 words)

Mary and I were somewhere. We had to fill out these forms, it had something to do with getting into a place or something. There were a lot of people around whom I cannot identify but we could hear them or occasionally brush into one. It seems as if the forms were something which we should have filled out before we got there. Apparently everyone there had to fill out these forms and before we could get there to this place, it might have been summer, it was warm out, may have had something to do with camp. There were 20 or 30 pages to fill out. There seemed to be a lot of trees around. I know I had 3 or 4 more dreams but they were all mixed up. (131 words)

Dreamt that we were in this old store and there were no elevators. There were old stairs, winding stairs to go to different levels in the store. All the floors were wood and the stairs were rickety and very very steep. I could feel the shakiness and hear them creaking. I knew if anyone fell it would be dangerous because the stairs were very onerous. I went down into what seemed like a sub basement, the railings were rough and loose, and there was a lady there who used to help us her name was V. She was with me in the dream, helping us as she always did. It seemed that we looked at a lot of clothes, a lot of different things. I'm thinking that it might have been an old Sears store, of yesteryear. Nothing looked new. The clothes were on these racks that felt wooden, everything was an old style store. And then we walked up and out and when we got up these winding stairs on the street level, the dream just faded away...I don't remember buying anything. It seemed we were there for a very long time. Mary was there and those ominous stairs. (200 words)

I guess its supposed to talk or beep. It was like I had taken it to a store, taking it to Tweeters etc. to look at some VCRs there. (68 words)

Same day I was wearing a ring that you almost wouldn't wear because it had all these points all around it and it was rough and very tight. Almost not round on the outside, more square or rectangular. It may be something that happened in the old store of the other dream. (52 words)

We were living in Hartford, and I dreamed that somehow I got shot in the arm. When I woke up, it took about 20 minutes to get over it, it seemed so real to me. I remember my left arm hurting and the hole that the bullet made in my left arm, on the side, near the shoulder. I woke up and my wife had to tell me over and over that it didn't happen and I could still feel the pain and the hole in my arm. (88 words)

I was walking along this road and there were a lot of leaves on the road and suddenly there was a cool, damp night, I remember that it had been raining and afterwards I decided to go out for a walk for some reason I could smell the night air and the leaves and then all of a sudden I woke up, back in the house. The house was part of the house I live in now, because I remember the dining room table, sitting in the kitchen and I remember that suddenly the house changed and it was the house I had previously lived in and there was all kinds of stuff that was in that house that should have been in that house, but the floor and the walls, that I actually touched, were of the house where I am living in now. And I said that we'd have to remodel it to look like the other house and I remember actually starting to take the walls down. (170 words)

I was out on a lake in a boat fishing with my father in law and there were other people there too. They were all friends that I had from when I lived back in West Boston where I haven't lived for 10 or 11 years. The mix of the people confused me and I was trying to figure out from them how they got out in the boat and how I got out in the boat and I actually remember touching the boat, and it was his boat, his aluminum boat but the weirdest thing was that there were all of these people around and we were catching fish.

We were getting ready for my daughter's wedding and we were setting up chairs. The dream was short, it was mainly going out and borrowing chairs and tables from all our friends and relatives. And I could feel the chairs, some were made out of wood, some were metal folding chairs, some were plastic and the thing that bothered me was somebody told me the chairs didn't match. Their colors didn't match and some were made out of wood some made out of metal and plastic and I remember running around trying to find a matched bunch of chairs and while we were unloading them, that's when I woke up.

We were in this crowded room and it was very noisy and we were trying to find the door, trying to get out of there. There were a lot of people around, they were all, some were clapping, some were cheering and apparently it was at a concert. I must have dreamed about the concert because my son had been mentioning a couple of concerts in a row, and there was all this loud music and noise and I was trying to find the door and every wall that I came up to was just a wall and there was no door and I just kept going around in circles, around in circles and finally a security guard said "if you want to go out you have to climb out of the window." I remember trying to climb out of the window and I couldn't get out the window because the window was shut and I had to force the window open and I remember feeling the glass and the metal structure around the window. I finally got out and was walking down the road and I people were yelling and telling me I had to come back and because I paid for the tickets I would have to stay for the whole thing . It was really weird. Just as they were about to approach me, I woke up. (230 words)

A fairly real dream about the wedding, sort of a reenactment of the whole day that went on. We had a wedding in a church, it was not a big church but I can remember walking my daughter down the aisle and going to the ceremony and then we jumped to the reception which was outside in the back yard. I remember there was a wooden bridge in the back yard and I remember walking over the wooden bridge to go to a table to sit down and I remember cutting the cake and dancing with my daughter and I remember eating and all around me I could sense that it was a beautiful, sun shiny day and not too hot. I dreamed it exactly as it took place that day. It was very late by the time we left. It was a very realistic, vivid dream. (147 words)

I remember dreaming of some of the stuff that happened to me while I was in the hospital recently. I dreamed of the tubes that were down my throat for breathing. I remember the tubes vividly, I believe they were made out of plastic and I remember it being taped to the side of my face. I couldn't yell and I couldn't talk I couldn't really do anything. My left arm had a restraint strap on so I wouldn't pull the tube out. I also dreamed that they took the strap off and they left it off for about 2 days I guess and finally I did pull the tube out myself and the funny part was that they did leave the restraint off and as I awoke, I did pull the tube out. The dreams that I've had lately are mostly about my time in the hospital. (148 words)

I was going to the store to buy bread, and I went next door across the parking lot and I remember the sun, it was a hot, sunny day and the humidity was relatively high and when I got there, the door wouldn't open, it was stuck and I thought "oh well, they must be closed." I started to walk away and then someone opened the door from the inside and said "Oh no, we're open, come on in." So I went in and I couldn't find anything that was familiar to me, the whole place had been rearranged, there was hardware up front and I thought I must be in the wrong store but yet I could smell bread being made and I said to the guy, "Where's the bread being made?" And the man said "You're in a paint store." I started to leave and as I did someone came up and started to ring up their purchase and I could hear them say you have milk, eggs and 2 loaves of bread, and as I started to wake up I wondered how they were able to get bread when I couldn't.

Dreamt we went to an amusement park as a matter of fact it was Six Flags and I remember hearing all the noise of the amusement park, touching the actual rides that I went on, they were metal and I could remember the seats, and we went on quite a few rides and I recall getting off the rides and they were really intense rides, they went up and down and all around the way rides do and I remember looking for my son and I couldn't find him for 2 or 3 hours. There was nothing wrong with him, he was off riding some other rides and I could hear him at a distance but every time I caught up to him I couldn't find him, he wasn't there. It was pretty weird. The next thing I remember was getting into the car and just slowly driving back home. (150 words)

I remember playing cards with Claudia and our youngest son, but the funny thing was all the cards were in print and he had to read the cards to us and he of course won almost every game. We were teasing him, accusing him of cheating. He got rather annoyed at that and threw all the cards on the floor. And just as I yelled at him that he'd have to pick them all up I woke up. (78 words)

This dream had more reality about it than anything else because what I dreamt about was our daughter having her first baby, our first grandchild, and I can remember going to the hospital with her and we stayed a while and then my oldest son, Elroy left and came home with me and I remember waiting quite a while for the phone call saying that she had had the baby. Just like in real life, we received the phone call, left the house going down there, walking into the room and seeing the baby, holding the baby, it was a wonderful experience. (102 words)

I dreamt of a job I had, years and years and years ago. I was working in a factory, making gears for printing press machines, which is what I did years ago. I can remember loading the machine, and these gears were made out of brass and I remember putting the gears on and these gears made a real mess because you didn't use oil on them to make them, they were just there to dry. I remember starting the machine and saying "something's wrong, the oil pump's not on." So I turned the oil pump on and what a mess that made! We had oil and brass chips all over the place and I remember having to get all the equipment out of there and having to clean it all up. Finally, as I began to wake up I remember thinking, wondering how did this bed get there, and because the window was open, how did all these sounds get there and it was pretty confusing for about 2 or 3 minutes.

I am attending a business conference in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and walk out of meeting in a hotel and into a sort of large cafeteria where many people are eating in wide open space. The food table contains some sort of delicious looking apple cobbler mixture. I walk behind counter and start serving people as they come to table. The cook is seated near me--also behind serving table--and he is eating voraciously. I am nervous for fear the inviting apple mixture will be gone before I can get any. Later, in hotel lobby, I see Steve Andrews (fellow Manager in my office) get off elevator. I walk up and mention that I left the meeting to go home. Also tell him about the great apple mixture in the hotel restaurant. We stroll into a small waiting area and sit down. I am in a small, uncomfortable, old-fashioned brown chair close to ground, and Steve is in a normal and comfortable chair. I am squirming, trying to get in a good position and envying Steve his much better chair. (177 words)

I am in a large room with many people, some soldiers, all strangers, and am attempting to buy a painting from a soldier.

I am aboard a ship. The admiral is a disgusting, somewhat filthy old man who approaches me and I show him my teeth, partial dentures. Someone puts the teeth in the admiral's mouth and I say, "You have to have places empty between certain teeth so the plates will fit." But the teeth strangely enough fit his mouth and he looks a lot better. Later, still on the ship, I see him dressed as a woman. I am completely amazed, since I know it is the admiral, yet now he is thinner and beautiful. His wrists, I note, are thin and clean and his hair is quite stylish. In fact, he is the center of attraction among the passengers. I can't believe it is the same person. (127 words)

I am sitting at a table with several albums of stamps which I have taken out of the UN Postal Administration and from my safety deposit box. There is another guy at table (a stranger) and he too is looking thru his albums and talking aloud, His talking annoys me. And then as look thru my album, I am more annoyed at noting certain stamps are gone, others cut out from page. On the first pages I only noted some perforations bent and thought this was my carelessness in handling the book. Then seeing some gone and later see that these are all the most valuable, I am incensed. Rush home to phone Bob Max (Chief of UN Postal Admin.). I can't find phone book, but eventually get thru, and start to tell him what happened. He, however, is calm and not excited and this annoys me. We are cut off and then I hear children's voices on wire. I say, "Some damn brat cut us off!" Then I regret saying this because it was probably Max's kid and maybe they heard me. His wife comes on and tells me BOB IS NOT THERE, BUT AT THE UN. I am quite puzzled by this since I was talking to him. I then tell her that I am disgusted and will no longer collect stamps and will resign from all the clubs. (231 words)

I walk into a supermarket and am wearing women's flat shoes and aware of the noise they are making on the hard floor and it embarrasses me that this calls attention to me. I note several women standing nearby watching me and looking at my feet. A bit beyond them I continue shopping very busily and wonder if it would be best to just continue on and all the way around the store to the exit or return and go past these same women. Later have gone up some stairs and first person I see is one of the same women. (All strangers) (103 words)

Am on a 'round the world trip and visiting Australia, where a busload of us have stopped to play baseball. I am last in line to bat and when my turn comes, I suddenly note the bus has gone. Looked for some familiar faces, but only found the stewardess. I was furious at being left behind. Later am in a hotel and same girl (a stranger) is there and I ask her when next plane is due since mine had left and could I continue the tour on next plane. Am dissatisfied with answer and I tell her I am so disgusted I want to go back home. The hotel is big, but seems very junky. I walk around the grounds to kill time and see a guy wearing a sleeveless tunic and a floppy hat. Later see some guy in a hotel room (different man, both strangers) and I ask him where I can get a tunic. He replies that it is made of sheep, like the one he is wearing, which is slightly different, but has long strands of hair. We walk into another room and then I am in my own room and see in mirror that I am wearing earrings. Am astonished and then realize the guy probably saw them but said nothing. Room is very disorderly and I decide to write a nasty letter about this to Pan Am. I go to an office of my company and ask everyone for some paper. No one has any. One offers me a tiny slip of paper. Every piece I pick up from a desk has something printed on one side. I am thoroughly disgusted and storm out to another building looking for the head office where am sure there will be paper for the letter. I find a paper store in the street and also realize at the same time that all I have with me is US money. The thought also strikes me that I was stupid not to have asked for paper at the hotel where there would surely be some. (347 words)

Am at some international sporting event. Gen De Gaulle is there and I watch him playing ping pong and wonder what he is doing there. Walk around outside the stadium and note everything, house, very honky tonk. I enter one and see a French movie star sleeping and awaken him. Then I ask someone to recall his name for me. I wonder why De Gaulle has not congratulated him. Walk to a table where De Gaulle is drinking a glass with some colored liquid. He mutters something about it being only a colored soft drink and that there should be more acceptable stuff around. He also mentions that the French Red Cross has labs there. He is at a large table with several people planning to enter a billiard game or something similar. Few minutes later he is gone and someone says he left in a huff. Later I see a man and a woman waiting nervously at an elevator. The man resembles De Gaulle but he could also be just a double. I hear someone say he is not De Gaulle, but that the General is out sitting on a bench with a girl. (195 words)

Am waiting on tables in a large dining room where I seem to be only waiter. People are mostly all waiting for service, few eating; few with any dinnerware in front of them. I go to kitchen and no one is there and don't seem to see any dinnerware around. A couple enters dining room and I seat them and ask for their order. Couple is familiar to me, but can't recall their names. The man asks for a "gasket" for breakfast and says it is a sort of melon. This puzzles me. I return to kitchen and look for plates and cups for water. Finally see kitchen has an immense variety of shelves of all sizes, containing all kinds of dinnerware in disarray. I determine place needs organization and cleaning up. I prepare a tray with some cups of water for the couple and take to them. In placing down some spills and realize this is a fine way to start the service.

Am walking down a street and pass a couple, middle-aged, woman dumpy and with red, fuzzy hair. Suddenly she leaves her partner and comes over and propositions me. I look at her and say that I would never believe she was that way. Later am sitting at a table with 3 or 4 persons eating. To my right is the same woman sitting, oddly enough, in what appears to be a row of movie seats. I whisper to the guy across from me so she cannot hear, that in case he didn't know it, that woman there was a "prostituée" and I spell it out after saying the word. (109 words)

I see some brown chickens running around the yard and decide to scoop one up and so do using a butterfly net. Finally get one and then I smash the net on the ground a few times to either kill or stun it. I stop and then see it is really a brown red fox and not a chicken. I empty the net and it falls on the ground, stunned. I grab a club and beat it unmercifully ... many blows. It seems to take much time and the fox appears to be looking at me and pleading for mercy. At one point its claw raises and seems to be staying my blow as it touches my arm. But eventually I beat it to death. (125 words)

Am walking down a street behind two boys and note that one on left has his hair rolled up on curlers at the bottom, below his cap. I think it strange for a boy to have such long hair. In striding past them, I glance quickly aside at his face and then note he is wearing a skirt and he is really a girl. Later I enter a house and two Scottish girls that I apparently know well are sitting in the kitchen at a table with their mother. They appear to be visiting and this is my house. A fourth woman is also in the kitchen and apparently she is my mother. They are all laughing. I ask if they are telling unclean stories. I then am glad as I shake hands with them, that I am wearing my favorite tartan tie. Then look down at it and note I don't have it on, but instead am wearing an orange turtle neck and no tie.

Then see a strong stream of water shoot into windows and note it seems to come from a light brown pistol which doesn't seem attached to any pump. I marvel at the force of water from such a small pistol and watch as the stream goes thru window and plays up and down and at shelves and furniture. Also note there doesn't seem to be any fire in room. (87 words)

I am in some sort of institution or home for people with sex troubles. Looking in a mirror I note that the lacy upper part of a slip is partly seen in the V-neck of a black shirt I am wearing. Say to myself: "Why not, everyone knows I am supposed to be a man who wears women's clothes. So what!" Later I appear to be wearing a skirt with same black shirt and hear someone say that it is afternoon tea time. A woman with a large oven opens the door and I see little cakes inside. She says to be careful, they are hot. I take a brown one that appears to be gingerbread, but I wonder what is inside. While taking it on a paper doily, I note some chocolate balls about 1" in diameter on a nearby shelf and when the woman turns her back, I take some. Look for a table and all are full. But someone at a table invites me to sit down. I sit and feel good because I remembered to smooth my skirt properly. Later a woman from the institution, some sort of warder, takes 2 or 3 of us on a bus. I sit down alone at an aisle window, conscious of being dressed completely as a woman and with a neatly coiffed hairpiece. I look at arms in the sleeveless dress and observe they are too muscular looking. Some young boys enter the bus and apparently know the warder. They sit in back with her and are all laughing and joking. One is apparently sitting behind me and I feel a rake-like stick poke me under the rear and I jump with a slight protest. Then one of the young boys sits down alongside me. I see he carries a new, coiled bull whip. He turns to me and I note his shirt is open and I poke him away and off the seat with a small stick which I push against his chest. He leaves, saying, "I'll get you later." I hear someone else, one of the girls, jump in indignation and I guess someone has also poked her with the rake stick. Later we are in a bar. I see the warder and the boys and some other people sitting up to the bar. I walk past and sit down at an empty table in what I feel is ladylike fashion, smoothing my skirt. A boy approaches me with a mean look on his face and I begin to realize that the warder has set this whole thing up to allow myself and the other girls to fall into the hands of these bad boys ... and that the bus meeting was prearranged. I am afraid because I do not want to be touched by them or even worse, to be whipped and get hurt seriously. I get up and look for a toilet. Remember saying to someone that I had better use the men's room. Enter and note people staring at me. I enter an open booth, fumble thru dress, slip and corset and finally find my penis. I urinate standing over the bowl and immediately it fills up as my loud, strong and very yellow stream pours down. It flows onto the floor from a bidet which seems strangely connected to the toilet bowl. A janitor walks in and ignores me as he reaches up and pulls a chain. I walk out and adjust my dress.

Am in the recreation room of some shore resort hotel. Note a young couple seated with knees touching and supporting some sort of game board. I take a chair nearby and watch. On the board are numerous small objects, such as a pin, pencil, piece of chalk and object of game seems to be to place them like dominoes in some sort of order, either from most expensive to least expensive, or vice-versa I leave and walk outside. I see a hotel nearby which is shaped exactly like a large can placed on its side. It's some three or four stories high. I am afraid it might slip any minute and actually roll on down the beach and into the water. It occurs to me that only those lying in the sand sun bathing would be safe, providing that their position coincides with the large rectangular openings of the can-shaped hotel as it rolled over the sand, crushing people. Later I hear the hotel actually did roll down onto the beach. (171 words)

Am in Stockholm on business and decide to take a trolley car to a store with the name of Batlle. Conductor says fare is 50 cents and I ask him if he said 50 cents or 15 cents. He mumbles something that sounds like maybe 50 cents, but I decide he really means 15 cents. I put a nickel and a dime in the fare box. At Batlle the clerk shows me a solid-looking 35mm viewfinder type camera. Price is $31. I look at camera and tell him it appears to be just what I need for my daughter. He leaves and I examine camera, but the more I look at it, the less satisfactory it appears. There are bright blue and red labels and a roll of film with instruction sheet how to put in camera. But the sheet comes apart and case doesn't seem to fit. I assume it is a display camera and the clerk left to get me a better one. I wait a long time and he still doesn't return. (175 words)

While standing in doorway of my garage I note a squirrel has invaded the garden. Reach for my German slingshot and grab a pebble. The pebble seems more a stone, but I think it will probably just pass thru the uprights of the metal slingshot. I look for squirrel and it is now sitting in a bush. As I aim, one of the metal uprights slowly bends towards me. Astonished, I straighten it up with my right hand and again take aim. As I pull back the elastic, again the same metal bar slowly bends down. I look for the squirrel and he is gone. (105 words)

I am in a bus station and looking at a posted map of routes. A woman and a little girl are standing next to me. The girl opens her hand and it has a penny. I do the same and I also have a penny in my hand, but mine seems bigger than hers. I give it to her. Then her mother smiles and asks me what bus I am looking for. I tell her I want to go to Westwood or South City. She says those cities are not located where I am looking, which is in N.J., but rather are to the east of N.Y. and she points to where I thought Long Island was and it does say N.J. I am truly puzzled but I realize the map must be correct. (134 words)

I am in a house on a high and steep hillside and observing some animals, strange-looking beasts, all lurking around the base of a tree. Next morning I look out the window and down to the tree and it is gone. But I see another a short way off, but am sure that it is a new tree, one I didn't notice the evening before. I see a strange new bird fly away from it, but as it gets closer, I am disappointed to note it is a rather common species of butterfly. (93 words)

I am in Paris and strolling around looking for familiar streets. Recognize as few as well as some shops I know. Then I feel I should be doing something more worthwhile with my time and remember there is an Alexander Calder exhibition at the edge of the city. Go there and see some 60 pieces of large sculpture standing against the walls of a chateau. I think to myself how nice it would be if my wife were there to see this tremendous exhibition. (84 words)

Am in a bed outdoors in a garden and the bed is at the corner where two eight-foot wide paths meet at a right angle. Before going to sleep I see some flowers alongside one of the paths and realize how pleasant it will be to see these again when I awaken. Then realize winter is coming and they will be gone. Awaken on a sunny morning and find I am wearing a black corsolette and I immediately start to unclasp it since it is clasped all the way down the front. I do this as I am lying on top of the bed and without blankets. Then see a girl strolling along quietly sniffing flowers. I quickly pull my knees up and close to stomach so she won't see what I am wearing. She passes and says, "Good Morning." I respond and she disappears down the other path. I relax and start again to unclasp when someone, a stranger, comes strolling from other direction. And I hear footsteps from the direction the girl came. Realize with all these people I'll never be able to get the corsolette off and out of bed. (193 words)

I have a new sports car and keep it in a garage where apparently I told the owner he could borrow it. Arrive at garage one morning and note the owner's mechanics are testing it with all kinds of modern equipment. I realize ruefully that he would probably never have done that for me, but is doing it since he intends to borrow it. However, I drive the car out and am heading toward a traffic light when two trucks roar by me, one on each side, and the one on the left cuts over in front of me. I am incensed at their beating me to the light and I wish they were not there. As I do so, they both start to roll backward to another traffic light and I arrive at the second light and am happy I am in front and they are back and waiting at the previous light. As I am waiting alone at the second light for it to change, all of a sudden the concrete highway under me begins to move backwards and under me like a treadmill and I say, "Oh! they're changing the road again," as though this was a normal everyday thing.

Am in a garden and trying to reach something in a tree. A picnic table bench is under the tree and on top is the step ladder, with the step legs precariously close to edge of bench, whereas thinner legs are in a solid position. I am hesitant about climbing up this ladder. A man is holding the ladder and encouraging me to go ahead. The man is N.Y. Gov. Rockefeller. He calls to two men who were watching us and one steps forward and sits on bench under ladder to support it. (93 words)

A German officer is walking toward me and for some reason I don't want him to see me, and I crouch down in a large armchair so my head doesn't show. Then he sees me and shouts something. I realize I am wearing pajamas and a blue bathrobe and he must have spotted me quickly. I follow him and my feet, which are bare, hurt from walking on the stones. We enter a building. He disappears and I see a man looking at a picture of clouds. The drawing also shows some of the buildings on New York City's 53rd St. and I walk up to him and tell him that the street is 53rd. He nods and smiles and says nothing, and I realize he probably only speaks German. (130 words)

I am a spy and have crossed the German lines and made contact with a German soldier. He invites me to conceal myself in the bushes where I find a row set up of movie seats in violet color. We sit in the seats and both look up at a large mountain not too far away. He says, "See all those French soldiers up there." I can see hundreds of them in the distance silhouetted against the sky. They look like ants and as numerous. I think to myself how easily someone could pick them off with a high powered rifle. (101 words)

My wife is trying to reach a ship out in the harbor. She jumps into the water fully clothed and wearing her new gray winter coat. She swims steadily toward boat as I run along the shore shouting encouragement, knowing she is not a good swimmer. I am extremely nervous for fear she will not make it. Others also are in the water swimming toward the boat. She continues to swim fairly strongly and eventually is out of sight and I know she has reached the boat. (87 words)

I am driving alone along a parkway trying to locate a certain intersection. Several cars are in right lane, but I manage to edge in as we approach an intersection. I keep looking for large signs describing the intersection and see nothing, only small street-type signs which I cannot read. I am annoyed and drive past intersection in disgust. Later I stop while driving on a long, narrow street and ask a man for the route to Panama. He has a shopping cart of groceries and says he'll show me the way if I take him and his cart. I have a small green car and open the trunk, but it is full of packages. We think about putting the cart and contents through a door, but do not actually do it. Later am in a small restaurant in which I think is Mexico. A small boy is with me as a guide. He has gone to eat, sitting at another table with friends, while I eat alone. I finish and am impatient for him to complete his meal so we can leave. He finishes, but then leans back to relax and chat. I realize that this Latin relaxing is not for me and decide to get up and walk out and surely he will then follow me. Then realize as I reach the outside that I don't have the car keys and have left them in my shirt pocket. Rush back into restaurant and find shirt on back of a chair and am relieved to find keys haven't been stolen. Later am at home and packing for a trip to Latin America. I intend to drive there and just continue on and on with no definite destination, but just to drive along and enjoy the sight. Take a khaki blanket from a closet in case have to sleep in car. Also pick up a pair of rubbers in case of tropical rains. I think about supper and note time is 3:15 and decide I must be on my way by 3:30. Then I realize I cannot really go on the trip and leave my two daughters alone since they are still going to school. They need me and I must abandon the trip. Also am aware that Nancy is 20 and Katie is 6 and that the former should be able to carry on in my absence. But I still decide to cancel the trip. (406 words)

I am in a hotel where I am supposed to dance in the female impersonator show. Am dressed in full women's underclothes, but no dress, and am wondering why no one has given me a fancy gown for the revue. Someone hands me some material and at first it appears to be just folded remnant of cloth of a greenish gold color, but attractive, with a small print design. As I unfold it, I see it has short sleeves and is long, but needs ironing or pressing. I go to a hotel room where I know there are two irons. As I walk in, notice someone is using the smaller of the two and ironing on a blanket on a table. I turn to the other side of room where I know there is a normal ironing board, but then see someone also using that. I am impatient to get dressed and eventually am wearing the dress and realize that the show is starting. I look at wrist watch and time is 10:25 pm and know show starts at 10:30. I am in a panic. This is my first show and I must be on time. But my face is not made up and I know it takes much time to apply theatrical makeup properly. I ask someone to get my little white box with makeup. Later I am in an elevator, still dressed but without makeup, and people are looking at me strangely. I think surely they must realize I am in the impersonator revue. (256 words)

Am driving a busload of people who have paid for a tourist travel trip to a southern state. We arrive at the state line where I am stopped for a traffic light. Also realize that I am not familiar with the traffic regulations of that state. I look up at light and there are no colors, then look again and it is green. We continue down the road and then later someone else, a young man in dark purple shirt and matching trousers, is driving us, but the front of the bus inside seems more like a trolley car and he is manipulating the lever as we continue along. He drives up and down the hills and I note they are getting steeper and steeper. Finally in desperation he turns to me as we climb a hill and says he is using all the speed he can get and that we are just about able to make the hill. If they get worse, we won't make it. Ahead I see several grades, but they are small. We reach a plateau and in the distance to the left of the road we see some majestic mountains in the distance. They are misty and the sky is blue and the sun is strong. I realize the rugged mountains are the Rockies and also that I didn't know this southern state was so far to the West. We continue and finally the road ahead narrows until there is only one lane. Our vehicle fills the whole road. Ahead I see that the road swerves, has dangerous turns and then finally unbelievably, it actually turns on its side perpendicular. When I see that, I am furious because the state trooper had not warned us that the road was so bad. I realize we will have to go back and that the tourists will get a refund. I wait at the side of the road as the man in purple shirt walks ahead to see how the road looks. Then a sports car comes by and roars ahead and sweeps around the perpendicular road and is gone.

Am in France and going someplace with George Mohr. We approach two curved lines of yellow taxis. One contains normal sized cabs; the others are mostly small station wagon type of delivery cars, typical to the kind used in Paris. George heads toward the smaller cabs and I try to say something to him about using the larger, more comfortable ones. The driver of the first small yellow cab nods as we approach and I decide I don't like his looks. Then George says that we forgot to tell the kids we were leaving and abruptly we turn toward the left to a few buildings like camp recreation buildings. George calls to the young people who can be seen playing in the large building. He calls in English and I then say something in French and immediately they all come out. One small girl runs to me and throws her arms around my legs and clings to me. George continues talking to them in French. (165 words)

Am in some strange small town in the mountains and as I look up, I see someone skiing down a long and narrow run on a hill far away. I am with someone, but cannot recall his or her face. We start walking up toward the ski area which seems far away, but we finally reach an open square or plaza covered with a few inches only of snow. Just then a skier, a young boy, comes across the square fairly fast, heading for the corner where there is a sharp right angle turn which then leads down a narrow ski run. He doesn't make the turn successfully and crashes into the fence. Not too hard; gets up and shakes off the snow. I note he is using old wooden skis and wonder whether I would risk my own metal Hart skis on such a dangerous turn and on snow that is not packed. (154 words)

I am driving someplace and looking for a certain road. I see one at the left with a house on the corner. Am not certain it is really a road or just someone's driveway, although it is rather wide for a driveway. It is black asphalted and I stop the car just after the turn, undecided whether to go ahead or not. The road disappears into the trees and a short distance ahead a man is standing square in the middle of the road and looking ahead at me. I sit in the car and wait and he stands and watches. No action. Finally he moves a few steps aside and I drive ahead. As I pass him, note he is middle-aged, heavy-set. I drive on and on and finally into an open area. To the left the view is magnificent of a bridge in the distance and a bright blue harbor. Later I am on a boat in that harbor steering it thru the water and appear to be very high up in the boat. Have a good view of rocks and shoals as the boat is steered by me along the coastline for some distance. The water is a deep, rich and clear blue and I remark on how much fun it is to steer the boat so easily thru the water. (224 words)

President Lyndon Johnson made a speech on TV and apparently I must have missed his talk. Someone has asked me to get a lot of copies. I ask a store and their price is $89 for 12 copies and I cannot calculate the per speech price and this annoys me. I wonder why they cannot arrange to have the fire bells or horns ring for a few minutes with some special signal that would alert the public to the fact that the Pres. is going on TV. (87 words)

I have moved into an apartment on the top floor of a building in some large city, As I walk into the apartment I hear much noise from the next apartment and note that there is a glass pane door separating my apartment from the adjacent. Most panes of the window are covered with brown paper, but here and there it is torn and I can see a family next door sitting at the dinner table and eating and conversing noisily. I note two little girls in dark green dresses and with light brown hair eating in the seats right next to the glass door, where the table is located. I am annoyed at this noise and lack of privacy and immediately start to place pieces of brown sticking paper on the open spots on the door. After this I look out of window at other side of room, which gives a splendid view out over a very large city. In order to see directly down, I remove the screen, which is an old-fashioned type held on with two flanges at the top. The screen slips off the flanges and I hold it tightly and try to get it back on the hooks ... without falling out the window. Slowly and carefully I get it back on and then close and lock it. Later walk downstairs and in lobby of apartment house see some Chinese people and I feel friendly with them. I see a man who is the janitor and owner and with him is his Chinese wife. I offer to help him sweep a huge red tiled lobby area and I tell him that my wife also is Chinese. All three of us - janitor, his Chinese wife and I - sweep a section of the floor with straw brooms. It occurs to me that he really needs some large foxtail push brooms in order to do a more thorough job, and thus make less dust. (328 words)

Am in a business office where another chap and I are helping the former occupant to move out his stuff. Apparently I am to be the new occupant. One side of office contains many walnut shelves and drawers and we are looking thru them as the former occupant stands aside and observes. We check shelves to see if everything is packed. While reaching into deep lower shelves near floor, I find a stack of papers and without bringing them entirely out into open, I bend down and examine them. They appear to be personal letters on pink paper and while shuffling thru them, I see a $1 bill. I then slip out the stack and surreptitiously place them in the back of a drawer where I know no one will find them so that I can later examine them in detail when I am the sole occupant in office. I do this switch of location quickly and former occupant doesn't see anything. While checking other drawers, we find two long, slender and very shallow drawers near the bottom of the drawer section. At first they look like part of the structure and not drawers. But we manage to pull them out, the other man and I (not the former occupant) and we see they contain art supplies, ink and brushes, tubes of paint, all of which probably date back to some other former occupant of that office of some years ago. Apparently he had forgotten them. (246 words)

Am in a rented car and stop in a city street and park. Walk past an open store and see piles of cartons containing junk apparently and I walk in and start rummaging thru. Find old clothes and papers and at the same time a woman is looking thru the same carton. We speak in Spanish. I then note at the other side of room a meeting of men from my office. This is a meeting which I had declined to attend, saying I was much too busy. They look at me and wonder what I am doing there with the cartons. I walk past them, saying nothing, and look at my watch as though I was late for something. It says 10 pm, almost, and I reach for a phone to call home. Find the phone, but the receiver is at the end of a long wire and hidden behind some other cartons. I go into another office and it apparently belongs to a church. There are women and children in the room waiting for a minister. I don't phone, but walk out to car which I find parked off the street and on an asphalted lot. I swing into traffic just as light changes, cutting off other cars and manage to get to my lane and speed off. (220 words)

I am driving my blue MG down a street in St. Petersburg, Fla. Someone has said there is a job open at Sears and I am trying to get there. Ahead of me are some soldiers marching and I put on the brakes, but slip toward them and actually bump slightly several men in the back rank. But they don't seem to mind and just turn and look at me slightly. Then I drive on and we all reach a cross street at the same time and must wait. For some reason I am squatting alongside the front rank and looking ahead and then I drop a handful of dust alongside a soldier and it gets into his eye. I quickly apologize and get in car and drive on. (129 words)

I am walking down a New York City street. Day is sunny and hot. Have to wait for traffic at a cross street and a taxi crosses in front of me. It is yellow and has its door on driver's side all the way open and bent forward and tied down. This leaves the driver fully exposed. He is about 45, thin and disheveled and looks at me with a bored expression as he drives in front. The door, unfortunately, extends out in front of cab and thus is quite dangerous. This annoys me and I want to shout something at the driver. But I don't and I continue walking down the street. (113 words)

I walk into a washroom in the basement of a large building. The floor is covered with soap foam and it is piled like snow in a sink. I wash my hands in empty sink and when I press automatic soap plunger, a hissing stream of soap foam shoots out and dowses my suit. I move aside, but clothes are covered with foam, which I try to wipe off as two plumbers walk in. I tell them about defective soap plunger. They walk over and try and again it shoots a stream out about ten feet long right across the room. I jump aside. (104 words)

He stops in front of me and I look up and realize he is threatening me with hand in jacket pocket which appears to hold a gun. I then realize I have seen him before and with another man. As I realize this, I stand up and am immediately aware of that other man now standing behind me, also threatening with hand in pocket. I walk away and then they follow closely behind. I turn quickly and grab both their pockets, one with each hand and twist them away so they cannot shoot at me. (112 words)

I am leaving a building, walking towards the door; it seems to be some sort of school. See an envelope on a table near door and it seems to have stamps inside, so I pick up to examine. A stamp collector I know, Gus, walks over and takes it from me. He pulls out stamps and they are all good items. He walks away with the envelope, saying it was his and he had lost it. Walking out double glass doors, I see on steps some UN stamps laid out on a black paper. All are used and sloppily mounted. I stop and pick up the only possible item of valuable content, a special UN souvenir sheet. It looks okay, but when I turn it over, it has tiny round perforations on back forming small stamp-like rectangles. All of which ruins its value. (143 words)

A man is riding around in a red Thunderbird, apparently looking for an enemy who lives in New York City. He has the address written down on a piece of paper. With him is a little girl and he is anxious for her safety. It is nighttime. He stops near a house and places her in a crate standing up high near a window and hidden. On other side of window one can see another little girl sleeping. She is about same age and sleeps on her back and is wearing a false nose. The man drives away and tries to remember the address. He takes long knife from seat and places in pocket and also puts a long bayonet-like tool in his belt. Then fishes out piece of paper and looks at address. Sees that it is East and he is heading in wrong direction. He turns into an apartment-hotel driveway and turns around, heading East. Next the two girls are seen inside the house, the one who was sleeping leading the other thru the rooms. (177 words)

Later I am drinking it at window and the cart nurse walks in. I say, "I don't hear your bell way back here." She goes to a nearby bulletin board as another nurse, heavy and severe, approaches and says roughly, "Drink your coffee!" I ignore her and continue talking to the one at the board, repeating what I said earlier just to annoy the bossy nurse. I also add that next time I would like her to bring me a piece of chocolate cake and an orange. (117 words)

Have answered a test in a magazine on recognizing religious subjects, art and design. The magazine invites participants to an evening meeting. I decide to go to design group and when arrive and sit down, realize with disappointment I am in the religious subject group. I must have made a mistake, and then decide to stay until they serve coffee. I am sitting partially behind woman whose hair is neatly wrapped in a chignon of braids in the back. The hair is dark brown and as I admire its beauty, she gets up and turns to leave, and I realize with disappointment her hair in front is short and blonde and stringy. I look at her carefully to be sure she is same person. Later am in art group and as arrive there to sit down, I realize am still wearing my hat. I nonchalantly take it off and toss onto top of coat rack nearby. It rolls across other hats and falls on floor. I pick up and place on table near my seat. We are then asked to go to tables in back of room. I find myself sitting next to an old man. I want to ask him why we are at the tables. But as look at him, realize he has a rather stupid face and I get up from my seat. At another table is a slide projector and I see a slide in it of a black and orange drawing. In front of machine is a questionnaire with five questions on it. The slide flashes on a screen and I realize I am expected to fill out questionnaire. (274 words)

He goes to a shelf and puts one down, with a look at the third man, sitting to my right and across. I immediately get up and walk over to shelf where he put the wafer and I eat a mouthful with a look of assurance at the third man. I smile assuredness that I will leave some for him. I munch less than half the wafer and then walk over and hand the remaining morsel to him. (99 words)

I enter the exit door of a red brick grammar school and sit on the hall steps. See a small child's penknife on step and pick it up and then cannot decide whether to leave or walk thru the school. I hesitate, but don't want to be found sitting on steps, so get up and walk down the corridor. In an open area I see 10-12 women sitting on chairs waiting. As I reach them, one looks up at my hair and then I realize with a shock that I have clips and pins in my hair and am wearing a bouffant night cap. Walk quickly to a dim area of corridor and quickly remove the items. I walk into a library area where there is an exhibit of work by children. One is on the subject of trees and I sit down to admire it. A woman, probably a teacher, walks over and hands me a notice about the exhibit and assumes I want to meet the child responsible. I say Yes and he comes over and I tell him that I had heard about him from his mother who comes to the school each day to look at his empty desk where he used to be. We both agree this is absurd. I look at each tree exhibit and they are well executed. Some are carvings, some show age of trees from slices, and I enjoy exhibit and keep saying it is very well made. (247 words)

I am with someone, not a stranger, but apparently someone with whom I work, and we are standing in the street at night and looking at up a new, large office building. it is immense and has maybe fifty windows along one side of a floor. Only a few lights show, and here and there one sees a secretary working. I distinctly note one blonde with a reddish blouse at a brightly lit window, typing. Someone makes a remark about the girls having always to work late, although the boss has gone home. Later I am in a suite of offices apparently soon to be occupied by my own firm. Most of the floors are still empty of furniture. I am standing in a shadow next to a closet inside one of the offices and am dressed in a blue seersucker skirt and jacket. The main door down the hall opens and in comes a firm official and with a guy I know. They walk away and I am relieved ... but then the guy turns and says he wants to see what his new office looks like. I then realize as he heads towards my direction that maybe I am in that office. I quickly tear down the skirt and fumble for my trousers. Then his steps pass the office and I realize that he won't see me. He and his boss are also wearing seersucker men's summer suits of same bluish color as my women's suit. (248 words)

I climb aboard a bus, a long luxurious travel cruiser, and look for the most comfortable seat. Find one with a long space in front for legs and I flop down. No one else seems to be coming aboard. I then hear a noise and note we are parked near a railroad track and a train--a long freight train of yellow fruit cars--is coming around the curve of tracks and the curve is so arched that the bus can be hit. Then it is jarred by the roaring train and the upper outside corner near track is smashed by train. But this doesn't bother me. I remain comfortably seated and waiting as damaged bus remains in position. (117 words)

I am approaching the door of our house ... although it seems a strangely short front door -- and I see a rodent dash inside the partially ajar opening. I dash after and am sure I can see him inside up and close to the ceiling. I run up steps and look back at sill above door. There is a squirrel crouched in fear. I look for a tool to kill him, and pick a ½" diameter steel bar with a point, sort of a star chisel. I jump for him and he lands on landing near front door (inside door), where I manage to pin him down with point of tool. But he twists head up to bite and I move away. Door opens and my daughter Nancy is looking out to see what goes on. I yell, "Stupid!" but the squirrel grabs the opportunity and runs inside where my wife is setting the table in dining room. Squirrel lands on a chair and crouches there -- a small, thin pathetic thing. (Dream ends abruptly.) (176 words)

I am somewhere in Florida in a gulf city and trying to reach the beach. Looking at a map, I see that most roads lead toward the water, but that only one or two actually pass over causeways directly to water. Next am in a small boat in one of the bays between the beach keys and the mainland. I drop a flat, yellow plastic box in the water by accident and it sinks. Then boat suddenly touches bottom. A shark flashes by and then turns back and heads for boat. To say the least, I am frightened because boat seems stuck. (102 words)

He walks towards my bunk and I just lie there and hold pillow. As he gets nearer I throw the pillow at him. He ignores, turns and goes back to his bunk. (93 words)

Am in a stamp store waiting in a line of about six people to buy stamps. Appears to be a confused double line and next to me is a small and abnormally fat man, looking extremely uncomfortable. A man standing roughly in front of me appears to be a friend of fat man. The fat one gets annoyed with someone standing behind him and he then passes in front of me and stands with his friend. I feel sorry for the little guy. Later I have only one person in front of me, as a stranger walks in and stands close to front of line, near me, waiting to cut in when merchant and first man are through. This annoys me and I follow the transaction closely so I can cut in and command merchant's attention before stranger cuts in. (140 words)

I am reading a book on college scholarships and it is a mess with many typos and errors. One line of type ends with "icans-" and beginning of next line starts as "Amer". I decide to edit these mistakes, but the light is poor. Walk around looking into rooms and enter one filled with men at desks, all in business suits. A man tells me to go to room #3, but I don't hear him right away. Finally it registers and I say "Sorry!" and go to that room. A man there wants to discuss my qualifications to obtain a scholarship and I start to tell him I didn't come there for that. (113 words)

I go upstairs in our house to look for something in daughter Katie's room. She sleeps in a small bed similar to one she had as a little girl. In another bed, lying on top and fully clothed with head propped on a pillow and sleeping, is a hippie type of about 25, with reddish blond hair, large and fuzzy. I close her closet door and it squeaks. She awakens and smiles at me and I tell her that breakfast is ready, but with a glance at hippie, whisper that there is not much to eat. (96 words)

Some sort of show for children is taking place in our house. I am astonished at so many children in attendance. A crippled boy with one arm is in a basket suspended from the ceiling by an adjustable rope. With his good arm and the stump of the missing arm he skillfully controls the rope and swings back and forth, up and down, over his applauding audience of children. He is marvelous to watch. I leave and go down a sort of hatchway to floor below, using a ladder attached to wall. Some rungs break under my weight. I slip down easily to next rungs and test them with my weight. They seem weak, so I force them and they also break as I land lightly on floor. I then stand aside with regrets at the broken rungs, thinking how difficult it will be for children, especially the cripple, to get down the useless ladder. (155 words)

Some women are in the cellar of our house and I go down and walk into a back area where it seems to be very dusty. Here I see some babies sleeping in cradles and cribs of different sizes. I go up to the women and tell them it is too dirty and point out "tumbleweeds" of dust on floor. They say something about it being safer there and I don't understand what they mean. (75 words)

Am standing on a train or subway platform with my wife. We argue about which is fastest way to get home. We each decide to take his own way. The argument annoys me and I stand some feet apart in anger. A few feet away stands a woman who apparently heard the argument and this too annoys me. Later am in the bow of a boat as it approaches a wharf. I grab a wire and swing around and down onto pier gracefully and then walk fast down the street determined to get home first. (95 words)

Am in a crowded room of some woman's house along with other people, all strangers. Center of floor is piled high with used, old, damaged items, such as furniture, all property apparently of a former occupant. I suggest to a woman that she clean it up and give her a hand. I pick up a small toy, like a child's tank on treads and wind it up and set it on floor where it chugs away towards a man sitting on a carpet. I see two guitars, both broken and useless, but I hand them to some people laughingly telling them to go ahead and play a song. (108 words)

I was in a basement area of the UN Secretariat Building in NYC and looking for the office of the Postal Administration Chief, Tom Dements. Floor looked strange. When reached what I thought was his end of floor, I saw an office that looked like his with door ajar. Saw a girl, possibly his secretary, taking dictation. Looking closer, I saw she was only reading a newspaper and then I realized it was wrong office. Walking farther, I saw #330 on a room and realized this was the third sub-basement and I wanted the second. Kept looking for stairs to ascend to second. Opened a door thinking it led up, but it was a closet or small niche and contained all sorts of electrical equipment hanging on wall. Finally found the stairs at end of hall and with great relief climbed up. (142 words)

I am running for a train or a subway, am not sure which. A long fence runs between the tracks and I realize that I really wanted the train, but that I am on wrong side of fence and cannot get back to train side. I go to the subway station and buy a New York Times. Price is only 5 cents and I wonder why still the old price of years ago. At station I show a letter with an address (have trouble opening the letter) to the change clerk. I get on, but am not sure I am still going in the right direction. (106 words)

I am in a school class where they teach boating. Class is all girls and I am sitting at a desk dressed as a girl. No one seems to notice me or suspect I am not what I seem. Yet I want them to know. Most all are wearing slacks or shorts, but I have a skirt. Then each goes out in her own small sailboat to practice. Alone in my own boat and moving along, and now I realize that at this distance -- and especially with a skirt on -- no one would possibly suspect I am a boy. (101 words)

Am in a department store or supermarket and look at a list of prices and realize they are very high. Approaching an escalator, I see a woman getting on and I rush over to pull her off, shouting, "She's a Russian!" Later am talking to the store manager, who wears a white jacket, and I tell him I saw a Russian. He then replies calmly, "I also am Russian." I look at him in utter astonishment and am embarrassed.

Have arrived at home after an absence of apparently several days on a trip. Hear my wife talking to a woman in another room. Quietly go into bathroom and sit down to defecate. Then flush and realize with horror the water is rising in bowl. It rises fast and then spills over and the floor is covered with yellow urine and water. I decide I must clean up before the wife hears me, and look around for a sponge to soak up and rinse into basin. Then I see a long, probably 14-inch turd, mine, on the floor near the bowl. I realize I must actually pick it up with both hands somehow and get it back into toilet. I also realize if I touch it, I will ejaculate! (129 words)

Am in a large power boat in the South Atlantic. Water is bright green and weather is pleasant and warm. Many people in boat when all of a sudden it accelerates fast and a man standing in the stern, a friend of mine, falls overboard and disappears beneath the surface. I fear for his safety as someone cries out to beware of sharks. I leap to the stern and then see the black fin of a shark speeding fast toward the boat's stern. Then the fin goes below the surface and I distinctly see the shark flash below deep in the clear water. I am greatly frightened for my friend and I hope he has been able to beat off the shark. Then I look straight up to the sky and realize with chagrin that I haven't prayed for him. I cry aloud to God to save my friend and then look down in water. Surface is crowded with bits of seaweed and debris, but I see no evidence of my friend. He doesn't reappear. (175 words)

Am in a supermarket and smoking a big cigar. Everyone looks as I walk by and seems delighted with odor of smoke. One elderly lady in particular looks up as I pass and smiles. I ask clerk for two 20-lb sacks of flour. He loads them on a shopping cart and I note one is leaking badly. He says it is only a small leak and I protest that it is a large leak, and I hold up the one bag which by now is only 1/4th full. He gives me another full bag and I walk towards exit. There is a can of coke in the cart and I am now eating an ice cream cone. Decide to drink the coke and exit from food area with one hand holding the coke can and cone as I swig from a straw, while other hand pulls the cart. (148 words)

I am on a sidewalk watching a newly-constructed street on which at some distance there is a tremendous flood of newly poured cement flowing down the street toward me. I watch, fascinated, at its inexorable movement. The street ends oddly enough at a blank straight concrete wall. When the first creeping fingers of lava-like cement reach the wall, I shout out that it has touched the wall! (67 words)

I have arrived in Paris again, apparently by boat, and am in the Gare St. Lazare or something similar where Le Havre trains arrive. I decide to pick up suitcase later and walk to a nearby stamp store to see what they have. It is a store that I have visited before. Exiting from station I note time is 8:45 a.m., but that the weather is foul, dark and murky and uninviting. I think it odd that it should resemble more closely 5:00 a.m. weather. Return to station and get case and then walk to where I have a car waiting, parked opposite station. Astonished to see my car full of people, sort of dark working class types. I place case in with them and find a spot to sit crammed in rear. A cop taps at window and I lower to see what he wants. Asks how come car parked there and I say it was only for a minute while I got my case and that I had brought the car over with me. He seems astonished that I would bring a car with me. (Car is a small blue Renault.) The guy at wheel drives away and when he turns right instead of left, I realize we will not pass the stamp store. I shout to stop and "get out of my car!" They continue and ignore me. A few feet later we slow down because many people and some cops are crowded on street. I open window and shout "Stop!" and bang my hand on side of car. Car stops as a few police walk over. (Prior to this as we drove away from station I looked around at all other parked cars, thinking I may have actually gotten into wrong car, but I see no other that resembles mine.) I am so annoyed as the cops approach, I cannot think to speak French and keep shouting "STOP!" Next we are all in police station and asked to produce registrations. I do and a cop puts into an open, used envelope and does same for the workers' registration and then walks away into another room. The workers, four or five men, a woman and a small child, sit down and wait patiently. I walk up and down, annoyed at all the waste of time, and keep looking at them. They don't seem to bear any malice toward me and I think this odd. A long time passes and the cops don't take any action, and I am worried that maybe I did take the wrong car. But nothing happens and I continue getting more impatient. (439 words)

Am in bed in a large room with light brown parquet floor. Room seems empty except for the bed. I turn on stomach and look down at floor, and see a large caterpillar crawling by and then a cockroach, plus some other odds and ends of bugs on the parquet. I reach under bed and grab a shoe. It is a woman's shoe and I use the sole to slap down and smash the bugs, one after the other. I turn to other side of bed and there are more. These I also kill. Then I find a pile of women's clothes, probably were under the bed. I get out and sort them on top of bed and note they are of large size, probably would fit me. One is a light blue skirt, size 18 on tag, and the blue wool material seems to have been cut short to make a mini skirt and done in a rough manner with a pair of scissors. While I examine the clothes and feel happy to have found some things I can use, the door springs open and 5 or 6 men come in. They shout for me to get ready; it is time to leave. They apparently are friends, but I hurriedly jump in bed and pull up the bedclothes, since I realize I am wearing a pink nightgown with a white lace collar and it would embarrass me to have them see me. They all leave except for one, and I tell him about the bugs which he sees smashed on the floor near my bed. Then I see a huge caterpillar on the door at end of room and shout for him to kill it. As he goes to door to do that, I use the opportunity to slip the gown over my head and stuff it under the bedclothes along with the other women's clothes I had found, thinking I will come back later for them.

Am with some woman who I apparently know and we are walking to someone's apartment. Arriving there, we pass thru the garden and I note with pleasure the many tall seedlings in boxes and think I may see if I can get some for my house. We climb stairs and a man approaches. I ask for the apartment of Mr. Weiss. He nods consent and opens the door of a nearby apartment. As we walk in, the woman with me giggles and I look at her with distaste. Her profile is strange and I realize she is a stranger. The man who opened door seems to be a janitor or attendant of some sort, but he goes behind a counter and brings out some stamps for sale. Says he will find a nice set of the series I am looking for. I wait and then note he is completely wrong and the 4 or 5 stamps he has placed on the counter are completely different from anything I want and I have a suspicion he knows nothing about the stamps. Meanwhile, 5 or 6 homemakers and their children are standing near doorway and I note they are rather good-looking in an interesting way, and I have a strong desire to walk over and talk with them instead of having to explain to the janitor how wrong he is about the stamps. I am sure he will not understand and a hassle will develop. (243 words)

I walk out of a bar in some foreign city and find my small car half buried in snow. Curiously enough, no snow on top of car, but the vehicle sits in about two feet of snow. I open door and seats are covered with slight layer. This I brush away and then start to rock and push car to get it out of slush and snow, and into the street. This is very difficult, but as it slides into street, other cars are blocked and they sit and wait. Car won't start, so I lift hood. I then slip down on ice and in struggling to get up, see that my trouser knees are soiled from slush. This annoys me and I note with additional annoyance that several dozen cars are all blocked on account of mine. (138 words)

Am in a hospital ward where people are all taking some sort of medicine and most objecting to it. A nurse hands me a glass some 2/3rds full of a watery, bluish liquid like weak milk. I am sort of sitting on very edge of bed and as I put my head back to raise glass and drink, I slip off bed to a standing position. Am aware that one is not permitted to leave bed or touch the floor and I pop quickly back on bed and start drinking again. But I slip again and still haven't tasted the medicine. (101 words)

I enter a bar with a baby who appears to be my granddaughter. A baby high chair with sawed off legs is on the bar surface and I place her in it. Somehow I have a feeling she is my daughter and I her mother. Someone brings dried kidneys and crumbles them in her soup (someone else had previously brought her the soup and she started eating it right away and I was pleased). I protest as this second stranger puts the kidneys in the soup, thinking that now she will not finish the soup ... but she continues to eat and again I feel relieved and pleased. (108 words)

I awaken and look out window and note I forgot to put out garbage cans the evening before. Note that trash baskets of neighbor on left are empty, but here and there across the street I note that a can or basket remains full while others are empty. I cannot tell whether garbage men have passed by yet or not and this is annoying. Then I see 3 or 4 full cans sitting on my driveway and remember that I promised the neighbor on the right that I would put them out during their absence. I think about putting them out even now, but am not sure whether it is too late or not. (114 words)

I ignore it and lean back with hand over eyes as if sleeping, but continue to watch TV thru closed (partially) eyes. Later hear nothing and get up to look out curtain. See a small woman of Latin origin standing at door with small boy. He looks up and sees me peeking out and then quickly pulls sleeve of woman. (90 words)

Am walking down a street with Carl Rider, Editor of a newspaper, and suddenly he puts his hand on my fly. I protest, telling him that they arrest you for that in this city. I relate story of a man who fell down in street and of a chap who walked over and knelt down to help the man up ... and was then arrested by the police. Carl and I stop at a magazine stand and we look at some maps. Later am in my house talking with HH, a well-known stamp dealer, who notices a large calendar on my desk with the number "024" on it. I blush because I realize it is the one I took during a visit to Rider's office. I tell HH it is a duplicate of one in my own office. (138 words)

Am looking for a barrack and keep trying to remember where it is since I am sure I was there once before. Some places look familiar; others don't, and I find myself on a street completely unfamiliar. Go in a police station and there a boy with a map directs me. I leave, but still am not sure I am going in the right direction. (90 words)

Am walking in the corridors of a hospital looking for the exit. Keep trying doors to see if they lead to steps down. No luck. All the walls are newly painted and are a shiny enameled white. There are no direction signs and no numbers or anything on any doors or walls ... just the bright white paint. I wonder why Fire Exit not seen and realize this probably painted over also and this carelessness disturbs me. Now and then pass an alcove and there see a patient or two lying on mattresses on floor and talking to visitors. At end of a long corridor, I am confronted by three or four doors. Open one slightly and see a patient inside and realize there is no exit here. Finally pass an administrative office with cashier's window in wall. A nurse directs me out. (143 words)

I am walking in front of the UN building in NYC and over the inside walkway are three huge billowing balloon-like canvas awnings. They are high and bright red and orange, and I marvel how well they protect the pedestrian and add to the staidness of the UN. I walk into the Delegates' entrance and suddenly realize I am wearing a red and white vertically striped turban-like hat. It is a rather startling item and people all stare. I rather enjoy the attention and feel the hat compliments my new dark cashmere coat. (93 words)

Am walking along an apartment house basement corridor to a room known as the "Doll Room." I have a doll with me and when I reach the room, a woman opens door and lets me in. Walls covered with shelves, all containing dolls. She asks if I have a stand to hold the doll in an upright position. I say no and then leave. Following day am riding a large tri-cycle bike in front of house and pedaling along down a two-foot wide curb on a retaining wall that curves around the apartment house. As wall gets higher and driveway alongside deepens, I stop the bike and jump down from the wall and walk into the same basement corridor as the day before. Go to the doll room, but things have changed and now the door has a number on it like a suite of rooms or an apartment. Also the door alongside has a number. Room I thought was the doll room has a light shining under door. I decide to try the second room, and as I go to knock, the door flings open and the woman standing there seems to know what I want. She points to adjacent door and without saying a word, then closes her door and I remain in corridor still not sure I am in right place. (224 words)

Am standing across the street from the RR station in a group of people I apparently know. We are all observing the passersby on their way to the station, from where they catch the train for the beach. Every few minutes I see someone I know in the crowd going to the station. Finally I count out " ... 10, 11, 12 .... that makes 12 guys I know from our crowd. Guess it's time for me to go to the beach." But I head away from the station and say to someone that I have to change my good trousers to khaki ones before I can go. Strolling up the street, I feel unusually good and strong and healthy and I stretch my arms out to the side and then overhead and exercise as I walk along, now and then swinging my arms. Then I see a girl in a store window rearranging some dummies and I feel sorry that she must work while everyone goes to the beach. (170 words)

Am in a large barn-like structure on the estate of my firm's boss. There are many employees there and we all awaken early for a sort of picnic breakfast to which the boss has invited us and arranged for everything to be prepared. He walks in with his wife and several family members. The women are fashionably dressed, really overdressed and overly made up, and I look at them and suspect they would have all preferred to remain in bed, but that the boss forced them to come.

Am in Florida in a large souvenir store and looking over the toiletries counter. A small tray of perfumes is getting all my attention and I also look at some perfumed soap and bath powders. Then I take a small bottle of something, probably perfume, and fold my hand over it so it is hidden. Continue to look at other things on counter and then slowly saunter toward exit. In meantime have casually transferred bottle to my rear trouser pocket. Then an elderly woman in front of me drops her lipstick on floor and looks at it as I come by. I am not anxious to bend down and pick it up, thinking bottle in pocket may show. But I quickly stoop down in sort of feminine fashion, keeping back straight, retrieve it and give it to woman. Then I walk out of store. (144 words)

Am in Florida walking down a street in St. Pete and apparently carrying some luggage or packages in my hand. Pass a girl going in same direction. We walk together and I tell her there is a good restaurant up ahead on the left. As we walk, some sections of sidewalk ahead seem covered with water, but as we get nearer they are always wet, but not covered. Then suddenly to the right I see a motor yacht heading into the sidewalk. We slow down and then the yacht turns parallel to the sidewalk and parks and I see a fat old man in an armchair on the stern. He looks German. On the door heading into a cabin, I see a German word, like "Schwarzbuch." The girl and I walk on to restaurant, but I am disappointed to see it is no longer there. As we pass under a tree, some water flicks on us as a young guy shakes a branch at us. I ignore him, but he does it twice more. Then I put packages down slowly and grab him and hold him on the ground by forcing his head into the dirt with one hand. With the other, I shake a branch and wet him thoroughly. I release him and the girl and I continue walking. (220 words)

Am in the UN building and I see an inside window display or type of showcase in which there is a card saying something about an exhibit on mankind. Focal point is a tall male mannequin or store dummy dressed in mod clothes: tight gray trousers and shiny long leather boots. The model is exact copy of myself and I realize this was done on purpose. Sort of growing out of one part of the dummy is another head, closely resembling me also. But it is decidedly a feminine head. Exhibit includes statuary of some modern shape, plus photos that I cannot distinguish. A woman approaches me as I am looking at exhibit. She is somewhat mannish, but otherwise attractive, and she says she is Mme. Onantis, the photographer of the exhibit. (It's a name I have never heard before.) I tell her how much I like her work and then we walk out of building. Altho sun is shining, it suddenly rains and we decide to wait under the sheltered doorway.(172 words)

There are four of us at the beginning and we are among Those on Earth. A spirit, a powerful angel, comes for us and we follow her through the air to a room -- is it in the clouds? The room is long and narrow, and we sit at chairs on the same side of a long, narrow table, looking blankly at the Earth somewhere below us. My chair is the left-most one, and I have a vague feeling of loss, a vague sense that the right-most seat of the four is empty. The angel announces, "One of us did not make it, and we know what that means." I do not completely understand the remark. Something about the angel reminds me of my mother. The angel then flies down to sing for Those on Earth. The scene is a rock concert, where the angel is on a stage with microphones. Her audience on Earth is very large, and we can see all of this from our seats in the long, narrow room. It is night time and the angel sings of the stars. I look at the sky and the stars appear beautifully to me. I want to see the stars more closely, so I get up and leave the long, narrow room, a move I am not sure I should be making. Curiosity is stronger than doubt and I do go back to the Earth. When I arrive I find I am a butterfly skipping across a large meadow near a mountain. One of Those on Earth sees me and touches me. It is very painful: my body, my wings, all feel as if on fire! Even the very sky turns red as I am touched, and I yell out a very loud, "Ow!" The person touching me can not hear the yell, and touches me again, apparently trying to catch me as I fly away in hurt. The second touch is just as painful. Altogether I am touched two or three times before escaping. Now I am hiding in the mountains, halfway between Earth and the long, narrow room in the sky. I can not go back to either, and I am now alone. And suddenly I have a great insight: the other from my original group on Earth (the one who did not make it to the right-most seat at the long, narrow table) is a butterfly just like me! The butterflies are the ones who leave boredom looking for beauty. The long, narrow room is a place we must go to when its time has come, but it is also a place we leave when we are ready.

I am on vacation with an unidentified girlfriend at "Disney World", which is really a large skyscraper with many trick staircases, secret passageways, etc. I spy X. (a male friend from college) arriving behind me and we move on. I am hiding from him and eventually escape. I stay one step ahead through the staircases and hide, even as another college friend is sent ahead to "see if I'm there, and to get me to join them." I am clever and successful at hiding, but I can not recall the reason for doing so. (94 words)

A group of friends and I are standing in a long line of people waiting to enter a patriotic shrine or public monument. The group is in a rowdy mood and there is much joking and kidding. As we walk single file through an underground hallway at the entrance we notice that there are signs hanging on the walls spelling out the rules for the monument. They state, "No Smoking", "No Eating", "No Drinking", and so on. When we see a sign that says, "No Onions", everyone laughs at how ridiculous this is. "I guess carrots are okay", I joke sarcastically, "just no onions." Someone ahead in the line calls down, "No salad." "No salad?", I respond. "What about vegetable oil?" "No vegetable oil", comes the reply. Sure enough, just then I pass under a doorway where the two lines "No Salad, No Vegetable Oil" are painted overhead. (148 words)

I am still attending college and my family joins me for a morning awards ceremony at which I am being honored. My brother X. is asked to say a few words, but his speech is lengthy and he makes the ceremony last until 11:45 a.m. Now it is time to pack up all of my things and leave the apartment for the summer. I am passive in this dream. (69 words)

I am from the woods and my pet A. is somehow a deer, not a cat. We export ice from the woods to earn our living, and I am taking part in a large expedition of many woodsmen to make a big ice delivery to the city. A. the deer comes along. I pull by hand a cart filled with large ice blocks along an unpaved, bumpy trail. It is hard work. After passing through a thick wood, A. and I stop in a meadow where I brake the cart so I may rest a few minutes. A. jumps on top of the ice blocks and sits down there. She likes it! More woodsmen pass through the meadow and they think it is humorous to see a deer that likes sitting on ice blocks.

I am the only passenger in a car being driven by X. (a female friend) and we follow a car with Y. and Z. (a married couple) into a large parking lot for a shopping center. As Y. and Z. pull ahead and out of sight, I ask X. to stop the car in front of the first store in the shopping center, which happens to be a Genovese Drug Store. "Can you let me off here?", I ask. "I'm going to be late for work." X. is somewhat surprised by this request and she says, "I didn't know you work here." I answer, "I don't want the others to know. This is a temporary job. I quit my other job." Then I get out of the car and run into the drugstore, barely getting to my position behind the counter before being late. There is a flashback and I am resigning from my old job, which was being a spy for Israeli Intelligence. "Spying is very exciting work", I explain to my superior, "but I can not take it anymore. I want a regular job." The spymaster is very understanding and he graciously allows me to leave the intelligence agency. "Do I know too much?", I wonder to myself, referring to information I have gathered during my career. "Probably not", I conclude. (223 words)

I go ice skating with X. (a female friend). We are both dressed too lightly for the very cold rink and the rented skates don't fit quite right, but I am having fun anyway. (34 words)

X. (a male friend) and I are walking through a public terminal of some kind and it is very crowded as we follow a long line. We are afraid of being caught for something we have done -- what? -- and we are each carrying incriminating pocket-sized pistols. They are loaded, but I am very careful that the trigger on mine is not cocked. There is a security inspection ahead and there is no place to hide the guns. "I'm getting out of here and doing this again", I think. I have some kind of power to go back in time a few hours. The terminal turns out to be an airport, and I go back to the time that my plane is about to land. (Somehow I have now lost X.) This time I am the pilot. I land the plane, and without any announcement, run undetected out of the plane through the indoor gate area of the airport. No one sees me yet and I look for a place to dump the pistol, still concealed in my pants pocket. I find a hedge row of bushes inside the terminal, still unblossomed. I conceal the gun there, hoping it will not be seen. I run through all of the hallways of the airport building, with my "passengers" still waiting on the plane I just landed. I leave the building and run through the parking lot, hoping that I can finally escape. When I reach the spot where I had parked my car, a policeman is standing next to the skeletal remains of a bombed-out automobile. "That's my car!", I cry. "That's my car!" I am very disappointed that now I can not drive away. The main feeling of this dream is of wanting to escape, to go away from the crowd quietly. I am not actually chased, but I run away and am hiding something. (316 words)

I am visiting a museum in a small city located in a vast desert. In the center of a large room stands a dinosaur skeleton which greatly impresses me. "When did people first realize how big dinosaurs were?", I wonder out loud. "It must have been very exciting for the first person who found such large bones!" There is an expert (paleontologist) standing next to me in the museum who replies, "You can see yourself where the bones come from." Upon hearing these words, I run out from the city into an endless desert plain of red-brown sandy soil blown about by a constant wind. Soon I come upon a quarry which is rectangular in shape and perhaps six feet deep. I walk down some steps dug into the ground and look around in the pit. There is a vague awareness of other people in the quarry also looking around. I quickly find some bones lying on the ground, and in the excitement of this discovery, I go running back to the city. I reach a modest ridge just on the outskirts, and get my first clear look at the highly varied architecture of the city, which appears to have grown in my absence. There are buildings in the styles of many ages, and as I leap off the ridge and joyfully bounce from the top of one building to the next, I imagine that I am jumping from century to century. As I jump from the roof of a two-story 18th Century Colonial brick house to the top of a 20th Century glass skyscraper high in the clouds, I wonder, "If only they (the dinosaurs) could see how much we (humans) have accomplished!"

I am riding with my brother X. on a long train which I later realize is the Long Island Railroad. The train is one of the modern, electrified lines and we are moving along quickly. As I peer out the front of our car, I see the car being disconnected. There is a thick cable pulled out of the front of the car, and we are reconnected to another train. Now we are moving much more slowly. I see the train we had been previously connected to now on a parallel track to the right of us, and it passes us. I remark to my brother, "This is as slow as the Port Jefferson line!", referring to an older line with diesel trains. (123 words)

I am among a group of friends at my home having a discussion, and I say something witty (I can not remember what.) To impress them I say, "That's a line from Shakespeare." "Which play?", someone asks. "I don't know", I answer, "but I have his collected works." Next to the table where we are all seated is my bookcase, and I pull down the red-covered volume entitled, "Shakespeare's Collected Works", and begin leafing through the index of quotations. I find a reference to one of the historical plays (which one?) and open to that page. As we read aloud from there, one of the women in the group suggests, "We should try it in a real theater." Somehow we indeed next find ourselves in a real theater with a live audience. All the members of the original group now have copies of the red-covered "Collected Works" to use as scripts, and a few of us, including myself, walk out onto the stage in order to perform from the same page that was read in my home. I begin to read the part named "King" opposite one of my woman friends who reads the part of the "Queen". There is a hub-bub from the audience and we are not being heard well. Another man (a friend of mine?) is now also trying to read the part of the King. Sensing confusion, I ask him softly, "Oh, do you want the part? That's fine.", and I relinquish my role. Seeing that the lines are still being barely heard by the audience, I instruct both he and the Queen, "In Shakespeare, you have to PROJECT." The last word I speak loudly and clearly, and it rings throughout the theater. Murmurs of agreement in the audience follow, and then silence for the first time. I decide that since I no longer have an acting part in the play, I will be the director, and I slip behind a convenient shell on the floor at front center stage. The Queen reads her lines, and then I give a cue to a young girl, maybe eight years old, to read her part, that of a young princess or a magical fairy. Then the King recites some lines to the young girl. Both the audience and I are moved by the performance. (386 words)

A large group of friends -- maybe a dozen or so -- and I enter a pub or inn in a small cottage. The building is very old, and the pub is reminiscent of Medieval England. We seat ourselves in a stuffy room at a long rectangular table made of a very sturdy wood and covered by a thin tablecloth. One end of the table is near a stained-glass window which shines colored light in an otherwise dimly lit environment. In the next room is a kitchen where much cooking is occuring. I have a vague notion of pizzas being prepared for our group as we sit around drinking beers from large mugs and making a lot of noise. Since it is a medieval- style establishment, there are certainly no modern inventions, such as television, around. Someone asks, "Did you bring the TV? You have to bring your own here." Another person produces a portable set and places it on a tall bench near the end of the table. The group goes crazy and starts chanting, "Pella-vision! Pella-vision! Pella-vision!", emphasizing each syllable equally. The word is understood to mean a television brought into the pub by its patrons for the purpose of entertainment. As the dream ends, I am caught up in the frenzy of my friends as we eagerly anticipate watching some program on the tube. (227 words)

I awaken from a nap and reach out to fetch my eyeglasses from a nearby table. Something is wrong with one of the lenses -- the left one. The part of the lens near the nosepiece has become very thin and has begun to peel away as if made of tranparent paper. I touch it there and more of the lens flakes away. Very soon the flaking ceases and about half of the left lens is gone, leaving a large hole in the glass. I put the glasses on my face and think to myself, "It looks like the damage has stopped. At least I can still use them." The dream ends with a feeling of making due with what I have despite setbacks. (124 words)

I look out the big picture window of the living room of my apartment. Directly ahead, standing in a line by the curbside, are four women with balloons. Each woman has two balloons attached to her chest, making it appear as if she has a very large pair of breasts. Upon looking more closely, I see that each balloon is indeed decorated to resemble a naked breast, including a big nipple at the end. One of the women has painted a hideously elaborate set of blue and red blood vessels on her balloons as well. The women are carrying signs and shouting some sort of slogan. I say to myself, "These are feminists protesting something." I go out into the front yard to investigate. There on the lawn is a great commotion: a large number of people are sitting in folding chairs set up everywhere. Many of them are dressed for a political convention, wearing striped jackets with large buttons on the lapel and funny straw hats colored red, white and blue. I am extremely annoyed because these people have occupied my front yard. "Is this a convention organized by my landlord?", I angrily demand aloud. No one pays attention as all interest seems turned towards a rectangular table covered with a white cloth at the center of the yard. I fight my way through the crowd, vowing to find out if my landlord is at the center table. I see a few men wearing formal black suits seated behind the table, but my landlord is not among them.

A game of street baseball is being played, and it is my turn to bat. Among the fielders are two brothers, and I hear someone remark that it is nice to see them together again after a recent reconciliation. The older brother is in his mid-50's with just a few gray hairs, but is in very good physical shape and is quite strong. The younger brother appears to be about 40, has black hair and a moustache, and is easy-going in nature. The brothers are black. The older brother pitches, while the younger one plays the field somewhere near first or second base. The first pitch whizzes by me with incredible speed, stopped behind me by a solid wall of some sort. Unsure of my grip on the bat, I swing wildly, missing the ball by a large margin. "He plays hardball", I say, referring to the pitcher. "He used to be in the majors", someone informs me. A second fastball goes past me just as quickly as the first; I miss again, but this time my swing is a little better. This happens a few more times, each time my swing improving while still missing the ball. The older brother then brusquely announces, "0 for 6, time for the next batter." The younger brother takes offense at this and urges giving me another chance by saying, "He's just getting the hang of it." A brief argument ensues between the two over whether I should continue batting. Each is disgusted with his brother's position, and they turn their backs toward each other and will not speak. Someone says, "This is just like their last argument, and they didn't speak to each other for a long time after that." Attempting the role of peacemaker, I say to both brothers, "C'mon. You have to look for what you have in common." (309 words)

I am in a room looking apprehensively at a blank wall, knowing that something is about to happen. Then I see it and I exclaim, "It's the Blue Hand!" An ethereal, translucent, dark blue right hand, cut off at the wrist, slowly rises up the wall. The hand does not gesture, but is always in an upright position. I find the sight both frightening and intriguing. I dare not approach the wall, yet I want to know more about the hand, suspecting that it wants to tell me something. As the hand reaches the top of the wall, it thins out and then disappears. (104 words)

There is a performance of a musical opera which is set on ships at sea. In the first scene a group of two or three pirates kidnap three young ladies. Further details from the first scene are sketchy. The second scene takes place on the pirate ship, where the three lady hostages have been taken. In this opera, the decks of the ship are represented on stage by large sleeping hammocks. The ladies lie on the lower deck, or hammock, while the pirates are on the upper deck, or hammock. The pirates, singing their lines, decide amongst themselves to tease their captives. They proceed to do this by swinging the lower hammock back and forth in order to make the ladies dizzy. While swinging the hammock, they sing together in a strong clear voice. One of the ladies, however, is not bothered by the hammock swinging and she answers the pirates' song with a clear soprano voice of her own. The pirates sing their song louder, only to have the soprano answer in an aria which grows more and more beautiful, expressing her determination to be heard. (187 words)

I am a crew member aboard the Starship Enterprise featured in the television show, "Star Trek, the Next Generation." I am among a large group sitting around a circular table in the ship's bar/lounge enjoying themselves. One of the crew ("Riker") says, "We have to get back to work now." Everyone at the table, except the Captain ("Picard") and I, gets up and goes off together. Sitting alone with the Captain as he sips his drink, I say, "You know that I have to go with them." The Captain nods his head in an understanding way and says, "Yes, I know." I get up from the table and start backing off, still facing the Captain. Suddenly I am whizzing backwards across the floor at a great speed, as if pulled by some strange force. I speed in this manner out of the bar through a small corrider and into a room where the other crew members from the bar are standing. They are all startled by my entrance, and one of them ("Jordi") says, "He's being pulled by some mysterious force!" There is a set of elevators near the middle of the room, and I zoom directly into an open shaft and fall in. The other crew members are very concerned and look down the shaft to find some trace of me. "It's okay!", one of them exclaims. "His dog is still there!" Sure enough, at the bottom of the elevator shaft my pet dog (a small black terrier) wags his tail and barks to demonstrate that he has taken the fall and is fine. I, too, am fine and am hiding underneath the neighboring elevator. I laugh at the crew who were so worried about me and call up to them, "That was a good trick I played on you, huh?" (302 words)

I am at the arrival area of a large airport going through immigration and customs. An official takes my passport and places it down on a table with many papers as I pass through a gate of some kind, similar to a metal detector. On the other side of the gate I am handed my passport back. I get to my home and ask myself, "Did I check the passport?" I open the blue- covered passport and see inside the name and photograph of a Chinese man. "Oh, no", I think, "they gave me the wrong one." Thinking that I might contact the Chinese man to exchange passports with him, I look through the passport for an address or telephone number. All I can find instead are glossy color pages picturing an item that the Chinese man has brought through customs. The item is a universal exercise machine with weights, pulleys, benches, etc. I become anxious believing that now I will have to go through the bureaucratic procedure of obtaining a new passport.

I am standing on a city sidewalk with X. (a female friend) and we are waiting to meet someone. An older woman dressed in a dark overcoat and a fedora hat approaches us; she is a spy or an agent of some kind who wishes to relay information. She says, "Now I can tell you what I have learned. The secret is . . . ". At the very instant she is about to tell us the secret, a bullet appears out of nowhere and knocks her down, just like a scene out of a cheap detective story. I look out into the street and three taxicabs pull up ominously by the curb where we are standing. The three cabs are painted identically: yellow with a black-and- white checkered trim. Sitting inside are hoodlums or gangsters who are threatening us. "I guess we have to go with them", I say to X. The two of us get into the middle cab and we are taken away. We drive past a corner where a policeman who doesn't seem to notice us is standing. "Just my luck!", I say, "The police don't see you when you need them." After going around the corner, the cab stops, lets me out, and drives off. I am standing in front of a two-story brownstone apartment building. "This is my house!", I say, thinking that I have outwitted my kidnappers. I climb some stairs to the upstairs apartment and enter. The neighbors in the buildings on both sides see me and call out greetings. (258 words)

This dream takes place in a park very reminiscent of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. I am scheduled to give a public lecture outdoors, and an older person, the organizer of the lecture series, tells me to get dressed for the event. I walk off to a secluded part of the park near a fountain and proceed to undress. I am quite embarrassed by this, and hope that nobody sees me. (No one does.) When I remove my underwear, it becomes hopelessly tangled with the new pair of underwear, like two links in a chain. Struggling, I manage to put on the new pair as the old pair hangs at my side. I finish dressing and tuck the old underwear under my shirt, hoping nobody will notice it. I walk over to an area of benches where people are waiting for the lecture to begin. I see X. (a female friend) sitting there and walk up to her. "This is going to be a good lecture", I promise her. (170 words)

X (a former male co-worker) presents me with a greeting card and asks me to read it. I read aloud some printing in English. "No, not that part", X says. "I can read that. Read this part." He points to some handwriting at the top of the card which is in Spanish. I read aloud again, this time translating the Spanish into English for him. (I do not recall what anything on the card actually said, but I do recall that the Spanish section was about one or two sentences of simple words that I could easily recognize.) (98 words)

A group of friends which includes X. and Y. (a married couple), and I are standing around in my living room. There is a pause in the conversation and Y. says, "Everybody! X. has an announcement to make." All eyes turn to X. After hesitating for a second, X. blurts out, "Y. and I are going to have a baby!" I am surprised by the announcement and exclaim, "Oh, I am so happy for you!" I turn to Y., who happens to be standing next to me, and give her a big hug. "This is great news", I say to her and X., but actually I have very mixed feelings. I am concerned that I will be spending less time with my friends and drifting apart from them. (128 words)

My father, my brother X. and I are standing in a line at a bank. My turn comes and I step up to the cashier's window to cash a check. After receiving my money, the teller asks, "Do you want the free coffee with that?" Suprised by this offer, I accept and am handed a coupon. I think to myself, "I wonder what 'coffee' means." I'm then taken (alone) to a big ballroom or dining hall in the back. At the door I'm handed a cup of coffee and a plate of pastries. I walk up to some round tables in the middle of the room and see that there is bread on the tables and that many people are sitting and eating. "Oh, it's a whole Continental breakfast," I say. I look for a place to sit, but the occupied tables are all full. Before sitting down I realize, "The bank is in a hotel." I go back to the cashier window, which is now an ornate desk in the hotel lobby, and see that my father has just gotten some money and is walking away with X. He sees me and says, "Oy, I didn't get a breakfast." From his tone of voice it is clear that he regrets forgetting to ask for his free breakfast. (218 words)

I am lying on the floor of my house next to the fireplace with my calico cat A. Somehow the sliding glass door to the back yard opens up and a black stray cat wanders inside. This cat has a scraggly appearance with unkempt hairs standing out from its body; in general it is ugly. A. sees the other cat and instantly runs toward it. I am quite concerned that the two cats will start fighting, but from my prone position am unable to reach either cat. A. rubs up against the black cat, and they act friendly toward each other. The ugly cat rolls itself up into a smooth black ball and A. rolls herself up into a smooth white ball. The two balls of fur continue rubbing each other and I hear a lot of purring. (138 words)

I look out my living room window at early dawn while it is still somewhat dark both indoors and out and see a man with an animal head facing me head on. I stare at him eye to eye for a few minutes to figure out who he is and what he wants, not sure all the while whether he is able to see me back through the dimly lit glass. The sun comes up and now it is daylight. "He is a masked burglar staking out my house", I think. I run to the door, open it and rush out. The potential burglar sees me coming and runs away across my front lawn and down the street. As he flees I notice that his animal head is an elaborate mask of a wild boar with a lot of hair and a snout nose. There are some children playing on the street, and I warn them, "He is a burglar. Beware of him." (163 words)

I am a traveller carrying one light bag and looking for a place to spend the night. I do not have a lot of money and someone suggests a place. We walk there to discover a hostel of a sort in a large indoor space big enough to house a gymnasium. I find a spot near a corner and prepare for bed. I think to myself, "Luckily I have my high-tech pillow." I take out of my bag a light, flat panel about 8 by 10 inches and the thickness of a thick piece of cardboard. "It works by applying a voltage.", I say. "There's a new kind of material which fluffs up when you apply a voltage." On the face of the panel is a liquid-crystal display with two "buttons", one labelled "on" and one labelled "off". I touch the "on" button with my index finger and the flat panel magically inflates to the dimensions of a fluffy pillow. I lay it down on the ground and comfortably go to sleep. (172 words)

I am floating down a river alone on a small inflatable raft. I lie on my back admiring the scenery on a bright sunny day. Underneath me on the raft are various personal items including towels, shirts, cans of drinks, and a portable radio. As I slowly move from where the river is narrow and thick with vegetation to a wide open stretch, I listen to the radio which is playing a sad Country & Western song about a heart-broken cowboy. The radio is buried in the pile of clothing and is apparently sinking lower and lower into the pile as the music becomes more and more muffled. Nonetheless, I hear the words of the song quite clearly: the song ends with the cowboy telling his former lover, "Maybe tomorrow I'll love again, But I won't be at your door." (140 words)

I am in my office at work with the lights off. Just outside the door there is a party going on in the hallway. Many classmates from college are there loudly talking to each other, apparently ignorant of my presence nearby. "What a coincidence that they have the party so close to my office", I think to myself. Before saying hello, I decide that I will turn on the lights. I flip the switch which normally turns on an overhead fluorescent light, but this doesn't work. Next I try turning on a small lamp on top of a tall file cabinet, but this doesn't work either. With myself still in the dark, X. (a male friend from college) walks into the office and I say, "Oh, hi X." (128 words)

Woody Allen is in Boston at the bar "Cheers" featured on the television show of the same name. I am standing at the bar counter with a group of people who are admiring Mr. Allen from a distance, but who are unable to muster the courage to go up to talk to him. "I'll do it", I say and I walk up to the table where Mr. Allen is seated. I say hello and tell him that I am a great admirer of his. He looks at me blankly as he signs an autograph on a napkin. After that there is a brief pause in the conversation during which I feel upset that our encounter has been merely a shallow exchange of pleasantries. I decide to elevate the intellectual level of the conversation and find out more about the views and opinions of Woody Allen. "What do you think about Ross Perot?", I ask, referring to the undeclared Presidential candidate. Woody Allen's eyes widen with interest when the question is asked, as if he is finding more in me than expected. I await an answer, but I can not recall any more of the dream after this point.

I am reading about a new type of professional soccer league in a color weekly news magazine. There is a description of the game and some of the new teams, including a team named the "Cosmos", which the magazine article says may follow in a "tradition of dynasty by previous teams of the same name in earlier leagues." I find myself at the opening game playing for the "Cosmos". The rules are a bit changed from regular soccer: a center square portion of the field is quite a bit raised in elevation over the rest (i.e., it is not a level playing field.) This center portion is landscaped with bushes and trees, and the rest of the field, which looks like a standard field, is reached by steep ramps. Play begins at the center of the square section. The ball makes its way towards the goal of the opponents of the "Cosmos". I am standing there, and when the ball is nearby I kick it to the goal. I watch almost as if in slow-motion as the opponents' goal-keeper misses. I have scored a goal and everyone in the crowd cheers! Play resumes. I see that several players use their hands in this version of soccer, but I am not sure when this is allowed, so I decide to play as if it were regular soccer. Again I am standing near the opposing goal as the ball comes. I break out of a pack of players to get to the ball and from the right wing position I kick it into the goal. The poor opposing goalkeeper looks overwhelmed as the score goes by him. In an apparently new rule, after the goal is scored the goalkeeper himself kicks out the ball into play (instead of starting at the center of the field.) The opposing team plays sloppily and I quickly get possession of the ball again. I boot it hard directly at the goal and score a third time. The crowd goes wild as I exclaim, "I LOVE this game!" I turn to my brother X., who is one of my "Cosmos" teammates, and confide to him, "Their goalie is not too good; they should get another one." (369 words)

My brother X. and I drive to a beach in the cool autumn. I set up a chair near the roadway and X. wanders a little bit down the sloping beach. He gathers a lot of sand from nearby and builds an elevated walkway leading to the top of a two-story, tall, round castle turret. He sets up his chair there and surveys the entire beach. I am bored with my position and decide to explore. I follow the elevated sand walkway and reach the turret. The view is nice, but there are some large rocks ahead which block the vista of the sea. I leave the smoothly constructed sand castle and climb down onto the rough, jagged rocks. The going is slow but I eventually reach the top of a tall rock right at the water's edge. I look below and see Y. (a female friend from work) swimming in the ocean. "Come on in", she calls, "it's nice." "The water must be too cold this time of year", I reply, and I do not go any further.

My mother and I are strolling outdoors on the landscaped grounds of a college campus. Suddenly the flat quadrangle we had been crossing ends abruptly at a small cliff. There is a vertical metal ladder at the edge of the cliff which my mother carefully climbs down. Now it is my turn, but I hesitate, wishing for a better way to descend. I now see that nearby there is a small cable car suspended from a loose wire cable. I grab the car with my hands and turn it so that the door faces me. I jump inside and the car starts moving wildly. It bounces up and down and sways to either side. I wish to steer the car, but find that I can not see where I am going: my eyes are closed tightly and are unable to open. (141 words)

My brother X. and I arrive for a vacation at a very busy airport in Israel. As we are walking through the terminal, I realize that our luggage did not arrive with us. "Oh", I say, "we were supposed to claim it in Cairo", referring to a previous stop-over in the Egyptian capital. "We have to go back there and get the bags." We struggle through the overcrowded terminal and reach a set of elevators. The elevator I am standing in front of takes a long time to reach our floor and I grow impatient. Just as I start walking towards another elevator, X. cries out, "Here it is!" The original elevator opens, and a large mob sweeps us in with them. When I get off the elevator, I find myself alone at Cairo Airport. In marked contrast to its Israeli counterpart, this airport is quiet, relaxed and almost empty. I find myself lying down outdoors on a patch of grass near a runway. The sun shines brightly and the airfield is surrounded by lush green trees. As I lazily look up from my siesta, I spot a small, single-passenger pedal-powered airplane hovering overhead. The pilot spins his craft, then stops it in mid-air, as he pedals what looks like a black flywheel with bicycle pedals attached. Then he releases the flywheel and glides away. The flywheel falls quickly and strikes a young man lying on the ground close to me. He does not appear to be hurt, but he is clearly annoyed. There is a young woman lying at his side who says of the pilot, "What an idiot!" Then the two of them look at each other and she hugs him around the waist. I get up and walk towards a nearby building. On the way a large group of teenagers passes in the opposite direction. At first I see a few boys and a few girls and do not note anything unusual. Then I see a boy walk by wearing a tank-top shirt which exposes his highly muscular arms. Soon another boy with a similar shirt walks by; he, too, has highly muscular arms. After him follows another boy with muscular arms, and then another and another. As the dream ends, there is a parade of youths with muscular arms walking past. (385 words)

Under a dark night sky, I am sitting outdoors at a large, popular music concert with a group of friends. The seats are the overly soft, somewhat worn, but very comfortable chairs that are found in many old movie theaters. My friends and I are all sitting in the same row listening to the music, which is very loud and is being perfomed by the "Mammas and Pappas". Their song intoxicates the entire audience. One row in front of us some people stand up and sit down to form a "wave". This wave is carried everywhere and I feel the chair I am sitting in rhythmically rise and fall every few seconds, as if it were floating on a sea with real waves of great height. This is a pleasurable thrill, a joyous release, and I am ecstatically carried away in the motion of the chair, the loud music, and the happiness of everyone around me. This physical high lasts for quite a while. (164 words)

It is time for X., a graduate student who is collaborating on research with our group at work, to defend his Ph.D. dissertation. Somehow X. has changed his field to music, and the doctoral defense is to be a piano recital. An appropriate recital hall has been set up, and I am among a group of people making a last minute check of the arrangements. We discover to our annoyance that the furniture on stage is lacking and that the piano is either missing or is not suitable. We leave the hall briefly and return carrying new furniture. One of the other people rolls in a beautiful grand piano on wheels. To test it out, we all sit around the keyboard and take turns improvising and singing silly songs. (129 words)

My former co-workers from the University of X. and I are standing outside on a grassy field with our (male) boss Y. Y. points his finger towards a building in the distance and says, "We have to get the equipment in that building." We suddenly find ourselves rummaging through the contents of a very large room. As we sort through dusty laboratory equipment, my mother, who has apparently joined our group, announces, "Here is his old clarinet!" She hands me the gray carrying case for the musical instrument and tells me, "Why don't you play it for us?" I open the case and assemble the clarinet. I play some notes, faking a melody as I go along. After thinking to myself, "I wonder if I can still do the upper register", I press the upper register shift key with my index finger and blow hard. A high-pitched note comes out clearly, and I continue inventing a melody. (157 words)

I am seated in an auditorium with many other people attending a seminar or training program. An announcement is made that the program is concluded and it is now time for all attendees to pick up their diplomas. A queue forms, and the person standing next to me in the line says, "You have to show the card you got when you paid the registration fee." "Oh", I reply, "I left the card in my room." I rush out of the auditorium and run through the hallways of what turns out to be a large hotel. I arrive at my room, and find my "roommate", X. (a male friend from college) there. "I'm getting my registration card", I tell him, but I do not find it there. Sensing that the card is back in the auditorium after all, I begin returning that direction. In the hallway I encounter Y. (a male colleague from work) walking past. "It's almost over", he informs me. "You'd better hurry." I run back to the auditorium to find it almost empty. A Strauss waltz is playing as a wooden partition or curtain is slowly being lowered over the stage. I run to my seat and see my receipt card lying there on top of my papers. Grabbing the card I cry out, "Wait! Wait!" (219 words)

I am in the experimental area at work talking on the phone with X., a colleague. Discussing the removal of a piece of apparatus that he and I had worked on, he informs me, "The lead-glass is really gone." He repeats this line three or four times. During the conversation I look out at the experiment and observe that a pressure test is being perfomed on the gas tank that we refer to as "GAS-C". As this happens I feel high air pressure in the lab affecting my ears. Someone walks by and remarks, "The GAS-C can take over two atmospheres." Suddenly there is an explosion and I watch in horror as the GAS-C tank blows out, damaging some other equipment nearby. The tank then shrivels up. Y. (a male collaborator) wraps the shriveled tank and surrounding layers in a blanket and carries it off with some other people for repairs. (151 words)

I examine the coins in some change I am given and find a very unusual nickel. On the reverse is a scene of the signing of the Declaration of Independence with many people; this scene is so large and busy that it is bursting out of the sides of the coin. The front of the coin has the normal face of Thomas Jefferson, and I see the year, "1937", clearly stand out. "This old coin must be worth something", I think. (81 words)

As a teacher in charge of some course, I am grading papers and I reach the one handed in by X. (a female friend). She didn't answer half of the questions, so I give her zeros for those parts. On the other questions, she has written only short answers, so I give her five points out of ten on each. Her low score bothers me and I decide to raise the score on some questions to six points, then seven. "Maybe I am being too hard on her", I think. (90 words)

I am driving my car on some quiet back roads. I speed through an intersection and continue going fast. At one point I turn the car very sharply and it spins around a few times as if it were a top. The main feeling of this dream is of letting loose. (51 words)

After a long journey I arrive at a house where I am to meet someone or encounter something. I wander alone about the house, which turns out to be my parents' house. Anxiously I wait for something to happen, vaguely aware that I will be meeting a group, perhaps of space aliens or magical elves. As I walk down the hallway and into the living room, I say to myself, "Now it's time." The curtains for the big picture window are open and there is a clear view of the outdoors. I step into the window as if to walk through it, but when I get there I find that everything on the other side is made of glass just like the window itself. I walk around in this glassy world where the view is translucent but blurry. All the objects I see, including trees, grass and rocks, radiate light through the eerie haze. (154 words)

My parents are divorced (in the dream). My brothers and I live at their house with my mother -- even though we are fully grown -- and my father lives in the city with his mother. He comes to visit and we have a lot of fun. I wonder why we don't see each other more often. I say, "Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but parents should stay together for the children's sake." One of my parents -- I'm not sure which one -- answers, "People change; we drifted apart; you're all grown up for years now." I feel anger followed by either resignation or acceptance of a loss.

I am on a space ship or station and there is a technical problem with some equipment on another ship or station. A friend of mine on board with me is worried about the problem, but I find myself telling him over a radio of some sort not to worry because I am fixing the problem. "You see", I say to him, "I went outside for a space walk." Indeed, I suddenly am out in space, working with some tools on the other ship or station. I finish the job and then radio to my friend, "As you know, there is no gravity here so I can just push myself back." I give myself a shove off the repaired vessel and begin drifting through the black space towards the mother space vessel. Just before reaching there, I see the big blue Earth a little to the side of my destination, and I slowly begin to change direction toward the planet. "Oh, oh", I say to my friend on the other end of the radio, "I'm feeling some gravity after all!" I still move slowly, floating through space and I see the Earth looming larger and larger as a giant blue and white globe. I pass through some kind of dense white barrier, like a cloud, and I radio to my friend, "Now I'm in the atmosphere. I should be burning up soon." My slow, floating re-entry now suddenly picks up speed, and I accelerate faster and faster in free fall, like a man who has jumped out of an airplane without a parachute. I then suddenly turn into a long, thin ribbon of ashes strewn across the sky for many miles. Still somehow retaining consciousness, I think to myself words to the effect of, "What a glorious way to go. Life has been a big adventure and I now I return to be ashes scattered all over the Earth. I will miss being able to see and hear, but this death is an adventure too." The dream ends with a feeling of exhilaration. (343 words)

I am walking along a dirt trail and I notice that someone is following behind. I quicken my pace but the person behind keeps up with me. Soon the trail gets wet with puddles and then it gets very muddy. I continue ahead but the mud becomes waist deep and so thick that I can barely move my legs. I am still being followed and I want to keep moving, so I grab some rocks and vines along the trail side with my hands and I pull myself forward. I repeat this a few times, moving very slowly since the trail now goes uphill. Finally I pull myself out of the mud and I see ahead a large lake at the base of a mountain, shining brilliantly in the sunlight. I feel that I have reached some sort of destination, but am disappointed in it. "This isn't the way it was described in X.'s paper", I say to myself, referring to a paper written by a male colleague at work. (170 words)

I am in a big lecture hall auditorium attending a class on gospel singing. The other students in the class talk a lot and seem more interested in sports, especially in the Mets game. I get in trouble for talking during the class and ask the teacher, "Why ME?" I am banished from the room for my bad behavior, and I promise the teacher to leave if I am allowed to speak before the class for "just one sentence." I stand before them all and proclaim proudly, "You all know, I'm the biggest fan." Then I gather my papers and march slowly out of the room with pride. (108 words)

I am at my parents' house and I see my father and his father working on fixing the back door. The entire frame around the door is loose and needs to be fastened back up. I see my grandfather holding everthing up -- door, surrounding molding, and even a little of the wall -- while my father is doing some sort of fastening. I say, "Let me help", and I assist in holding up the door and surrounding material. I overhear my grandfather telling my father about his father (my great grandfather), "When he was very old he would get out of the house and go for walks. We nailed the door shut but he would get out anyway and trample over three rows of flowers in the garden. We would find him just walking aimlessly around the neighborhood. He always said he just had to get outside." Now I look at my father and he looks older than I have ever remembered him being and I start to confuse him with my grandfather. I have trouble distinguishing the two of them and I try very hard to figure out which one is which. (194 words)

There is a knock at the front door of my house and I answer to find a slightly overweight middle-aged woman. She says, "Take me", and gives me a warm hug and a big kiss. I send her away, thinking to myself, "This is tempting but I don't know her." The screen door comes off its hinges as the woman leaves, and I try to put it back in place. Just then I hear some noises coming from the far side of my front lawn. I go out to investigate and find a group of maybe half a dozen people depositing bagged trash on the grass. I yell angrily at them and they disperse. However, I see that behind where the trash bags were placed is an encampment of several tents and shacks, all covered with twigs and sticks. "Look what they've done!", I complain to a friend who has just appeared. The friend and I run towards the encampment and grab at the sticks when we reach the first row of tents. Knocking the sticks aside, we are surprised to learn that the tents are all empty inside. "They must have left", I deduce. (195 words)

I am reading a ski magazine full of advertisements showing sexy pictures. I find it boring and I flip through the pages quickly. Finally I come across something which I find amusing: a middle section of the magazine which is a parody of itself. This joke section has a false cover page which shows skiers going downhill unsafely in various ways: skiing backwards without looking in the direction of travel, two people sharing the same pair of skis, and a passenger sitting on the shoulders of another skier headed straight towards a tree. The silly humor of this cover is a welcome relief from the slickness of the rest of the magazine. (112 words)

My girlfriend X. and I are on a guided tour of the White House in Washington, D. C. The tour guide informs us that tonight the President (Clinton) will attend a performance of a famous female singer (I can not recall which one.) The tour ends and I go to my parents' house for dinner. At the dinner table I mention that X. and I are going back out after the meal. We then get into a car and drive around a big city at night. We see a theater all lit up with a big marquee announcing a singing performance of the famous female singer. "Oh that lucky Bill Clinton", I say, "She is performing for him." Suddenly X. and I are walking around the inside lobby of the theater, where the furnishings are plush and ornate, and where everyone is formally dressed. Out of the corner of my eye I see my mother walk past. She is dressed up for the concert also, but she doesn't see me. I keep walking by, hoping not to be noticed. I vaguely hear X.'s voice behind me, sounding surprised at meeting my parents, but I keep walking ahead. Now there is an escalator and I go down. I hear my name being called but I am out of everyone's sight and I keep walking to another escalator, which I descend. Another time my name is called -- it is my mother's voice -- and now I feel as if I can not escape any longer. I look up and I see a balcony about two stories above me. There are my mother, my father and my girlfriend looking down at me. (280 words)

I am outdoors on a sunny day at a large public gathering, where the atmosphere is something between a carnival and a revival meeting. A young man stands before a crowd and tries to sell himself as a psychic and predictor of future events with unusual powers. The crowd quietly listens to him, but I can tolerate it no longer. I walk to the front to challenge him. "Is there any proof of his powers?", I ask. "Yes", the young man answers, and he waves about a copy of a hard-cover book written by himself with a photograph of himself on the cover. I find this most unsatisfying and I deliver the real challenge: would he be willing to write down SPECIFIC predictions for the next ten years? "We can write them down tomorrow and check again after ten years.", I propose. (142 words)

A car carrying two people inside pulls into the driveway of my house. The driver is a short, young woman who gets out of the car and walks to my front door where I am standing. She looks confused and opens a small piece of paper with the words "Republic Airport" written down, indicating that she is lost and seeks help. "It is not far from here", I say. Then she explains that her passenger is "X.'s wife", i.e., the wife of my girlfriend's boss. She asks if I can drive the two of them to the airport. I hesitate. Then the passenger gets out of the car and comes to the door. She is a tall, attractive middle-aged woman. "Pleased to meet you, Doctor Y.", she says to me gracefully. Impressed that she knows my title, I think to myself, "She really knows who I am." Then I say to the two women, "Okay, let's go." (157 words)

I am at a scientific conference being held in a large auditorium. I am sitting somewhere in the middle section when it is my turn to speak. I go to the front of the room and show my slides. Afterwards I sit down again, this time on the right-hand side of the hall. Looking among my papers, I find a book containing copies of all of the slides from all of the talks, including my own. One of my graphs is reproduced in a shiny metallic ink. "Oh, this is a good idea", I say to myself about the book. (100 words)

There is a woman who is the wife of someone else appearing earlier in the dream. Just to do something wild, she throws plastics bags filled with English Muffins into the swimming pool water and then she goes underwater herself. Inside the water it is peaceful and very quiet and she enjoys just sitting there, isolated from the outside world. She stands up and stares at the surface of the water which has now become a vertical wall rather than a horizontal ceiling. "It's nice here, but I can't live without oxygen", she thinks to herself, and she pokes her head through the vertical wall to the outside world. Now it is suddenly quite noisy. (115 words)

I am driving my bicycle down a country road which is on the way to work, moving very fast as if the bicycle were an automobile instead. I am not driving too carefully because I am tired, and I think to myself that I should really be going back home instead of to work. Suddenly a small deer -- a fawn -- walks out into the middle of the road as I race past. Then another small deer does the same, and this time I almost hit it. I keep going on and I next see a few more deer which are fully grown standing in the middle of the road. Finally a truly large, obese deer blocks much of the road and I stop. I walk my bicycle onto the sidewalk in order to catch my breath. There is a man standing nearby who admonishes, "Don't ride your bicycle on the sidewalk!" I walk my bike back onto the street, and as I mount it I answer him, "Look, I'm NOT riding on the sidewalk." (176 words)

I am travelling by train through England with some friends. In our car there is an official reception for the Queen of England who is travelling in the next car. My friends have brought chemicals with them and they start mixing them together. One of the male friends explains that they are making an explosive because he wants to blow up the Queen. I am disturbed by this, but another friend pleads with me to keep quiet. I remain silent since they are friends, but I feel that this is wrong. Finally, I can stand this moral outrage no more and I act decisively. I grab a glass bottle filled with a clear liquid and pour it out a sliding door on the train, thus thwarting the bombers' plans. A guard or policeman is standing there, and I complain to him, "You need tighter security around your Queen. In my country, you'd never get so close to the President with the materials for a bomb."

I am watching the filming of a movie scene involving three or four fast-moving cars. The people in the cars are all young and crazy, and they are having a lot of fun doing outrageous things, such as sitting outside on the roof of the car as it speeds. One young lady leans out of a passenger-side window so far that only her feet are still in the car; her head is held up by a man standing on the hood of the car next to hers. Suddenly one of the cars bumps into a structure on the side of the road and catches fire. The car comes to a stop by a nearby building, causing the building to catch fire also. A big wall of fire jumps out and now several buildings in the vicinty are burning as well. I am standing outside and am now surrounded by the flames. I am not sure whether this is a tragic accident or a planned part of the movie. (168 words)

I am asked to serve on an advisory commission in Washington, D. C. and be made an Honorary Member of Congress as part of some government program. I am flattered by the honor and I accept. Someone tells me that there is an orientation meeting for my group at 9 a.m., but I miss it. I arrive at the Capitol Building, and I can't find anything. I am standing in a large hallway made entirely of marble when I recognize other people in my program walking about, seeming to know where they are going. I ask several of them for directions, and they answer with the names of departments that I have never heard of. "How was the meeting this morning?", I ask another. "Oh, it was funny", he answers, "They did a show. But you didn't miss anything important." I am still lost, but I get a copy of a map that says "Federal Triangle" on the cover. Inside is the layout of many of federal office buildings with each individual office marked. "Wow, this is a useful map!", I think to myself. Then it is time to make plans for the evening. I say, "Should I stay here or go home?" X. (a friend of mine on Long Island, originally from England), who is standing next to me, says, "Well, I went home from here, but you'll have to fly if you want to get back in time in the morning." "You flew back to Long Island?", I ask him. "No", he answers, "I flew back to LONDON." I decide to stay in a hotel in Washington. (269 words)

I am at a gas station and a bad guy, "Charlie Brown", is coming to do mischief. I get up on the roof of the gas station in order to defend. When Charlie Brown arrives, I have the element of surprise. I jump down and somehow get him to a position where he is lying on the ground helpless. I have a rifle with me and I fire it in his general direction, apparently not actually harming him. He is shocked that I would shoot at a defenseless man and he tells me, "I wouldn't shoot if you were lying here." (101 words)

I am standing outside and I see a wall to my left. I walk up to it and notice that is a work of art, a piece of sculpture. It is painted blue and yellow, with parts decorated in a silvery metal. I examine it closely, marvelling at intricate carvings on its surface. "I wonder if it's real", I think to myself. "It's so detailed that this can't be a dream." (71 words)

I am delivering a guest lecture for a colleague in a modern college auditorium which has a lot of high-technology audio- visual aids set up. The audience in the lecture hall is small, but a video camera broadcasts my face to a medium-sized television screen. I feel that I am not effectively making my point, which is about books written by a forgotten author. While still talking, I fumble around with cables, trying to connect the video signal to a larger screen. Finally it works and my image appears on a movie-sized screen hanging from the ceiling. I feel more confident now because this picture is much more impressive than before. I show one book by a favorite author -- I can't remember who -- , holding it up to the camera for all to see. In it is a bibliography, which I read aloud. As I read each new book's title, I hold up that book, and its front jacket appears on the huge screen above. Every book is more obscure, and harder to find, than the previous one. These books are precious and meaningful to me, but I wonder whether I am getting through to the audience. (199 words)

I am sitting at the lunch table with my group from work, and somehow the subject of English girls has come up in the conversation. "I think they're cute", I say. "Are you kidding?", answers X. (a male co-worker) in disbelief. "No.", I reply, "They [the English] have a lot of charm and style." Y. (another male co-worker, who is French) is also at the table, and he suggests, "Yes, but what about the French?" "Have you met the new English post-doc joining our collaboration?", I ask them, adding that, "Her name is Z." Suddenly we are all outdoors and Z. appears. She races across a street in a car or some other vehicle. The vehicle crashes into the glass of a shop window and she falls out of the car and lies on the sidewalk. Seeing this, I run down the street to help her. "I'm okay", she reassures me when I reach her side. Not believing this entirely, I examine her head to find it covered with fine shrapnel of glass. I wipe some blood from her forehead with my handkerchief, but she doesn't seem to be too badly injured. (190 words)

I am outdoors in a town square. Someone tells me that there is something for me at the nearby window of a large public building -- is it the Post Office? I go there and am handed a calico cat which is the color and size of my pet A. "That's my cat", I say, and I am a little surprised. I start the voyage home with her. Somehow this involves a stop at my office at work. X. (a male co-worker) comes in and sees the cat in a carry case on the office floor. "Close the door", I say. He does this and then asks, "Does she roll around the floor [in the cage]?" "This isn't a hampster in a wheel", I answer, expecting him to know better. Then I arrive at my home with the cat, only to find that A. is already there waiting for me. "Oh, this is another cat", I realize. I put the two cats together on the living room floor to play. They look very similar, and I think to myself, "I guess I now have two cats." The new cat, however, frightens A., and A. stays away. I pick up the new one and hold her in my arms. Suddenly I notice for the first time that despite her beautiful fur, her mouth is ugly and has big teeth, reminding me somehow of a racoon. "I'll call you 'Coon'", I decide. Now Coon walks around the living room while A. sleeps. A. begins to shake and twitch in her sleep, and I realize that she is having a disturbed dream -- a nightmare? -- about being bullied by the new cat. She wakes up with a start, looks around for Coon, and moves away from her. (293 words)

A competition is being held for the purpose of determining who can break or shatter glass into the most beautiful geometric pattern. One of the contestants, a young boy, walks up on the stage and prepares to break a plane of glass standing beside him. For dramatic effect, he plays a musical flourish on a harmonica. Somehow the harmonica, which is tied to a string hanging from the ceiling, slips out of his control. The harmonica swings like a pendulum and strikes the pane of glass, much to the boy's horror. But the outcome of this accident is lucky, for the pane breaks first into four perfect quarters, followed by each quarter breaking into three pieces of equal size. The audience gasps in awe at this presumably winning entry in the competition. (132 words)

There is a Mets game at Shea Stadium with President Clinton attending, but otherwise the crowd is small and the seats are sparsely filled. Other people I know from work are there also, but most of them sit on the opposite side of the stadium from me. One (who?) comes over to join me on my side. The National Anthem is played while I imagine images to go with it, like a music video. I then hear the words, "Play ball!" (81 words)

I am in Geneva, Switzerland, for a short period of time. While I am there I meet a girl who is short, has black hair as well as a somewhat sarcastic sense of humor, and is very lively. We wander about the city streets doing fun things while she makes wisecracks. Then we come across an outdoor cafe which is on a patio one story below street level. We go down the stairs and eat dinner there. Suddenly it is my last night before going back to the U.S., and she comes back with me to the hotel where I am staying. We get into bed for the night but my mother is there too. I have my arm around the new girlfriend, but I feel uncomfortable about this with my mother watching. I get up and walk into the bathroom. Mother also comes in and she says to me, "Everything would be okay if she [the girlfriend] weren't here." She then returns to the bedroom. Thinking about my mother's remark, I say to myself ironically, "That's what I was thinking about her." [I.e., that's what I was thinking about my mother.] (181 words)

I'm on a television talk show along with a big, black man who appears to be the host. He jokes around with me since he is bigger than I am. To show that I am to be taken seriously, I grab him by the arm and drag him along the stage. He is quite surprised. "Okay, that was something.", he says and we sit down on chairs for the chatting part of the show. (74 words)

I dreamed that I was at a public affair but I don't know which affair it was although it was outdoors. There were many people around us and they were of all ages. I was at this affair with B. He is about twenty-six years old and he is the boy-friend of one of the girls that lives in the dormitory that I do. Whenever I felt the urge to get away from my escort or from the people at the affair, I would start to fly. (like superman). While up in the air I felt very uneasy and worried about how I would get back down without hurting myself. I left my escort about three times in this way. I do not remember why I felt that I had to get away.
Interpretation
I do not know why I would dream of B. I do not know him very well and I do not feel very friendly toward him when I do see him. I believe that I associated him with my studies and felt that I had to get away for a short while. When I had this dream, I hadn't been home for about eight weeks and was looking forward to going home. I felt that I wanted a short vacation from my studies and this dream was an escape mechanism in the form of a fantasy to get away from my classes for a short while.

I dreamed that I was in the office of the directress or nurses in the nursing school. She is about forty-five years old. She told me the results of an I.Q. test which I had taken in a psychology class. [I really did not take this test.] The I.Q. for this test was 169. She told me that my I.Q. for the test I had taken in the nursing school was only 80. She said that if I had made a higher score in the nursing test I would have received more credit hours for the training that I received from my hospital at home. [I did take a nursing pre-entrance examination. This test determines the number of credit hours that a nurse receives for her student training when she enters the graduate school.]
Interpretation
This dream is probably a form of wishful thinking. I would like to receive as many credits as possible for my student training. I did not know the results of the examination at the time of the dream. I had been thinking about the examination that day and I wanted to know about the results of the test.

I was in a room [The room is vague. It was probably my own room.] telling a friend [girl-friend about twenty-five years old] that I could get eagle stamps for 1/2 value of my purchase. I had previously read in a newspaper that you do not receive any value for eagle stamps if you have a charge account at this store.

I think that this dream was a form of wishful thinking. Since I save eagle stamps, I would like to receive full value for my purchases so that I can save more stamps.

I was sitting in my room reading the newspaper that I get from my home-town. I noticed a picture of my girl friend, A. from home. A. is twenty-four-years-old. She is one of my closest friends. Her picture was in the society section. She was dressed in a bridal gown and veil. Her picture was above the picture of her brother's bride-to-be who is about twenty-two-years-old. She was also dressed in a bridal gown and veil.
As I was reading the reviews of the wedding, I felt very unhappy because I hadn't been home to attend the wedding. I thought that the wedding was to take place a week later than it did. In the lower left hand corner of the page was another picture of A. and this picture was tinted. It was the same pose as the one above it. I couldn't understand why A. was wearing such an outfit. Neither could I understand why there were two pictures of A. in the paper.

Interpretation
I am looking forward to going home for the wedding of my girl-friend A. 's brother. He is going to be married November 15, 1947. I haven't been home for about six-weeks, so I am getting anxious to see my family and also A. and her family. I was thinking about the wedding the day that I had this dream. The dream itself is a bit confusing. I do not know why I dreamed that A.'s picture would be in the paper in two places on the same page. Perhaps the two pictures were just an emphasis of the fact that the wedding is associated with A. I know that she is going to be in the wedding party.

I dreamed that I had a date with one of the younger doctors (age approximately thirty three) on the staff at the hospital in my hometown. I was very happy when I met him at the door. He came in and we sat down and talked for a while. We discussed some of the patients that he had on the floor on which I was working & we decided to go dancing that evening. Then we started out to go dancing.
Interpretation
During my Xmas vacation I had been working at the hospital at home. I have known this doctor for a while and he is happily married. We are good friends. I think that I recognize in him certain qualities that I like in men. This was a form of wishful thinking. I would like to meet someone who has qualities similar to those of this man.

I dreamed that I was a guide at one of the parks here in C. I am not familiar with the park but I remember that I was directing people in the park to follow a sidewalk which would lead them to a voting booth. (Primary election this fall). There was a sign nearby that had bold red and white letters on it that said "VOTE FOR NUESS..." (or Neff...). I walked a little way with a lady about 50 yrs. of Age--no one that I knew--and then came back to my "post." There were a few other people of all ages in my dream but the lady I mentioned is the only distinct person that I remember. I didn't see the booth in the park but I felt as though there was one at the end of the walk. I remember that it way daytime and the sun was shining.
Interpretation
I do not know the candidate's name but he was running for mayor in the primaries this fall. (Here in C.) I had seen a man, the day of my dream, standing in front of a building, where voting was taking place, and he had a sign "Vote for Nuess... (or Neff...). I can't imagine why I would be doing anything for the election. I never have had anything to do with elections at any time.

I was in charge of a floor in our hospital in M. One of the nurses that was working on the floor was very untidy about the appearance of her hair. I remember that it was my duty to tell her that she must do something to her hair so that it would be tidier and neater. The other nurse is about my age - maybe younger. I told her about her hair and then the dream was gone.
Interpretation
I do not know why I dreamed this dream. The other nurse in my dream is not a nurse in "real life" but an X-Ray technician. I may have been conscious of my own hair being stringy the day before I had this dream. I did not think it unusual to be in charge of the floor at home because I had been in charge of the floor before I came here for p.g. work at W.R.U.

I dreamed that I went to take an examination and I was late for the class. There were ten minutes left in the period and the teacher was one that I had for an English course last term. The teacher told me that I should take the examdnation and to write as quickly as possible so that I could get some credit. I took a seat and was unable to find my pen. I looked through my purse frantically and finally found the pen, but it didn't have any ink in it. I got some ink from the desk and then I couldn't find my blue book. I just had a few minutes left when I did find the book so I quickly wrote out the answer to the first question. Then the bell rang. When I handed in my book, I felt that I had failed the examination.
Interpretation
I had been reviewing for a chemistry examination the day that I had this dream. I reviewed all the material that I could and I still felt rather insecure about the material that I had studied. I believe that I felt that I wasn't very well prepared to take the examination. This dream was probably just a continuation of this feeling.

I dreamed that I was trying to swim in a huge swimming pool that had no water. The fact that there wasn't any water in the pool did not hinder my activity. The pool was built at a 45 degree angle. I was swimming downward instead of upward. My actions were deliberate and I did not feel any anxiety while I was swimming. I remember very clearly that I was swimming downward and that I was slightly confused about the thought that I had to get back up to the top of the pool. There was a very short interval of the dream that I do not remember, but I do know that in some way or another I did get back to the top of the pool and I started to swim down again. (I did this twice.)
Interpretation
I am not a good swimmer but I do go swimming now and then to try to improve my strokes, etc. I think that I associated the swimming with two of my classes that I am taking at the present time. The day before I had the dream, I felt that these two subjects were "pulling me down" and I was swamped with work in these two classes. Perhaps the pool without the water was a symbol for the lack of background in these two subjects which I felt so concerned about at the time of the dream.

I dreamed that I was in one of my classes and we had just received the results of an examination we had taken about a week ago. I looked at my grade and it was marked "90 - 30, grade 60". I asked the teacher why I had thirty points taken off of my grade, and she said, ~You used a blue book that had notes in the back of it." I looked over the book and showed her that the notes were pertaining to another course. She said that she would give me the original grade but I should be careful of this in the future. My teacher was a lady about 40-45 years of age.
Interpretation
I was anxious to know the results of the test; I wanted to know the grade that I had made. I had to borrow a blue book before I could take the examination, because I had forgotten to bring a book to class. Before I had started to take the test, one of the girls asked me what time it was According to the M___ Code of honor, no talking should be done before, after, or during a test, while the girls are in the room taking a test. I thought that perhaps someone would think that we were discussing the test, and may have reported us. The above dream was a result of the anxiety that I had over the results of the test that I had taken about a week before the dream.

I was shopping in a large department store. I was looking for something very definite, but I wasn't sure of where it was, or what it was. I had to go to another floor, but I was afraid to get on the escalator because it was going so fast. Finally I steeled myself and forced myself to get aboard the conveyance. I was terrified going up at this break-neck speed. Finally I reached the floor above only to find that what I wanted was in reality downstairs. I was distressed at having to go down again, and confused by the milling crowds. Finally, I managed to get away from the crowd back into a deserted dingy corner where a dingy elevator was. I waited for it to come up with some misgivings, because I recalled similar experiences, from other dream situations, in which the elevator fell or went down too fast and made my stomach feel awful. But I had to get downstairs, and this elevator seemed the only way at the moment. I got in when it came and had the same feeling of inexplainable terror as we descended. It did go too fast, but it didn't fall completely out of control as I had feared, and on the whole wasn't half so bad as I'd anticipated. I felt relieved when I got out.
Interpretation
This dream, in slightly varying form of detail, has recurred to me at increasingly lengthening intervals ever since I can remember. At times, especially when I was younger, it was my mother I was looking for, and I was terrified because I was lost and separated from her. At other times, we were together, and I was afraid of the escalator or the elevator. I can't think of any reason for these dreams unless it is an insecurity I have always felt in my home life. I'm not sure, but it may be that I have this dream after my parents have had a serious argument.

My mother, father, older sister, and I were at a riding academy, negotiating with the elderly farmer and his wife for pony rides. There were several very small ponies grazing nearby, some brown and white and one black and white. As soon as I saw the black and white one, I was very excited and anxious to ride that one. The farmer remarked that we women were wearing dresses, and offered to wash out some old slacks for us to wear. We were reluctant at first, but the wife was so anxious to have us do so that we must finally have agreed. She smiled almost fixedly at us, and I was fascinated by her shiny face and her literally apple-like cheeks, very round and brilliantly red. Then we were riding horses under an archway past the stables. This scene seemed familiar to me. I think I have dreamed this same riding scene before.
Next we were staying at the farmhouse which seemed to be a winter sports lodge. Somehow it fell to my lot to investigate some sort of crimes going on in the lodge. It was extremely dangerous and I felt as though I were constantly in peril. During the course of the investigation, my companion, (I think it was a girl about my own age who was supposed to be a friend of mine, but I can't identify her), and I discovered several human bodies lying on a wide ice-filled ledge jutting from a wall in the basement. I was surprised and a little repulsed at seeing my aged grandfather's body among those there. The arms and legs seem to have been cut off and were wrapped with the rest of the body in a great deal of grayish gauze with only the head protruding. My companion found a female relative of hers there, too, and expressed the same feelings I had. I was puzzled as to how they got my grandfather's body there, since he died and was buried last April.

In the next scene I was in a bedroom searching for "evidence" but I don't know what. My companion was with me but I had the feeling she was either not on my side, or just not of any help to me. Just as I was coming out of the room, hurriedly to escape detection, the two occupants came back. They passed me coming out of their room as they went in, but paid no attention to me, as though it were quite natural for me to be there. I was greatly relieved. One of the men was a large, heavy Englishman, slightly more than middle age, and the other, whom I knew to be the brains of the outfit, was the Mickey Rooney type. Somehow, I knew that he was 18 years old. He was very handsome and attractively dressed in light clothes.

In the next scene I discovered the secret. My companion and I were crouching outside the basement window, peering into a large room with rows of tables. Many men worked there, each at his own table, assembling parts of dismembered bodies, and applying make-up to them to prepare them for display. On each table were piled arms, legs, thumbs, and bodies in various degrees of dismemberment. I was at once fascinated and horrified at what I saw, but satisfied with the "solution."

Interpretation
I can't imagine anything more like a radio mystery story. Since these are my favorite radio diet, the dream may mean that I closely identify myself with the heroic radio detectives. I got great satisfaction out of my role in this dream. I was the "big deal." There were many people relying on me, it seemed. I was participating in the kind of excitement I never could find in real life, and when I awoke I felt very relaxed and pleased.

Answers to questions
2. At various times in the dream I explained being:--excited, anxious, fascinated, surprised, repulsed, puzzled, relieved, horrified.
3. Participant
4. Both
5. Inside and outside a winter sports lodge
6. No, except one portion in the beginning which I explained as seeming to me to have been a part of other dreams I have had from time to time.
7. I was very conscious with the intense red of the farmer woman's cheeks. I never remember having been conscious of color in any dream before.

It seems there was some sort of University rally at M--A. building. All the boys and girls were supposed to parade through the building. Before the rally got to the building, several other girls and I went up to the third floor of M-- to explore. It seems we weren't supposed to go up there, according to the rules. We were very surprised to find that the teachers had their offices there. The hall was lined with shelves of books, something on the order of the arrangement of the second floor of the wing. I took several books off a table to put them on the shelf I knew belonged to this particular teacher. (Each teacher had a section where she kept her books.) Just as I was putting the books on the shelf, I noticed that a door at the end of the corridor was ajar and Miss K-- was sitting at her desk, looking at me. "Those aren't her books. They're mine!" she said crossly. I quickly put the books back down, and thought I better get away from there before she realized I was there against the rules, and I got into trouble.
The girls with me weren't very important in the dream. About this time, they dropped out of the action. I didn't want to get caught in the rally crowd, for some reason or other. I heard them coming up to the third floor so I thought I would hurry and get down the back way before they got upstairs. There were several stairways at intervals in the hall, and from where I stood, sort of in the middle, I could see them all. People were beginning to come up the stairway I had wanted to escape down. I ran to one of the others, and the same mob was already surging up there, too. It was the same with all the stairways, and by the time I had discovered this it was too late to get away at all, so with a resigned feeling of disgust I allowed myself to be swept along for a ways. It seemed to be a square hall, and we went all around it and then we were to go back downstairs again. As we reached the stairway, I noticed that just at the head of it there was a bathroom. I felt that this was my chance to escape so I ducked in there without anyone seeing me. There was a combination of a clothes chute, dumb waiter, and spiral stairway in the bathroom which I thought it would be a cinch to use for escape.

It was up quite high from the floor and with some difficulty I managed to get my legs into it in preparation to descend. Then it seemed as though it was smaller in diameter than I had first thought it to be, and higher from the floor. I felt trapped. I couldn't get down through the tube, whatever it was, and I was stuck so that I couldn't get back down to the floor. I was getting worried and was trying to think of some way I could get down through that opening. Then all of a sudden I could get out quite easily, and I found, looking down, that from my position I could easily and safely jump to the floor. I was greatly relieved and I jumped down and all my problems seemed to have been solved.

Interpretation
My situation of being stuck and having several alternatives, not knowing what to do reminds me of the situation I was in the evening before I had the dream. I came home in quite a confused mood after being almost stranded in a strange neighborhood, trying to call a cab from a neighborhood bar and being stopped in my purpose by a local hoodlum, and finally a male and a female friend of mine showing up with a car and taking me home. I was quite upset when I went to bed, and I think this may account, in part for the dream.

Answers to questions
2. I was surprised to find teachers offices there, a little frightened at Miss K--, disappointed & disgusted at being caught in the rally, frightened and frustrated in the chute, relieved when I got out safely.
3. Participant
4. Unpleasant
5. M-- A-- building, the non-existent "third floor," and a bathroom there.
6. I have dreamed being caught in similar predicaments, and some scenes in those halls I know have been present in other dreams, but the plot of the dream this time was new.

I walked into a tiny picturesque blacksmith shop and there, at a large table, the blacksmith and his wife were shoeing a tiny white donkey. I knew it was a donkey although it was no bigger than a fox terrier. It was lying flattened on its stomach, front legs out front, hind legs out back. The blacksmith's wife was holding his head while the blacksmith held one dainty hind foot between his thumb and forefinger and filed the shoe around the edges. I talked to them, and noticed that the blacksmith had a handful of tiny horse shoes similar in size and shape to copper pennies with a horseshoe-shaped rim around them. Then I saw a rather large two-wheeled cart standing next to the donkey. "Does he really pull that?" I asked, and they answered proudly, "Oh, yes, all the time." I felt sorry for him, having to pull such a large wagon, but I just said, "Isn't that remarkable."
The blacksmith was very nice. He led me into the adjoining barn where there were larger white donkeys, saying, ''I'll tell you the story about why these white donkeys wear shoes." The barn was sweet and pleasant, and the animals had very human expressions on their faces. I had a very comfortable feeling of being glad to be there hearing the story. I felt as though I had gone back to live in a fairy tale. The story started to be very interesting. It would have been a wonderful story, I am sure if I could have heard it. Just as it was begun, however, my mother was waking me up. I was very disappointed at having to awaken.

Interpretation
One of my friends who helps keep me supplied with dreams was telling me her dream about a tiny horse the day before I had this dream. It struck us both as very funny as she told it, and we laughed a good deal about it. This may have had something to do with why I dreamed about a miniature donkey. I can't think of any other explanation.

Joe Louis was at my house. It seemed as though he was playing an engagement here as a trumpet player. He sat in a familiar chair in my living room and played hot trumpet music. Our front door was open and there were a great many people on the front porch and in the front yard who had come to see and hear him. I sat opposite him and became more and more interested in him. I decided that, since there was some place I had to go after his performance, I'd promote things so that he'd take me. He kept looking my way and smiling and I felt greatly encouraged. All of a sudden a young colored girl hurried through the room and upstairs to remove her hat and coat, casting a coy glance at Joe as she passed. I wondered whether it was his wife or his girl. He turned to me and said, half to me, half as though he were talking to himself, "At last she came to see me! I didn't think she would, she hasn't come for so many of my shows, but now she's here!" I looked at hlm and saw that his eyes were brimming with tears. I was very surprised to see evidences of such deep emotion, and also considerably crestfallen because that ended my chances.
Interpretation
My girl friend and I had previously been discussing race relations. She is taking a sociology course concerning the Negro, and we had considered gleefully the sensation we would create among some other of our friends if we should take to dating Negro men. When I was plotting in my dream, I was delighted with the prospect that I would be able to call my friend and tell her that I had been the first to date a Negro.

I was with my family and some friends in a car parked across the street from the little church I used to attend. We had been somewhere and were on the way home, but why we parked there, I don't know. The general atmosphere in the car seemed to be strictly inharmonious. I was out of sorts because I was the only one there without a date, and I sat slouched down in the corner of the front seat. My mother, father, older sister were there, together with several couples of my friends whom I am unable to identify. It seems there were some dishes down in our church basement which I had mentioned a dislike for at one time. I had mentioned this unthinkingly in a casual manner to a character with whom I had gone out several times. He is a couple of years older than I am and has a friend of the same age who acts as his stooge, humoring along his boorish tendencies, and laughing at his jokes: generally, stooging for him, although he's a little less ignorant. All of a sudden, I saw this fellow, together with his stooge and the latter's wife (he's not married really, and the man in the dream didn't look like him, but I knew it was he), come out of the church basement carrying piles of these dishes and laughing loudly and hysterically. They crossed the street and came over in front of our car. Then my "friend" started to put on his act. He would hold out a dish at arm's length and with a deliberate gesture, drop it on the ground and let it break. He had different ways of breaking them. Some he dropped in this fashion and others he crushed in his hands, still others he tossed in fancy ways before he let them break. I was utterly revolted that he could think up such a thoroughly stupid thing to do. I was completely disgusted, and tried to pretend that I didn't see him so that he would go away. I think the other people in the car were amused, and laughed every once in a while. He laughed hysterically as he performed, calling, "Look -- look!" I slouched down further in the corner of the seat, but I couldn't help smiling every once in a while. I don't know why because I certainly didn't think he was funny.
Interpretation
Although I have dated this man several times, I think he is an utter character. I spend my time avoiding him now. This act I dreamed of his putting on is just the sort of thing he would really do to attract my attention, or try to get my favor. I have a few facts that might in some way explain the dream. One, he is of a radically different religion from mine, and we don't see eye to eye at all on this score. This may have something to do with the setting of the dream near the church. One time when I was with him, I casually admired a lovely cigarette ease in a jewelry store window, and he went down and bought it the next day for me. This case reminds me of the casual mention of not liking the dishes prompting him to break them all to win my favor. Then, of course, there is Freud's interpretation of breaking dishes. I find it rather difficult to apply this to my dream, however.

College women, late 1940s:#0017 (Code 002, Age 21, 03/27/48)

I had some sort of report that it was very important for me to give to our family doctor, an elderly man whom, incidentally, I do not like. I looked out of the living room window and saw him driving slowly by in a car with two other people, a man and a woman. I ran out to him with several papers (my report--it seemed as though it was some sort of progress report on my own condition) in my hand and caught up with him a few doors down the street. I felt very kindly toward him, and very glad to see him, just the opposite as I should feel in real life. The man with him in the car was a man who lives in my neighborhood and whom I have seen many times, but whom I do not know by name. He is older than I am, but I do not think he is thirty yet. The woman was no one I knew, and she was not familiar to me in the dream. It seemed as though the man knew me very well, but I was quite surprised to find him so cordial and interested in me when I didn't even know his name. He sat very close to the old lady with him, and once said something affectionate to her and kissed her, at which she giggled. At first, I thought this most unusual that so young a man should be with an old woman, but no more I had thought that when I "realized" that it must be his mother. I was very satisfied with that explanation. Then the doctor started to drive the car in the opposite direction from where it had been facing, and about two doors down from my house on the other side, I saw several people coming out. First, was a girl whom I recognized as a girl I went to junior high school with, who had been a very good friend of mine. It didn't look like her, but I knew that it was she. Then a young man came out, following her to the car, and I thought he looked vaguely familiar, concluding that it was J--, the boy L-- had a crush on in Junior high school. I wondered whether she had finally been successful in winning him, and projecting forward in some way, asked someone later about it who told me that they were now married, after many troubles and separations. I felt very pleased about this, and remarked about it to my companions. I felt as though my faith had been restored in human nature.
Interpretation
Free associating, I can get a few ideas. The man in the car was blond, as was a man I had a date with Thurs. Having a reputation of a cynic, his liking me was a great surprise to me. Ages and birthdays came into our conversation, and I found I was 2 months older than he. That may explain the old woman and young man. I can also tie in the thought of finding something finally after trials and tribulations, as L-- did in the dream. In connection with the first thought, I might mention that I knew this date of mine previously, but had never dated him before. When I really talked to him, I found that he was a very different person from what I had assumed him to be after taking in all the things I had heard about his cold cynicism. The more I free-associate, the more I feel that this explanation has much to do with the dream.

College women, late 1940s:#0018 (Code 002, Age 21, 04/23/48)

I was coming home from work with two people. One was an older woman whom I believe is somewhere in her fifties, a very active person who, somehow, always seems to me much like my mother. The other person seemed to have been another of my co-workers (the older woman being a woman with whom I work at a department store), although I never did actually establish who it was. It seems to me as though it was supposed to be a boy acquaintance of mine, someone with whom I used to go to school a number of years ago and whom I haven't seen for several months because of the fact that he is in the navy. He is about six months younger than I am. As we came out of the store I was aware of the definite need not to look directly at this third person. I thought, "I don't want to give him the satisfaction that I am being eager." When we got outside, we boarded a conveyance: a sort of flat cart on wheels drawn by a horse and driven by a coachman seated high in front. The older woman and I got on one side, and the other person, who I almost subconsciously sensed to be this boy, got on the other side, with his back to ours. I again was very careful not to turn around so that he wouldn't think that I was looking at him. I thought, "It certainly will be wonderful to tell everyone when I get home that I actually rode in one of these things." For this brief instant it seemed that we were in a strange city or country. Then I began to feel uneasy about getting home. We had to sit very carefully so that we didn't get jarred off the cart as it bumped down a steep hill. All of a sudden the woman jumped off, saying, "Oh, my goodness I must have forgotten my glasses. I'll have to go back to get them I can't see a thing without them." And she began to search through her pockets in a distressed manner while following the slowly moving cart down the street. I had a sinking feeling at the thought of having to turn back to retrieve the glasses, and sort of hoped that she would go back alone if she had to get them. But she didn't--she was running along behind, trying to catch up with the wagon, although it was going very slowly. Incidentally, I'm sure she had her glasses on, I remember noticing them, but just didn't feel like telling her, I guess. I figured if she said she forgot them, then she did. Another thing I remember was wondering, shortly after we got on, how we would manage the matter of the fare--concluding that we would undoubtedly each pay a part of it.
Interpretation
I can't offer any interpretation for this dream. I an of the opinion, however, that these people are really supposed to stand for others, because of their remoteness to me. I have no particularly strong relationship to either of them, and seldom do they cross my conscious mind.

We were at a large gathering. It may have been lunch time at school, but it seemed to be more of a party. I guess just about all my girl friends were there. I recognized many of them, but I can't recall who most of them were. I don't remember whether there were any men present. One girl was walking around blinking her right eye and looking quite miserable. I recognized her as a girl whom we try to escape at lunch every day at school. She's quite repulsive, and none of the girls care to have much to do with her. In my dream, no one was paying any attention to her as usual. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she'd had something in her eyes for days. She was working at it with a bobby pin and I immediately realized this was very unsanitary, so I offered to get it out for her. I pulled down the lower lid and saw a tiny black speck in the corner of the eye. I decided first I'd need a toothpick, but thought, but there aren't any around here, with a feeling almost of panic. Then I remembered having seen some somewhere, and found them in a very unusual place, on a shelf where I would never expect to find them. They seemed to pop up there just because I needed them. I had the feeling that I was very triumphant. I felt almost as though I had worked magic. I took several out of the box they were in, and put one in my mouth because I felt that after all, that was where toothpicks belonged. Next, I needed some cotton, and that turned up in much the same way as the toothpicks had. I felt the same way about finding that. I also felt pleased with myself because I was being so benevolent to this character. I didn't waste any love on her, to be sure, but I felt that I was at least doing my moral duty which was more than any of the other girls were doing.
Interpretation
I can't offer any interpretation, because I can't think of any possible connections between the dream and anything which happened on the previous day or any other time. It seemed so unimportant a dream that I suppose it had a very deep meaning.

College women, late 1940s:#0020 (Code 002, Age 21, 05/01/48)

I was at a party given by a club of boys who are good friends of mine. Their parties are quite famous, and so are they personally, as definitely extra-special. I met them almost two years ago, about four months before I broke up with my "steady", and after that, I began to be considered as part of the club's gang of boys and girls. All the boys were at the party in my dream, and all their regular girls whom I know so well. I was having a wonderful time, and felt so happy as to be almost floating on air. All of a sudden, in a very natural way as though it weren't unusual, in walked my "ex". I was so happy to see him that I almost ran up to him and threw my arms around him. But I didn't. I greeted him and felt gratified that he was very friendly and held no grudge. (This would be very unlike him in real life, I'm afraid.) We sat down together on a davenport in the middle of the long, smoke-dimmed room. Just before he ("Ex) came in, the boy who brought me to the party left with his best friend, also a member of the club and a good friend of mine. They were going out to buy more supplies for the party. The fact that my date would come back and find me with this strange man didn't seem to worry me at all. All I could think about was how happy I was that he had come to the party. I was just dying to introduce him to all of the people there. I said, "I'm so glad you've come back, because now you can meet all my wonderful new friends, and I can share them and these good times with you." Then I thought I'd better ask him how he happened to come there. He held my hand and looked seriously into my eyes and said simply, "I came back because I still love you." I was so thrilled and so completely happy that I woke up.
Interpretation
This sounds like wish-fulfillment to me. I have thought so many times since I have met the club how much he would enjoy the people. At times I have thought, "I'm having such a good time at this party (or picnic) but it needs only one thing to make it perfect--". In my dream I got the one thing that made everything perfect.

My girl friend came over with a mutual friend of ours, a boy whom I have dated off and on for over a year and who I met through her. They disclosed to my slyly that the time had now come for me to meet "the real John Doe" (the boy). I was mildly surprised to learn that this boy whom I had thought I knew so well was only taking the part of the real one. I was mildly interested in knowing what the "real John Doe" was like. At no time were my emotions about any of this very strong. I was only mildly affected by the strange happenings. On the way to the Real John Doe's house they told me that I would like the real one much better. Finally, we arrived and went down to the basement where he had his darkroom. The boy I know is very interested in photography, and the scene was familiar to me as being in his home and just the way we have gone down to inspect his darkroom in real life. When we got down into the basement, there was this "real John Doe" absorbed in his photography work. The one whom I had known as John said dramatically to me, "THIS---is the Real John Doe!" We said "how-do-you-do?" and he immediately began to tell me why his identity had been hidden from me. I thought it was all very nice, but it didn't surprise me that the real John expected the false John to do a fadeout. No one seemed to be surprised by anything. The real John had some of the same physical characteristics as the one I had known, but there was no mistaking one for the other. The real one seemed to be milder and kinder and had the look about him that would make people say at first glance, "My, isn't he a nice boy!" That was how he differed from the false John.
Interpretation
This sounds very much like an actual experience changed around so that the main person is different. My girlfriend had a boyfriend whom He both admired because he was so different from other "angle boys". He was so completely unemotional for five months while dating her that we had begun to believe he was that way naturally. Then one day our faith in human nature was shattered. We found he was just the opposite of what we had believed him to be. We expressed this fact by saying that we had now an acquaintance with "the new -----. I had this dream right after our discovery, and it certainly all ties in.

I decided to get married so I did. That was just the way it happened, almost as though one minute I was single and the next married. Then I began to have qualms about what I had done so impetuously. I thought, "But I don't even know this man. Here we are married, I'll have to live with him the rest of my life, and what if I find out he's not what I want in a mate?" Then I thought, "I can get a quick divorce because we were just married, and no one need ever know". Then I decided nobly, "No, you've done this thing and it's up to you to make a go of it. In a few years you'll get acquainted and you can learn to love him". (Reminds me of the things I have read repeatedly in the lovelorn columns of the newspapers. That's usually the kind of advice they dole out.) Then the man came into the picture. He wasn't bad looking and seemed to be a nice enough person, although he doesn't remind me of anyone. I don't know how I happened to choose him to marry. He seemed almost to not even be aware of our marriage, and to care less. He took the attitude, "Well, we're married, and I suppose we'll have to stay that way--this is your show, so you call it. What do we do now?" That was beginning to worry me, too. I thought what will people say when they find out about this? They will expect us to act married, and I can't act married with this man I don't even know. I remember in the beginning of the dream noticing that I had on a cheap engagement ring. It was silver. I thought people might think it was platinum, but anyhow I was glad he had been nice enough to get a sterling silver one. It had been nice on his part since, of course, since he didn't particularly care for me he had not morally been obligated to do anything like that for me. Now the ring had become a plain wedding ring. I remember that we had a conversation concerning our situation. He smirked good-naturedly in an I-don't-care way, and let me know that if I wanted to act married, he'd go along with it, and if I didn't he didn't care either. I practiced calling him affectionate names like "honey", but I felt very foolish and uncomfortable doing it. He treated me in the same affectionate way. I was full of remorse for having been so eager, but I thought, well he's a good guy, maybe we can work it out.
Interpretation
Could be I have been thinking too much lately about getting married, and thinking about it in an entirely objective way, weighing this one against that one. After thinking such cold and calculating thoughts without a qualm, this dream may have come as a manifestation of my inner anxiety over such a course of action.

In my dream, I first saw a group of girls standing in front of a school building. One of the girls I recognized as a high school and church friend. She was laughing and singing along with the other girls, who were all standing in a circle. The group of girls stood there for a few minutes and then ran away from the building. I then entered a room in which sat my mother, sister, and her little boy. The little boy wanted to sit in a funny little round chair that was very dirty. I went over to a sewing basket and removed a cloth, with which to dust the chair. In the meantime the baby had gotten hold of a pair of scissors, and was cutting something. I took the scissors from him.
Interpretation
The first part of my dream probably is due to my constant thinking about school, especially now after have attended so many teas this last week, at which so many girls were present. I was recently speaking with the mother of the girlfriend I recognized in the dream. The little baby was probably my little nephew, who lives with us. I imagine it is the awareness of his mischievousness that led me to dream of him and his actions with the scissors.

I was sitting in a room surrounded by many people. Everyone seemed very excited and were all talking rapidly among each other. I was apparently surprised to see some of the people there. A man was there by the door, but he didn't say anything and didn't stay very long. I recognized many of the people as close relatives to me and my family.
Interpretation
I think this dream is a product of my thinking about my grandfather's death and funeral. Many of the people around me were older people, all of my grandfather's relatives. I imagine I was surprised at seeing some of them, because at the funeral there were many relatives from out of town that I hadn't seen for many years.

As I first remember the dream I was upstairs in a room with my sister-in-law, who is a nurse. I was mixing some blue chemicals. We were talking happily, next I was out in another room with my girlfriend from school. A teacher, whom I can't recall, was lining all the girls, (many of whom I recognized and spoke with) in a straight line to have their tonsils out. I stood in the line at first and then, finally remembering that I had had my tonsils out, I left with my girlfriend. We went downstairs and there in a little room off to one side, were a group of fellows singing and laughing. We stopped and talked with a few, and then we left.
Interpretation
I cannot interpret much meaning to this dream. I am taking chemistry at the present, and might be conscious of my sister-in-law, because she is a nurse and I am making my application now to send to a training hospital. I can't imagine how the tonsils fit into the dream, although it is true that mine are out.

I was at a summer resort. As I was going down the stairs into the beach, I saw on one part of this beach, huge cockroaches. I hurriedly ran past them and safely went into the water. There were many others in the water with me, and on the shore I saw a little dark-haired boy playing in the sand. To the left of me by the water was a public beach & many were swimming there in the water. Later I went into the house, where everyone was eating. A lady and her little baby were sitting with me.

I found myself in an apartment where I lived about twelve years of my life. Before I had a chance to look around, the landlady's daughter, 35 yrs., came out and hugged me. This part of my dream was peculiar, because during all the years we lived in that apartment, this lady never cared for me. She took me up to visit our old suite of rooms. In reality the rooms are quite small and plain. In my dream the rooms were spacious, light and beautifully furnished. The sun seemed to be streaming into all of the rooms. There was a lady in the rooms, whom I thought I recognized, but she wouldn't look at me, so I couldn't be sure.
Interpretation
For some time I have been hoping to get an apartment, and I think this dream represents that wish. It sees that even such an uninteresting place as that apartment was, it would probably look very inviting to me. I can't think of who the extra lady in the dream could be.

I dreamt I saw the young man who sits next to me in my sociology class. I don't recall how, but somehow I knew he was unusually intelligent. He had received a 100 on an important exam, and yet I knew he hadn't taken a note since the beginning of the semester. Again somehow I explained it to myself so that it seemed logical.
Interpretation
There is a young man who sits next to me in one of my sociology classes, and he hardly takes a note. Since there is no text book and the exams are based on class notes, I have often wondered just how well he did on the exams.

I dreamt I was hurrying somewhere from work. Someone was with me, although I couldn't tell whether I knew the person or not. Suddenly we were seated in the balcony of the public auditorium. It was the wedding of one of my friends. (The young lady, age 21, will be married in two weeks.) She was dancing on a platform in a maroon and blue dancing costume. When she saw me she leaped up to the balcony and kissed me. The next thing I knew she was walking down the aisle in the traditional white gown.

It was as though there was a swimming show, for each girl seemed to have a special feat to perform. It seemed as though they were swimming and diving for a very long time. I wanted to join in the pageant, but I seemed spellbound. Suddenly something happened and I was in the midst of the aqua group. I knew just what part I had to do and I did it.

I found myself walking to a class with one of my former professors, a man in his late thirties or early forties. He was explaining that his class was being held in a large auditorium and that he was having some trouble with snakes in the room. We reached the building and I stood in the background while he opened the side door to see if the snakes were still there. At first nothing happened, but gradually snakes began appearing in increasing size and number. The next thing I remember, I was jumping from one table to another trying to escape snakes of all sizes, a good many of them very large. They were coming very close but apparently never reached me as I awakened with no particular feeling of anxiety. The only question left in my mind was how I got away.
Interpretation
The stimulation for dreaming of snakes may have come from a discussion the afternoon prior to the dream, in a C-- P--class. We were talking about establishing fear responses toward rats and. snakes. I have had a terrible fear of snakes ever since I read Ripling's story of the Cobra, prior to entering Junior High. I also listened to a friend describe South American snakes (last fall) and had all kinds of horrible visions of Boa Constrictors attacking travelers, etc. This is the only logical interpretation of this dream that I know of.

I was taking a F-- D--- exam when I happened to notice one of the boys in the class cheating. I went over to see what he was writing and noted that he was copying word for word the paper of the boy next to him. Knowing that a new rule had just been established that all cheaters were to be reported and that they would be suspended if proved guilty, I determined to turn the boy in. (I have never liked this boy, he is a pre-ministerial student at W-- and is always cheating in tests.) This seemed a good way to teach him a lesson so I typed up the report to hand to the Dean in the morning. The next day I couldn't bring myself to report him but had mentioned it to several people. By noon I heard that most of the class had been reported for a similar offense and everyone accused me of doing it. One of the girls included was a very good friend of mine and I was extremely upset to think that she would think I did it. When the dream ended I was still busy trying to clear myself of the implications.
Interpretation
The stimulus for this dream no doubt arose from an article I read that evening concerning scholastic cheating and the method of dealing with it which has been recommended, namely the honor system and ensuing reports, on all offenders. As I said the boy in question is a constant cheater and it irks me to think that he not only cheats but is going into the ministry on that basis. I dislike him and often wish he would be caught. I didn't turn in the report because I don't feel that that is the method of cure, and also because I never want to be known as a squealer.

When the dream began I was busy packing my clothes in the car to come home from College. I was solving the problem by carrying the whole dresser into the back seat of the car and then putting in the drawers which were packed with all my things. Later I went off to class, my last one in that school. It was on a second floor of what appeared to be a gym. One wall had large windows in it which were covered by newspapers. A young boy was busy stripping the papers off the windows and when gone we could see into the gym itself. Class was soon over and several of my very close friends and I went downstairs to have a cigarette and discuss the events to follow. It seemed that we were electing a queen for some affair and no one knew who it was. Several minutes later we ran up to the gym for the procession was to start. Elaine, a friend of mine and I were standing in good view of everything, right at the end of the aisle for the procession. The trumpets blew and I stood there eager]y trying to see who was the queen when a chorus of voices shouted my name. I was to have the honor because I was leaving for another school and they were showing me in this way what they thought of me. My surprise was immeasurable to say the least and I almost cried. The dream ended with Elaine walking me down the aisle to lead the procession.
Interpretation
Much of the material for my dreams of late has centered about the fact that I just left W. It's a time like that when you find out what people think of you, especially those who you consider your friends. I found out, when I was given a party just before leaving and it was very gratifying, to say the least. As far as the queen was concerned, we have been discussing that kind of thing as my sister has been up for a dance queen several times of late. Why I would identify myself with that kind of thing I don't know, except that I feel it would be quite an honor and would love it.

I dreamed that I was watching a group of boys in a large gym preparing for some game. In the center stood a boy whom I date quite a bit. I tried to wave at him but couldn't get his attention. From there the scene moved to a pool where a game was in progress. The object of the game was to jump in the water and pop balloons with a hammer. After watching this I dove into the pool. Shortly afterwards I noticed the pool was empty. The next time I went in there was water in it. Then I took a long run along the side and was in the air over the pool when I noticed it had been drained again. I righted myself and landed on my feet. I remember some feeling of embarrassment for having gone into an empty pool. As I was climbing out I started fussing with an ice cream push cart which had several bowls of sauces at one end. Somehow I upset the whole thing and several of us hurried out with it before the gym teacher came and found the mess. We took the cart outside once and tried to fix things up. The rest of the dream is quite hazy.
Interpretation
I don't find any reason for this dream. I like to swim quite a bit and make a habit of diving in and coming right out again. And I have often wondered what would happen if you did dive into an empty pool. As for the rest of it, I just have no idea how to explain it.

I dreamed I was in N__ Y__ with my family. We were out at a big building which someone said was M-- S-- G--. It was dark green with the sides open and extended for miles. We stood beside it for a while and then got on the subway to go back to the center of town. The subway was run on the same principle as a roller coaster. We went on a level for a while and then zoomed up an incline. Every time we stopped I was tilted to the side. Finally we got off the "subway" and stood looking at a large wall map of C-- painted as a mural and put on a cement wall. From there the dream is a blur. I remember my Mother sat in the seat beside me, however, on this "subway", and my Father was in front.

I was dreaming about taking some sort of trip. I arranged 4 packs of cigarettes, Lucky Strikes, which were partially empty, each to different degrees, to divide my vacation into four parts. I gave them to someone, telling what date each stood for, I remember one that was for July 20, the other dates have faded. One pack was almost empty, having 4 or 5 cigarettes left. Transition here fades and I was then in a store trying to use a pack of tickets for a trip on some lake. The man I was talking to runs the soda fountain at the corner drug store. He told me that I must have 2 tickets next to each other on the ship with the number 34 at the bottom right hand corner of each one. The tickets were arranged with numbers much like on a calendar. I didn't find tickets arranged this way I only found one that had a 34 on the corner. Transition again fades and changes and I was on the edge of the lake. English professors began appearing, mostly ladies. They had dangling earrings, and once again numbers came into my dream. There was English 309 A, English 219, etc. and each one had a professor appearing for it. I was awakened at this point.
Interpretation
Much of this dream had faded. The great number of numbers appearing is interesting, but I cannot distinguish why. As a matter of fact, the whole symbolism of the dream is obscure to me.

I can't remember enough of the first part of the dream to record how I got there, but I found my self walking down a hallway, dimly lit, trying to get out of a saw mill I think it was. I tried first one door and then another that led off from the hall and each time I looked out to find a long drop to the earth below, thirty feet or so. Finally I returned to one door and then decided to descend by way of an unloading machine parked there. It had a series of wheels at one end, covered by huge rubber tires in groups of three's. By jumping from one set to another I was able to get down. Several men stood and watched my progress, I thanked them for letting me use the machine and then walked into a valley where I entered a hotel verandah. Here I found several friends (girls) of mine who asked me to stay a while, but not having been home for a while, I refused. I then found my self emerging on C-- H-- and started walking up F-- B-- to go home.

I dreamed there were hundreds of airplanes flying over our house, which was transferred into a new setting. I stood over a broad field to watch the planes. They were a very peculiar shape which I can't describe but can draw--. I guess I can't even do that but can still see them there in my minds eye. They were yellow and, black and flew en masse in a seemingly unending supply. I remember vaguely that a man jumped out of one of them and parachuted down to earth. I approached him when he landed. He stuck his foot through the silk and tore the chute badly. I think I contemplated that the material would have been nice for a nightgown or slip.
Interpretation
I think the shape of the planes was somewhat influenced by some pictures I saw very recently in Life of the new Navy or Army plane with the peculiar shape. I can't account for the dream however, aside from this.

I was lying on my stomach, dressed in blue jeans and a shirt in the hallway leading to the kitchen. The phone is in the hallway and I was with two others, a boy and another girl. The boy was on the phone and was blocking the way to the lavatory. I had an intense urge to defecate but felt considerable embarrassment in going into the bathroom at this time. Consequently, I held down my urge as long as possible, and then went into my pants. It was hard enough to remain intact and when I got up I went upstairs to dispose of it in the bathroom up there. The bathtub was full of water which somebody had left after bathing. 1 wanted to take a bath but felt that I needed clean water. The rest of the dream fades at this point. Somehow I took my bath and I believe I changed the water.
Interpretation
The defecation referred to is totally undisguised, obviously. I have found that just prior to my menstrual period I have a dream which is undisguised in a similar manner, although never before of defecation. Freud claims that dreaming of clothes means nakedness. This could be a possibility in this case because of the circumstances involved. The bath water is no doubt a leftover from two nights before when a friend of mine spent the night. We both wanted baths and while she was taking hers I considered the possibility of using her water in case the hot water was all gone. I did not do this however, as I would rather take a cold bath and feel cleaner.

I dreamed I was back in W-- but the college was on the M-- campus. I drove up in front of a barber shop where the sidewalk curb had painted "student parking." I parked there and went into the barber shop. I almost walked into a stag room on my way past the door. Then I walked through a passage way and ended in a large stadium. I was with some girl of my own age (don't remember who) and we went up to the top of a flight of stairs and looked out over a vast stadium in which the M-- D-- festival was being enacted. This festival (in W--) is written by a student and is usually a take-off on some characters like "The Wizard of Oz" or "Mother Goose." There were many people dancing and running through their exercises. When we left there I took my little sister to the school bathroom. This was in Junior High School. I remember this because I had taken her to the boys bathroom. I can't remember what we did from there but we neither of us seemed too excited.
Interpretation
Just before I went to sleep I was thinking about the M-- D-- F-- and just what I could think up to write one myself. This I believe to be the basis for that part of the dream. As for the bathroom, we had discussed my father's mistake in going into the ladies' restroom one time when out of town that evening. This may be the foundation for that part of the dream.

I don't remember how I got where I was, but I was standing beside a lake wearing my sister's best black print dress. I wanted to get across to the other side of the lake and was marooned on an island of some kind. In order to get where my friends were it became necessary to swim across. The first part of the water I went into was thick with slime and muck. As I got toward the middle though the water was clearer and rinsed me clean. I was worried about ruining the dress, but when I came out of the water it seemed to be all right and somehow didn't stick to me.
Interpretation
The dirty lake was inspired by my thoughts of a similar nature about the pond where the canoe tilts were held. The dress is one I have worn on occasion and my sister had it on the day before the dream. The night I dreamed this, I had seen a movie short on a fisherman who was pulled under water and went walking about the lake floor seeing other people. I noticed that none of their clothes stuck to them, and remarked about it.

I dreamed I was going out to dinner and went with some of my college friends, girls. We ended up at a restaurant on the outskirts of some town. It had a brown stucco front and several archways going all across the front. Over each was the name of the seven dwarfs and Snow White. Then there were three more door ways, or arches with names over them, but I can't remember which ones they were. We went in and ordered steaks but L-- was the only one that could have one, the rest were all gone. The rest of this part of the dream is a bit vague. Shortly after, I returned to this same restaurant with the boy I used to go with. I went out to the kitchen this time and took a steak out of the icebox to cook it myself. After this the dream fades again, but every time I dream of this boy I get great feelings of antagonism toward him and have awful urges to hit him.

My husband (age 20 & really my husband) and I were watching a football game which was being played on the sandy beach of the lake. My mother and father were there too, sitting nearer the lake than we were. We left for a few minutes and when we got back there was nothing left of the football field, the football team, or the spectators. I was scared to death and finally saw a boy riding on a bicycle. I asked him what had happened and he said that a wave had washed everything away. I felt so badly because my mother and father were among the lost.

I was traveling somewhere by bicycle with several other girls and somehow I got separated from them -- it seems to me that people that knew me kept stopping me and asking me questions, thus detaining me from catching up with my friends. I remember riding up out a hill with a building on it and seeing a trail going into the woods. I started to ride onto this train but realized that it would soon be dark (it was 5:45) and I didn't want to be lost in the woods after dark - so I returned to the hill with a very frustrated feeling at having lost my friends. I remember having said "hello" to my sister as I was trying to catch up -- she didn't detain me, though.

I cannot remember the details of the dream except that my mother had to go to jail for something that I knew she hadn't done. It was about 6 o'clock in the morning and she wanted to drive to jail alone but I insisted that I'd take her. She felt very badly about having to go to jail, and I tried to comfort her. When I went out to get the car, I couldn't back out of the driveway because a black car was parked horizontally across the driveway. I wasn't very worried about my mother having to go to jail because I was positive she was innocent.

I was at a big meeting of Catholics in a huge house in the country, and I didn't want to talk to so many people so I shut myself in a bedroom and took a nap. Then it seemed that people had been asking me for money for one thing and another until I had none left--I was mad about that. I went downstairs and on the way to the stairs I remember seeing a woman at a switchboard and a man on an elevator. When I got to the bottom of the stairs there were so many people there and when I saw my husband coming down the stairs, I decided to play games with him and hide. But he went home without me, and I started walking home on the country road in the dark. Finally, someone in a coach pulled by horses picked me up and it was raining. Then I woke up.

I interpret the idea of the Catholics taking my money as originating from my hearing older people talk of how much money the Catholic Church asks its members to give. Otherwise, I don't understand the dream, except that I often don't feel like mixing and talking with a lot of people.

I was at a summer resort where there was one big cottage and some desolated ruins of cottages. I was with women and girls only. The place was on the sea and was quite hard to get to (through dense woods, etc.). One day a couple of us took a walk down the road (away from the sea) and came to a road going off to the right where a lot of surly looking men were having an argument over an automobile. I remember seeing a big, tall colored man there, in particular.

My mother, father, sister and I went over to England where we had a big house with about 6 bedrooms. I started going around with Princess Elizabeth and since she was not supposed to associate with commoners, she had to sneak in and out whenever we were together. Then I met her brother, and we liked each other a lot. He wanted to marry me but I hadn't forgotten about my present husband back in the U.S. I don't remember, but I think we were engaged then. Anyway, I knew that if I married the Prince, he would be disliked by many and I would be in society for the rest of my life -- what happened, I don't know because I woke up. I remember talking to someone about the ocean trip -- I said that I hadn't gotten seasick on the large ship we sailed on -- this "someone" said she had sailed on a smaller ship and got terribly seasick. Also, I remember talking to several people about the food in England --I was shocked because I was getting plenty of food to eat and I had heard so many stories about the poor supply of food in England. Incidentally, I also remember telling someone in England that the Prince looked just like my husband fiance then) -- Also I hated to hurt my fiance and I thought that he might have been afraid of something like this happening when I left the U.S.

I was in a house with a lot of girls--it was on a main street where street cars ran. Across the street were four men and one of them knocked another one down and shot him. The men ran toward the house where we were and we were scared to death. Then two policemen were there protecting us from the bandits who had run around the house somewhere. The policemen had their pistols all ready to shoot if one of the bandits should appear. There was a street car waiting to leave right beside our house, but it wasn't going near my home. A friend of one of the girls picked her up, and I begged the girl to take me home but she wasn't going my way either. I kept trying to call my Dad to ask him to come after me. The policeman left and there were only two of we girls left in the house--we were afraid to go out on the street and wait for a street car for fear the men would return. There was a drunk under a back window of the house, and we hung out the window and tried to keep him quiet so he wouldn't attract the bandits attention to the house.

Somehow, there were several children in the dream, not mine, but someone else's. I cant remember how they fit in.

We were eating dinner at-the dormitory. The menu was baked beans mixed with spaghetti, cole slaw, and rolls. The waitress was giving out extra rolls, and gave three of the girls at our table four or five extra ones, putting them in their laps. The rest of us were angered at this, for that left only a few for the rest of us. When the plate was then passed to me, I took two rolls, feeling a little guilty but rationalizing by observing that they were small. Later, one of the girls who had received the extra rolls said that she didn't know why the waitress had given her so many, and that she didn't think she could eat them. We continued to eat the rest of the meal, and just as I was chewing the last mouthful, I woke up. Also, somewhere in the course of the dream, I was telling one of the persons on the news staff of the R-- how to go about chasing stories that hadn't come in by the deadline, I told this to him in greater detail than I remember thinking it out consciously.
Interpretation
The part of the dream about the R-- was probably brought on because I had been worried the day before as to how I could finish everything I had to do in the next few days, including quite a bit of work on the R--. The rest of the dream is meaningless to me.

His son, a member of our young people's group at home and several other members of that group were also there. It was a large dinner.

I was crossing a busy intersection and saw a little boy standing in the middle of the street.

His mother took the boy and carried him. He was also leading a little girl by the hand. The father was impatient to get going and said something to the effect of "Come on, M--, we haven't got all day." Neither of them seemed concerned that their child had been in a dangerous situation.

I was apparently visiting another college. I don't know which one or why. For some reason I was in one of the dormitories, trying to find out what the rules were regarding late nights. Nobody seemed to be around. Finally, I found a girl who was sleeping but who awakened as soon as I came into her room. I apologized for waking her and asked her about the late nights. I don't remember what her answer was, but somehow it came out that this dorm was named M. H., at which I was very pleased, since that is the dorm I live in. As I was leaving her room, I remembered that I had her scissors in my hand (I don't remember why). I took them back, assured her I hadn't meant to steal them, and went out.

I was driving a car along 105th Street and wanted to make a stop at the intersection so that my dad and mother could get in the car. I couldn't bring it to a stop however and had to go on through a red light. When I finally stopped at the next street, 3 men were near the car. They were all strangers to me and looked about 30 years old. There was a mutual attraction between one of the men (a blonde) and myself and somehow I felt I was in love with him. He offered to drive back a street for me. My parents came up to me to drive the car back but I told them to leave us and went with him. Later, when coming up my driveway, this man's wife came out of my house and on seeing me began screaming and having hallucinations that worms were on her. Her husband and I took her to the hospital and secretly I hoped she wouldn't get well so that her husband and I could be together but I also felt terrible at thinking these thoughts.
Interpretation
This could be an inner desire to meet a man with whom I immediately fall in love and don't have to develop this love. It seems too that I am not going to allow my parents to interfere as they might have done in the past. I am happier without them, in this dream. But probably I have the feeling that anything good that happens to me has its drawbacks for the wife enters. She either becomes ill at seeing her husband with me or else has been sick and that is why he goes out with others. I know I wish her to die and yet I try to hide these thoughts because actually she or any other wife has first choice to a husband. Somehow I feel I am the loser again.

I was fixing my hair while 3 of my girlfriends were waiting for me and coaxing me to hurry. We started to go to a Sociology class. We climbed many steps and didn't know where to turn or go. (Each of the girls were approximately my age and were girls with whom I attend school.)
Interpretation
I interpret this dream as referring to M-- and its sororities. The Sociology class to me stands for the Sorority system, and the steps which we climbed stands for the different Sorority functions we attended.

There was a group of fellows and girls about 20 years of age. They seemed to be in a sort of church or temple among older men and women who were there to watch a ceremony of some sort. A man, who was the head of the place, came up to our group and without saying a work we knew it was our turn to die next. He took us downstairs to a small room in which there was a table, a mirror and some chairs. We asked for some leniency because of our young age. He said all right for a while. Then we found out we were already dead and, those upstairs were mourning for us and going through a ceremony. We still felt very much alive but somehow guilty and depressed. Later he came in again and told us our time was up and that we would have to be put in our coffins. I remember being transferred to New York with a boyfriend of mine, sitting in a sidewalk cafe with him but hearing no sounds and then being transferred back to the coffin.
Interpretation
It seems to me that this is some sort of a death wish either on my part or a wish that others would die. It also seems to give the idea of death being actually half-alive aware of what is going on but not being able to explain to the mourner.

She gave me the keys to her office drawer to get a cap. Instead I found a salad of tomatoes and lettuce which I brought to an unknown prof. for lunch. I watched another man and him eat by a window. Miss S-- then ran up to me to ask me where I had left the keys. I had left them in the drawer.

I was walking down K-- when two men passed by in a truck. A small boy began to annoy me. He screamed and kicked and said he would only be satisfied if I would give him my leopard-trimmed dress coat which I was wearing. The two men tried to tear him away from me but I finally had to give in and give him the coat. He took it and gleefully threw it in the gutter. I proceeded to a dinner with the two men. It was at a large beautiful home. The little boy was there too.

I was at a house party. An old boyfriend of mine was there. We were playing games in one room. He was with another crowd in another room. There was a commotion and a man lay dead on the floor. My old boyfriend lay down on a bed in one of the bedrooms and felt miserable. I tried to comfort him. Two boyfriends of his tried to talk him into going to a very good show in town. I talked to him again but it didn't look as if he were paying any attention to us. The two fellows and myself started to the show. As we walked along the street, he caught up to us, handed me a bunch of pansies and said "Here's a dollars' worth of posies." He took my arm and we all walked on together.

I was at a party in a very beautiful, spacious house, given by my down-stairs neighbor's sister and her husband. When I mentioned that my watch had been given to me upon graduation from Junior-High School, the host brought out a watch and gave it to me. I was very thrilled. It was only when I got home that I noticed it was as large as a saucer and was held very clumsily to my wrist by a rubber-band. Then I realized that no one gives anything away for nothing.

There were two girls and myself sitting around a table in H-- Hall. We were watching a fellow and girl come down the steps. Each of us knew the fellow and one by one we told each other of our experiences with him. Each story was similar to the other. There was a fourth vacant chair and we expected the girl he was with to fill it.
Interpretation
I went all summer with the fellow in the dream. There are two other girls I know who have gone with him in the past and have had the same outcome - when he feels both are getting too serious, he stops dating the girl because he can see himself with a girlfriend but not a wife. Now he is going with a fourth girl who probably we all unconsciously hope or expect to end up the same way as we did.

A friend and I were driving in a car with a fellow we knew. He got out of the car to see about a new one. Next I found my uncle driving the car. He also got out to see about buying a new one. I took over the wheel. It started to rain. A colored family got in for they knew I was going in their direction. As I drove men kept popping up from man-holes and trying to attract my attention. I drove down the street and turned into a garage so as to make a turn. No one was in the car with me and I couldn't stop it except to put my foot out and stop it like I would a bicycle. I got out of the car and before I knew what was happening, some men came and drove the car down to a lower garage. I couldn't get the workers to return it to me for they were watching a clock and on the stroke of 5 p.m. they dashed out of the garage and left me all alone.
Interpretation
I had been driving with a friend and a fellow that day. He stopped all along the way to look at used and new cars. I felt a terrific urge to drive that day but actually although I know the rules, I have never had the experience of driving. My not being able to stop the car may have shown my inward insecurity about driving.

I found myself in my kitchen with a few of my girlfriends, but the only one I could recognize was one red-headed one. They were telling me to hurry with my breakfast as it was already 8:05 a.m. and the red-headed girl said that we had to leave at exactly 8:10 a.m. if we wished to make our 9:00 a.m. class. I was in a terrible state for I knew I could never possibly make it as I still had to get dressed.
Interpretation
That morning I was very tired and heard my mother calling but couldn't get up. My mother had been telling me that it was already five after eight and I know I have to leave between 8:10 and 8 15 in order to meet this red-headed friend in my dream.

Interpretation
I think this may mean he desires to have a sexual relationship with me while I do not want one with him. For, I went out with him once and found him to be very vicious and sadistic--he was always pinching my arm or scratching my arm so that it actually pained. I asked him to stop which he did.

I dreamt I was sitting in my living-room when a married girlfriend of mine came in with a date who was not her husband. She seemed very gay and happy and said she was going to go out with this fellow just as a lark.
Interpretation
This friend of mine married her husband after about a month. She wasn't in love with him at the time but talked herself into it because she felt there wouldn't be any men and she wanted to be married at the age of 20 in order to get ahead of a cousin of hers whom she didn't like. My feeling is that she is still not sure whether or not she did the right thing and would like to have a chance to go out with others to make sure she actually is happy with her husband.

Many people including my family and friends were sitting on very comfortable chairs and couches in a huge, beautiful room with columns and pillars all around the room. Straight ahead was a section with steps leading up to a space occupied by a very long desk. Seated at the desk was a man dressed in a judges' robes. A friend turned to me and told me to notice that the man in the judges' robes was a fellow I was dating. Then at the other end of the room music started playing. This fellow in the judges' robes came down, stood directly in front of me and asked me to dance with him.
Interpretation
I think the courtroom scene came to me because I was reading about the acquittal of 28 men who were accused of lynching a Negro in the South. The pillars and columns were a result of my taking an art appreciation course and having to notice such things. The fellow I dated dressed as a judge seemed to represent the idea that actually he is the one who has to make the decision as to whether or not he wants me and his asking me to dance represents the marriage proposal which unconsciously I want, I think.

It was about myself doing mathematical problems. It was on an examination. There were about 5 or 6 problems and I felt that if I was only able to do just a couple I would fail as there were only so few. Can't remember exactly what type of problems, but they seemed to be long involved ones where there was large amount of multiplying and dividing. I worked the first two or so out satisfactory, but then I wasn't able to do the rest. Could feel myself becoming anxious and tense. I looked at my watch, it was almost 3 o'clock. Class would be over soon and I had only done a few. In my dream I felt as if I was facing the same thing again, that is I could only go so far in some thing, but never completely work it through. Don't remember what happened from there, whether I handed the paper in or not. It did move out of the room. I was in a class room, to a place by myself - Cannot identify any other person.
Interpretation
While on duty in the hospital yesterday I had an occasion to work some dosage problems, However, I did work it out satisfactory, but only after a second attempt. Had the same sense of being uncomfortable, but not quite as intense as in the dream. Think perhaps this might be one of the factors which caused me to dream about solving problems. Perhaps the uncomfortable and tense feeling I had earlier in the day still remained with me and when I was not able to consciously suppress it, it again came out. For some reason for which I can't explain I felt in my dream the way I felt about an examination I took in German last June, discouraged and tense.

This dream took place in a hospital, I don't think I was aware of the exact hospital. I was taking care of my closest friend a young married girl of 22 yrs. I went to plug the light into the wall socket, but before I could water started flowing out of it. It began coming faster and flooding the room. I was unable to stop it. I went out to the desk, called some one to come to repair it. When I returned to the room the water seemed to be a couple of feet high so I moved the bed out of the room down the hall by the desk, but the water seemed to continue to flow down the hall - What happened after that I can't remember Don't know if the water was turned off or not.
Interpretation
Recently I had taken care of my friend while she underwent an operation. I had not seen her since she has returned home from the hospital, and I have been wondering how she is. Also on the day one of the pipes had been leaking gas, and just before retiring that night we had been discussing the event because at the time it created quite a disturbance. I believe that my dream was more or less a continuation of my thoughts during the day.

This dream was very vague and confused. I can't tell exactly where it took place. It seemed to be in a basement of some building. In this room they were selling eggs - There seemed to be many regular egg boxes piled up in rows in the room. I was apparently watching some man, whom I can't identify, gathering the eggs. He was just about to take a egg when one of the chickens pecked at his hand which caused it to bleed. I don't recall any thing else that occurred after that.

In this dream I was in a large room, which was filled with people, it seemed as if it was some sort of a rally. I remember borrowing a white soft sweater from one of the girls, who is about 24 yrs old and also a nurse. Then I went over and sat on the floor, and I found that I able to sit with my legs crossed which I can't do in actuality because of a congenital condition, and I was so amused and surprised -- I kept telling every one and showing them how I could sit. In the dream some one was displaying objects which could be sold, for some purpose or another. She held up a pair of stockings, nylons, and I remember every one made a rush to get a pair. But I did not go, but remained sitting.
Interpretation
That same evening I remember reading a notice in the bulletin board about one of the students was a distributor for hose for some company. Perhaps that had some thing to do - the part about the stockings also as a child growing up I have always felt disturbed about the fact I could never sit like the other children, and as I was on the heavy side I thought it was because I was over weight; which I have found out it was not due to that. Recently I have been losing weight, and I think the old unconscious idea which was associated with this over weight has been aroused lately because of this.

It was raining in my dream and I was coming out of the hospital going over to another building. I remember that as I was running across I noticed the long line of people standing in line, out in the rain waiting to be seen by the doctor in the out patient Dept. Some were older men and women, and as I entered the hospital I remember feeling upset and despairing about seeing them out in the rain, waiting patiently. I thought that certainly other arrangements could be made for these people.
Interpretation
I have recently had more contact with the hospital, which I haven't had for some time and I often times have to go through the clinic to go home at night and I see patients waiting patiently and hopefully. It usually leaves me uneasy, for a line of thought about their social and economic and health status goes through my mind and I feel often times that life is so hard and such a struggle for some.

I went to the store to buy a newspaper, which cost three cents. Had a five dollar bill with me, but I needed the change. The person who waited on me apparently couldn't make change for he keep over charging me. I keep insisting that the paper was only three cents, that he wasn't giving my correct change. I was growing impatient as I was suppose to have an appointment at 8 o'clock. I don't remember who the appointment was with however. It was growing very late, and getting dark outside. I remember calling to another person, apparently the owner of the store to come over & show this boy how to count. He told me the reason for the mistake was that you had to pay for the service besides the paper, and so it really wasn't a mistake at all. The last thing I remember is that I left the store without the paper, already late for my appointment and very upset.

This dream was a short one, but one which made me very upset. In this dream I was wheeling my father in a wheel chair. We were in a hospital and I was showing him about. I kept saying that you must get well real quick so that I could come home and take care of him. I started to cry when I was looking at him. I remember how pleased I was when I was showing him about and introducing him. Yet at the same time I had the feeling of sorrow. I woke up feeling terribly depressed and I kept seeing him most of the day.

r had taken my Godmother's daughter, who is 17 and like a sister to me, to some sort of a lesson & while waiting for her I thought I would talk with one of the advisors at this building. I believed it to be like a placement service. I went into a room and found a man well dressed who spoke like a physician instead of a placement advisor. He began questioning me about my feelings, I became afraid for he said I would need a series of treatment which would be expensive. I told him the reason I came was that I wanted to find some sort of part time work. He didn't seem to understand, & he told me to take G. home but to come back because I was a sick person. I hurried out, but didn't have any thought of returning. It was raining when we went out side - as we walked along I noticed that this mob was following us. I saw a street car coming so I told G. to on to my house, that I was going to take the street car & go to her house. I felt that I must talk to her mother about what had happened. However when I was on the car I found that this person was there also. I had forgotten to get a transfer so I went back and obtained one.

I stopped at some sort of gym department to see about working part time. The instructor was a older woman but seemed very kind. She asked me if I could sing. I told her that I couldn't too well, but that I knew quite a bit about music. She called in a couple of girls to listen to me sing, and decide if I could. I remember trying a number of different songs, but I only knew small snatches of them. After I sang they all took a vote. Each one said that I only rated about 50%. On this basis the teacher decided that I should not have the job. She was very nice about it; and I thank her for at least considering me and went out.

I was coming home from church and it seemed as if I was with F. who is thirty nine years of age and with whom I used to go with, but whom I don't see any longer. It seemed he stopped to get some ice cream and I took the opportunity to go home without him. I think I felt that I didn't want him to come home with me. When I got home I took my father out to the porch. It seemed as if I just picked him up in my arms, he was so little. After a while F. came up to the house and I introduced him to my father. I felt as if I didn't want F. to see that my father was so ill. Then F. took the ice cream to the ice box. I told him I would be in in just a few minutes, but I didn't. When I did go back there was a note from him saying he had gone. I remember my father asking me if I was interested in him; he hoped not because he seemed too old for me - I assured him that I wasn't interested in him.
Interpretation
That perhaps I felt guilty going with a older person, and I didn't want anyone to know that I was going with this older man. As a matter of fact I did feel that he was too much older than me, and that I was turning to him because I had lost my father and needed someone to take his place - He did ask me to marry him, but I told him that I felt that perhaps we shouldn't see each other any more.

In this dream I was at some sort of cottage when a number of others were there also. It was some sort of a party, and we were playing cards - Can't remember if we were playing any thing special. Everyone was laughing and singing. I felt that they should pay more attention to the game instead of fooling around. Suddenly I got up and said that if they couldn't do any thing else then I might as well not play.

In this dream I was working on two huge size pieces of paper. They were so large that I couldn't reach across them put I had to walk around them. They were both mapped out in various squares. It seemed as if I was trying to make an assignment of patients and I kept placing numbers in the squares, but then would erase it and place it in another place. Others around seemed to be giving me advise where I should assign various people. I began to get discouraged, I had holes in the paper from erasing so much, and it seemed as if I couldn't make the assignment complete in time it should be.

In this dream I was Skiing, yet I didn't seem to be at any Skiing resort. In fact I seemed to be around here. There was considerable amount of snow and there seemed to be high hills. I was with a woman doctor who I have frequent contact with. She went before me, and she fell. When I came down I asked if she had broken any thing and she replied she thought she had broken her hand. When we looked at her hand one of the bones was bend up, she laughed and said perhaps she could push it down which she proceeded to do. However we both decided that she should go to the hospital which we did - Later on I dreamed that someone had a little puppy dog - I don't recall who the friend one. It was a small thing with hair which covered its eyes. The front left foot was missing, and when I remarked of this the person said that it didn't stop him from getting around because he had an extra foot at the side. When I looked further there was a small foot by which he could certainly get around with - To demonstrate to me he ran quickly up the stairs.

I was in the basement of the Church of the Covenant where a number of young people were gathered. They were planning to go to the ball game. All the girls seem to have dates except me, and I was hoping that perhaps some one might ask me. I went upstairs and there a boy asked me if this was where he was suppose to meet for the ball game. I said it was & asked him if he was going. He said that he wasn't sure at this time. I don't recall that I knew him, he had red hair - and was a clean cut nice looking fellow. He was reading a book - I asked him what is was about and he told me it was about philosophy. We seemed to stand there talking for quite some time. I kept thinking and hoping that perhaps he would ask me to the game - I don't remember how it ended, but I don't think he ever did ask me.
Interpretation
Earlier in the evening one of the girls was saying that a fellow she knew wanted a date as he was new in C. & didn't know many girls. She told us how nice he was, for she had known him before. I thought to myself when she was talking about him that I wouldn't be the one to go out with him, and if I did it probably would be for one time only for I'm not to at ease with the opposite set, and feel very tense when I am with them, although I wish I wasn't so.

In this dream I was in a class room situation. I was standing before the class giving a talk. The subject concerned the problem of learning to speak before a group. I was saying that I had read or been acquainted with a boy who was very insecure about reciting in front of a class, but made himself talk before the class. I told this class that I had felt the same way, and that I had to force myself to stand before a class and do public speaking. As I was talking I could feel myself completely relaxed and very much at ease. There was a discussion following this in which I took a very active part.
Interpretation
That unconscious and conscious I would like to be able to stand before group and do public speaking without the tension & embarrassment which I usually feel.

I dreamed that my mother & father were living and that I was at home with them. However my father was ill in bed. I could see him sitting up in bed, then out in the sun porch. He kept asking me when he would get well, & if he had to continue to take the "shots. " - He was getting medication for lues. I tried to explain that it would be necessary for along period of time, but not to become discouraged that is was a long treatment but would be helpful to him. I asked him how he thought he had become infected & that did he have any idea how long ago it was. He seemed very surprised that I had any idea what it his illness was & he asked me if I knew. I said yes, that I wasn't a child. He began to talk of a time when he went out with some of his friends about eight years ago--however I can't seem to remember any thing more. I did feel however, that although my mother was in the dream she didn't enter into it actively.
Interpretation
Yesterday in class we were talking of the treatment of diabetes & the necessity to take insulin - by hypodermic continuously. This I believe caused the return of my memory when not so very long along my father was taking medication in such a way, for lues. It was some thing that I found very hard to realize existed & I never really could make myself believe it true, & I have some very unpleasant associations with it.

It seems like I had given a nutrition test and one of the girls, who is about 20 yrs old and a physical education major, had taken it and had not passed. She asked me if there wasn't some thing she could do about it. I told her that if she could give the seven essential food substances I would pass her. She had a lot of difficulty trying to list them. I was really very surprised and couldn't understand why she should be having so much trouble. She named "buttermilk" and I asked "what is wrong with whole milk?" She finally did name every thing.

I seem to be at the dormitory which I am now staying. There seemed to be some sort of a fight going on - all the girls were fighting, can't seem to recall who or what they were fighting I remember I was sitting at the top of the stairs after the fight was over and one of my present teachers, who is a nurse about 38 yrs old came along. I seemed to be thanking her for helping us, she seemed glad that she could have helped. I remember that many of the girls had their faces cut & clothes torn.

I was again living at the nurse's home, but there didn't seem to be any one there that I knew. It seemed as if I was looking for my pearls which I had lost. I had just come off the elevator when I saw part of them on a table in the hallway. It seemed as if there was only the two ends and when I tied them together and put them on they were much to short to wear. I began looking all around again, and then I found the middle part. All the pearls were present and I immediately fastened them together and wore them.
Interpretation
I have just recently lost my string of pearls which I value a great deal. The evening before the dream I spent considerable amount of time hunting for them without results, and I felt quite upset about it. I believe that I was still trying to seek them, & that this dream might be a wish for fulfillment.

It seems like I was at a lake. I can remember I was sitting on the beach with my shoes & stockings off. The water kept coming higher up on to the beach and I had to keep moving my shoes up. I don't think I was by myself yet I can't remember who else was there. Next I seem to be on the street where I lived as a child. I was just walking along when my closest friend's father called me over to read a letter from his wife, who is dead now. It seems like she was over in Scotland, her home. The letter wasn't written on regular paper, but I don't remember what it was written on, or what it contained. However, I think the letter contained pleasant news.
Interpretation
One thing keeps coming back that happened during this confused dream is that I keep going over the words, most precious days or things in your whole life. I dreamt some thing about it, but I can't remember what it was. Also I received a letter from an old boy friend of mine, saying he would see me soon, however I can't connect it with any of the other parts of the dream.

I was suppose to meet my Godmother's daughter who is seventeen downtown at 4 PM. I apparently left the house in plenty of time, but when walking to the bus I kept stumbling and it seemed like I couldn't walk. I saw a number of buses go by and I thought I probably would have to wait a long time now that so many buses had gone by. I was up to the corner finally when I saw the bus coming slowly yet when I started to hurry the bus began to go faster, and I kept running and calling for it to stop, but it didn't.

I was at a big celebration on an isolated island. Several of my college friends were there as well as many small children. Everybody was singing and continually excusing themselves to go to the bathroom....
I climbed a coconut tree on which there were only two small coconuts and these were covered with small white spiders. I came down out of the tree and told my father about the coconuts. He wanted to see for himself, so he reached to the top of the tree and bent it down to the ground....

I became transformed into the figure head of a small boat in which there were two passengers. We were sailing home--around and round in circles. I would sink under the water and then my passengers would. This continued until I was awakened by the alarm clock.

There were both sexes in the dream--the college students about my age and the small children within a 5-10 year age range.

I came out of a store to find that a policeman (about 40 years old) was putting a ticket on my father's car. I got in the car behind my father's in order that I might drive it away before the policeman placed a ticket on it. The policeman got on his motorcycle and pushed the car backwards. I immediately moved forward and crashed through a pink light. Then I found myself trying to drive the car down a narrow aisle in the 5 & 10 cent store. A cashier asked me to leave and I did. I got out on the sidewalk and the car was transformed into a bicycle which I rode down the sidewalk. I passed an Army Surplus Store outside of which four girls (in their 20's I would say) were modeling army fatigue outfits.
Interpretation
One Wednesday, September 28, I drove a friend to the police station so that he could pay a parking ticket fine. This incident probably explains why I dreamed about getting a parking ticket. When driving it is difficult for me to judge how narrow the driving space is. I guess the 5 & 10 cent store aisle would represent a very narrow space through which I was trying to drive.

I was shopping with my friend (male--age 23). We were standing in front of a store. He was giving me some money so I could go in a grocery store to buy a few things (can't recall what). He remarked that we should both try not to spend so much of his money I was rather surprised. I went into the store but could not bring myself to spend any of his money. So I went out of the store. In order to reach the sidewalk I had to walk through a field of weeds and high grass. When I reached the walk I saw that the parking meter for the space we had parked in was not registering. I put a penny in the meter and started to walk home having decided not to wait for my friend.

It was an hour before my sister's (age 22) wedding. I was all ready dressed in my bridesmaid dress. I kept wandering around and my dress fit loosely and was getting wrinkled and dirty. I saw the bride in back of a house--it was not my sister but a friend from home (age 24-female). I wandered around some more--The time went so slow. Then I saw the bride sitting on a rack all by herself--this time it was a sorority sister of mine (age 22). She had a terrible rash on her face. Then I was on an elevator with an usher whom I did not know. We got off the elevator and many many people standing outside a big building. Then I saw my sister. She was not dressed in her wedding dress but in her "going away outfit." At that moment another friend (age l9--female) danced by in a white dress with red flying panels which she held at arms length. Then I noticed that I had forgotten my gold slippers and my mother (age 45) was just telling my sister to drive me home after them when I woke up.

I came home from school for the first time in some two weeks (although school seemed to be within walking distance) to find that we had moved into a new house. It was a very modern, spacious house. It was so big I didn't even get a chance to see it all. I went down to the basement and found my mother (age-45) ironing. There were big picture windows in the basement. I said good-by to my mother and started off to school. I found another flight of stairs leading up from the basement into a passageway (with a glass roof) leading to the living room. I went outside and it was raining very hard. I ran to the corner and stepped into the doorway of a store. I fell down and got mud on my raincoat.

I was walking on E--- at W--- Park at night. I had on my bridesmaid dress (which I wore at the wedding of my sister). Suddenly a strange man flashed a light in my face and laughed. Then he started chasing me and I ran into a dingy bar. There were many men at the bar and it was very noisy and smoky. I didn't know what to do.... Then I was in a designers shop. My gown had been ruined in some way and three women were making me a new one just like my old. I kept worrying about the time because it seemed as if I should be at the wedding. No one would let me call my parents and I didn't know where I was....
Then I was with my cousin (female-age 5) in a small room--I don't know where. I left and went outside to a parking lot where I found my parents (both 45 yrs. old). Then my cousin came running out and she was crying very hard because she thought she had gotten separated from me. I felt very bad for having left her....

Then a friend of mine (female-age 20) appeared in my newly made dress. I was disappointed because it was a dull brown whereas the original had been a beautiful orange color. I said "Do you get to have the dress after the wedding?" She said "Yes."

We followed the passageway until we came to an open room. Several men popped up from behind objects(with rifles.) and we were stopped. Then two girls (probably about 25 years old) came in with the leader (male) of the gang who was fat and about 35-40 yrs. old. My friend was taken away and I was led into a waiting room where I sat with the two girls and a man. Eventually another girl came out of the room adjoining the waiting room and said it was my turn to go into the leader's bedroom... The scene changed to the hallway where we had originally entered.

I was in a car with my father and mother (both 45 years old) and one other person (perhaps my sister age 22 but I am not sure). We were passing a golf course. Suddenly my father started driving faster, explaining that he had seen a man just drive (hit) his golf ball and he was afraid it might hit one of the windows in our car. The next thing I knew was that the ball had come through the rear window and it hit me on the collar bone which immediately swelled up. Also much glass lodged in my neck. We started home so that I could be doctored. We had only gone a short distance when the bump on my collar bone disappeared and I seemed perfectly well....

Two girls and myself drove out of the city on a road on either side of which were beautiful wooded areas. We were going to a gas station to get the owner's advertisement to be put in the M--- annual. We by-passed the gas station and pulled into a private drive in order to turn around. The girl driving kept on the drive until we came to the house. (She thought it would be easier to turn around.) We stopped by the house which was located in a wooded area. The other girl (not driving) and myself got out and walked into the woods. Suddenly a big handsome man (about 40 yrs. old), presumably the owner of the house, appeared. He asked us what we were doing and we told him. Then he began telling us how someone had come into his woods and scared his pet frog. The frightened frog jumped into a small stream where he got caught on a jagged rock which slit his throat. The man moaned that the frog had died and would no longer warn the man at night if the woods were to catch on fire...

I was in a room above the garage in my home. The room was used for storage. I was attempting to clean it up and in a desk I found all my notebooks and school work from the time I was in grade-school. I also found some photographs of myself at Girl scout Camp when I was 12 years old. In these photographs I had on a striped bathing suit. I was enjoying myself while looking through all my old notebooks etc. Then I came across a piece of art paper upon which was pasted a stylized primitive figure. I was very surprised for this design was exactly like a design which I have been stenciling in my Related Arts course (in real life). I had a sense of guilt because I felt that I had copied a design.

Our dormitory (M--- H---) was having an exchange dinner with D--- fraternity. The procedure was not usual, for the boys came over separately instead of in a group. Also, it was a very crude affair for the boy and his date were not properly introduced. Furthermore, our housemother (age 50?) did not wait for all the guests to arrive but went on into the dining room with three girls and began eating.
I was sitting in the living room on a couch facing a card table. A member of the fraternity (age 26) whom I knew, was sitting at the card table eating a very frugal dinner. His date (age 17) came in from gym class and sat down with him. I thought it was very stupid that this fellow was matched with this freshman girl. I felt embarrassed because I sensed that he was having a horrible time. Neither was paying any attention to the other.

I finally got up and went into the dining room to eat.

I was dreaming that I got up on this Saturday morning in M--- Dormitory after the breakfast hour. So I went over to the C---D--- to get an orange so as to have some breakfast. On the way back I saw my friend's (male-age 23) friend (male-age 22) on his way to Saturday morning classes at D--- school. I suddenly realized that my friend was sleeping in a third floor room ( I live on the second floor) in the dormitory, and that he would be late to school if he didn't get up. But instead of waking him, I went directly to my room. There I commenced to undress while at the same I watched a very strange affair going on outside in front of the dormitory. It seemed as if a group of students were rehearsing for a play which they were going to give. There were several students, both boys and girls whom I knew, dressed up as the well-known "keystone cops." Then there was an old electric car in which sat another male student in an early 1900 costume. Also there was another girl in appropriate costume who kept running back & forth between the car and the policemen always pleading and falling down on her knees.
Eventually I heard a knock on my door and I knew it was my friend. He started to come in and I said "Wait until I get my pajamas on." He came in and I was very frightened, for, of course, no boys are allowed in dormitories other than in the main living rooms.

We sat down on the bed and he kissed me. I kept getting more afraid. I told him he would be late to class. So he decided to leave but I didn't know how he would get out without the housemother detecting that he had been in my room. I decided to go with him and so I opened the door of my room. Much to my surprise, the hallway had been transformed into a sidewalk and there were many men walking along in both directions. I was very relieved.

I was holding two cups and saucers belonging to my friend's mother (age 55). I walked into another room (the kitchen) and there I accidentally dropped the cups and saucers. They broke upon my bare feet and I had many cuts on my feet. The maid (who in real life is a worker in M--- dormitory-age 50?) was there and she gave me several pieces of chicken which I put on my feet to stop the bleeding. I walked back into the living room. My friend's father (age 55) had joined him and when I entered I was very embarrassed because I knew the father (who is an M. D.) would think me very foolish for putting chicken on my feet.

I was standing with my family (mother & father, ages 45 and sister, age 22) and several other unknown people by the runway of an airfield. We watched a very large airplane take off. The crewmen were sitting on the wings and not until the plane had taken off from the ground did they begin to crawl into the plane in single file. It seemed very dangerous. The plane did many loops and turns in the air and I was afraid it would crash. Then there were many miniatures of this large plane which would dive into the ground and then bounce back up into the air. Next a group of jet planes flew by. One of them crashed by my sister. The plane when it crashed turned into a toy airplane. Nevertheless everybody ran except my sister. The next thing I knew, my sister was blind and I felt that it were my fault. I felt very bad but I do not know why.

I was bicycling down a long, wide highway. There were many other people on bicycles too. There were many many stoplights--perhaps two within 10 feet of each other. I was striving to reach each of them when the light was green. But every time I would get to one it would turn orange or red and then I wouldn't know whether to go on through and then I would worry about being arrested. (although I sensed the change in color in the stop lights I did not see the colors in the dream)...
I was standing in a hallway in a dormitory ( I don't know what dormitory). I was helping a friend (female-age 22) find a hooped slip which she could wear under a formal. I found one in a drawer in the hallway. The hoop was made of dress hangers and it looked very nice. She was glad to get it.

I was walking along a street (I don't know where). I stopped as I saw a short distance in front of me a manhole with one of those wooden horses used by road workmen extending across it. A man was tied to it by his ankles and wrists much as a pig is tied for roasting. Suddenly there was a great cloud of smoke around the manhole and as I looked I saw that the man had been burned to death. One arm, his head and shreds of clothes remained on the wooden horse. It was hideous and as I looked away I saw two hospital attendants (males) approaching in the opposite direction. As they passed I saw two men lying on the stretcher side by side. I heard someone (I don't know from where) whisper "They are dead." It was such a nightmare that I woke up.

The dream began when I was standing in front of a large building at an intersection on S-- C-- A--. The next thing I knew, I was inside the building standing in front of the elevators and pushing the buttons which signaled for the elevators. However, in my dream these buttons now acted as a doorbell to my dentist's office on a floor above. Since there was no answer to the button which I rang, I assumed my dentist was out, and I left. I felt rather relieved that I didn't have to see him. I walked out of the building and this time, next to the building entrance, I noticed a movie theater. I stopped to look at the pictures posted on the billboard. I noticed that the people who were starred in this picture looked familiar. Then I realized that the stars of this movie were my mother and father-in-law. I looked at each picture carefully now. I noticed that in each picture, the expressions on the faces of my parents-in-law were different. In one picture they looked surprised, in another happy and in several they appeared to be scowling at each other and fighting with one another. My mother-in-law did not look like she does at the present time. In the dream she appeared as she did when she was much younger. I then remembered that my brother and his family lived in an apartment in this buildlng, and I decided to visit them. For some reason--what I don't remember--I could not visit them. Here the dream ended.
Interpretation
I do not have a dentist appointment in the immediate future, so I do not know exactly what prompted me to dream of it. However, I have a fear of going to the dentist and consider it an unpleasant "must." Therefore, the relieved feeling of not having to see him. My mother and father-in-law have not been on good terms with one another for some time now and I have seen somewhat concerned about it. I notice that most of the pictures portrayed scenes in which they were scowling at each other. Also, I recently saw a picture of my mother-in-law when she was young and was amazed at her youthful beauty. This very likely impresses me very much so that in this dream she appeared very lovely. I hsve no explanation for the decision to visit my brother and his family.

This dream concerns an artist friend of my husband's. He is an old friend, and he and my husband. have known each other since they were children. He is about 25 years old. The dream itself is short--only a fragment. In my dreams, I was this friend standing and looking over the shoulder of a fellow art student who was painting a picture. I felt rather puzzled at seeing him at art school and back in C--, as I knew he had graduated from art school this September and had received a position as a commercial artist in C-- to where he moved with his wife just several weeks ago. When I asked him why he was here, he said that he disliked C-- and his job and preferred going to school. For that reason he came back. I felt happy about the fact that he returned.
Interpretation
I feel this dream is significant because of what it represents. This boy and his wife were our dearest friends. When they left town, it affected. me for quite a while. The fact that he came back in my dream was a way of expressing an unfulfilled desire. (I wanted them to come back). Also, they had set out to find work. Our friend had finished school. The very fact that he came back to school here, and not, for example, to a job here, shows that school represents security to me. I felt happy because he came back to school. The prospect of leaving school represents a full adult life with added responsibilities. It is something I do not feel quite prepared for as yet.

This dream is merely a fragment, but it is all that I can remember. All that took place was in the home of my sister-in-law (my husband's brother's wife) who is 35 years old. My sister-in-law and I were standing in the bathroom and were looking the room over. My sister-in-law began explaining to me the details of how she planned to have the room remodeled. In my dream it seemed as though there were definite plans that were going to be carried through, immediately. All I remember seeing is the glass mirror of the medicine cabinet. In my dream however, the mirror appeared more metallic than glass. My sister-in-law explained that she was going to have this mirror extended in a modern curved line down to the bathtub. Then I remember seeing my sister-in-law's face very vividly. I was very much impressed by her plans, and just a little bit envious.
Interpretation
I had just heard, several days before this dream, that this very same sister-in-law bought a television set for her home. I am continually impressed by the standard of living she malntains, particularly since she lives slightly above her means and likes to identify with the socio-economic class considered slightly higher than hers. She is constantly improving the appearance of her home and enjoys fine things. I feel slightly envious of her and at the same time I am impreseed by the standard of living she attempts to maintain. Yet, her activlties do not affect me deeply. I think this dream is indicative of my feelings about her and her activities.

This dream was rather short and fragmentary. I was off in some strange land---the A-- or S--. Airplanes were roaring overhead and several soldiers in a foxhole surrounded by snow were reassuring me that these planes were not of the enemy. The enemy was a wicked old witch who was out to kill us, particularly me. I felt relieved at their reassurance. The next thing I knew, I was told the witch was pulled down into a whirlpool of snow and killed. I looked at the ground and saw the hole through which she sank.

This dream consisted merely of seeing one of my professors faces very close. He appeared to be smiling and very friendly and I had the feeling that he wished to help me through some difficulty which I had (what it was I don't remember). When I awoke, I had the feeling that this was part of a long dream with a series of events in them. For some reason this was all I could remember of it. I had a vague feeling that other students were standing around with me.

In this dream I remember hearing the news that my mother had died. I remember feeling very upset, at the news. I don't know who told me the news, but soon after I heard it, the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He called to tell me about my mother. When he spoke to me, I felt very sorry for him and suddenly pitied him because he would be alone. When he spoke of my mother, I thought of her and at this point had an intense emotional outburst of tears. Later I remember sensing a fear and dread of going to my mother's funeral. I did not wish to see her dead. I then visualized my mother's face before me with her eyes closed. It was very vivid.
Interpretation
Here is a classic illustration of the oedipus problem. It is difficult for me to say exactly what this dream means, but it is obvious to me that many of my unconscious feelings toward my parents came out here. Any hostility for my mother which I have was expressed in this death dream. The pity I felt for my father is significant of my feelings toward him. Pity for myself was also experienced and a lost feeling knowing my mother was gone. My hostility feelings toward my mother are never expressed directly. The anxious feeling in the dream--probably guilt feelings.

In this dream I discovered suddenly upon waking up from a sleep, that I was the mother of two baby boys whom I gave birth to at the same time. I remember feeling surprised at not remembering giving birth, but I seemed quite proud of being a mother. My mother then informed me that I was pregnant again, but the doctor who diagnosed me said he wasn't sure of this he had heard some noise in my stomach and for this reason felt I might be pregnant. I didn't experience any pain in this dream, but I remember going through the motions of being in pain, I couldn't walk well and I acted as tho I were very weak. I remember showing off the babies to people who came into the house.

In the window were some interesting shoes for women at bargain prices, my husband and I went in and I tried on the shoes.

I remember in this dream going to the tennis courts with my friend, but I do not remember playing tennis. The next thing I knew we were in a building with many people and we were holding our tennis raquets. I met my husband and we began to talk, when one of my professors approached us and appeared quite friendly and interested in my school work. He discussed my last paper with me and then we went into his offlce for a conference. I remember seeing three people leaving his office. He told me my grade which I was satisfied with, but he criticized my work in a beligerent manner and this made me quite unhappy. But I had the feeling, nonetheless, that he was pleased with my work.

I dreamt I was riding on a streetcar and was watching the conductor operate the car. I began to notice the lever which he turned when we rounded a bend. It soon felt as though I were operating the car with him. When we came to a sharp corner, I went through the motions of turning the lever and steering the car. The next thing I knew, I was on top of the car which had now turned into a train. It seemed as though I was very high up and the train was traveling very fast. Several times I nearly fell off, and I felt very frightened. I was also afraid that I would attempt to jump off. I was particularly anxious when the train rounded a bend. I noticed next that another family was sitting on the top of the train with me. A small baby was there and seemed to be thrilled with the ride. I felt as though I was the only one who was frightened.

I dreamt I was taking a bath and was holding a razor blade in my hand. The blade slipped on my leg and I cut a piece off of my leg and my foot came off. I called my mother to come immediately and told her to get the doctor. When she came to the bathroom I had already glued my foot back to my leg with the hope that the blood would coagulate and would harden and help keep my foot stuck to my leg. It was very loose though and my mother tried to help me. We finally decided it didn't look too bad, but we would call a doctor to fix it any how.

I dreamed I was preparing a meal for a large number of people. I recall seeing these people seated at a table in a large dining hall, yet I knew that they were in my home. I had the feeling that there were a great many people here, some of them strangers, yet I could only see a few familiar faces....most of them my family (mother, father, mother-in-law, sister-in-law). I then remember being in the kitchen getting ready to serve and some of the women had come in to help me. I remember dishing out noodles and soup into small bowls and serving them amidst a great deal of confusion. I then discovered to my dismay that I had not prepared enough food for everyone. I served the main course feeling very embarassed, but my sisters-in-law were assuring me that there was enough for everyone.
Interpretation
Two weeks ago I held a largee family dinner at my home. It was the first time I had ever prepared a meal for so many people at the same time.

I do not remember exactly what took place but I recall that we wished to go to some place of entertainment very badly, but we had no means of getting there. I remember seeing some woman with a grey P-- lamb coat there and I remember walking down the street wlth these people. She held my hand and led the way for me. Someone suggested we go to a large garage where he knew we could get a car, but he gave the impression that he would have to go thru a lot of red tape to get it. At the garage, everyone seemed very secrative. We got into the car and I knew we felt guilty because it was something we were not supposed to do. As we drove away, I saw some man watching us from a window. I ducked my head down so he would not see me cause I felt we were stealing the car and would get caught.

I dreamed I was somehow forced to get into a car. I had the feeling I was in danger and I had to get away. I began to drive this car and I felt as though I were in a strange environment. I realized then that I did not know how to drive and I began to feel insecure behind the wheel. I was a truck coming toward me and I did not know where the brake was. The truck gradually stopped as it approached me, but my car kept going and began pushing the truck in a backward direction. The truck driver was shouting at me trying to tell me how to stop and I kept apologizing that I was new at driving. The only other thing I remember was being stuck in the middle of a bill and trying to figure out a way to get off of it.

I was sitting in a corner of my room which is on the fourth floor of a dormitory here at school. A boy was perched on my window sill. This boy is about 23 years old and is the brother of a boy my age whom I dated two or three times my senior year in high school. On the tennis courts which are below my window, a group of people were playing volley ball. Someone hit the ball quite hard causing it to come up to my window. The boy caught it and instead of throwing it down, he jumped. from the window with it. I ran to the window and watched him fall to the ground. very, very slowly. He hit the ground so hard that his head split open and I could see the blood spurt out.
Interpretation
The reason for my dreaming was probably because I had forgotten to turn off the heat or raise the window and it had become quite warm in my room.

Two friends were visiting me in my home. One was J--, a very close friend of mine here at school. The other was one of two people. Both of these girls are friends of mine. It was time for us to catch the bus to return to school. We were in a very great hurry and I did not have time to pack so J-- packed for me. My father and his wife (my mother and father are dlvorced and my father is married again. I live with my mother but I am on very good terms with my father.) took us to the bus station which, although we were at home, seemed to be the one here in C--. My father opened the trunk of the car to get the suitcases but they were not there. He had left them at the hotel in which he had lived for a short time after my parents were divorced. Dad and I went to the hotel to get them leaving the others at the bus station. We arrived at the hotel but it seemed a very long time before we left because my father's wife kept delaying us. We finally left the hotel but Dad took a very long way to the station and drove very slowly. I urged him to drive faster so I wouldn't miss the bus but he would not. He flnally arrived and there at the station saw my father's secretary waving the bus tlckets in her hand. We had missed the bus. I turned to my father and asked him to please not bring H-- (his wife) with him any more when I had to catch a bus. I then opened my suitcase to see what J-- had packed for me and saw my pink blouse lying on top with a button off.
Interpretation
Two of my friends did visit me over vacation and we caught the bus back to school but there was no rush about it. I like my father's wlfe very much so I don't understand why I would ask him to brlng her along anymore; however she is quite slow. I don't understand why my father forgot the suitcase and drove so slowly because he is usually quite efficient. I do have a pink blouse and there is a button off it.

My dream is in three different parts and places which did not seem to have any interrelation. The flrst part took place in the kitchen at home. My mother had bought a new brown leather davenport and I was looking at it and wondering why it was in the kitchen. In the next part I was suddenly out in the snow walking along a little path. There was nothing around me for miles but walking along in front of me was a boy who kept getting farther away from me. It was getting dark and the snow was getting deeper. I called to the boy in front of me that it was getting dark and that we should go over to the road so we wouldn't get lost. I recognized the boy, let us call him W, to be a friend of my girl friend here at school. I walked over to the road which was quite slippery and began sliding along. Then suddenly I was in the living room of my dormitory. It was quite different from the way the room really is. I had two callers. One was the boy to whom I am pinned and the other was a friend whom I had dated at home during the summer. (Let us call the boy to whom I am pinned K-- and the other B) Both were sitting on the same couch reading a newspaper. I was unsure of how to handle the situation. I was afrald Ken would be angry because of the other boy. I introduced them but instead of calling Ken by his right name, I called him my brother's name. Then I was once again in the kitchen and the new brown couch had a red leather cover on it.
Interpretation
The brown leather couch was probably connected with the couches in the living room of the fraternity house of the boy to whom I am pinned. The snow was probably connected with the snow on the ground now. The fact that my brother, who is 24, and I are very close may have caused me to introduce K-- by my brother's name. Our kitchen at home is trimmed in red so that might account for the red cover for the couch.

I had a date with a boy that I used to date about a year and a half ago. I did not want to be with him because I was afraid the boy I am pinned to would see me. We were driving along the road on the way to a dance. When we finally arrived, a girl whom this boy had been dating recently was standing outside waiting for him. I was very relieved. We did not go into the dance but got back into the car again. The other girl sat in the middle. I was impressed by the wierd atmosphere. It was very windy and misty.

I was living in a very poor section of town--of what town I do not know. I had to go away for some reason and it seemed as though someone went with me but I don't remember who it was. When I came back again after about a year, everyone was changed and I was very sad because of this. The next part that I remember was in a bathroom. It was quite large and had a very large bath tub. Two girls were drawing water for a bath. One of the girls was a friend of mine who lives in the same dorm I do. She had her towel around her just as she always does before taking a bath. She was very excited because she was going to take a bath in such a large tub.

I do not know him in real life, but in the dream he was my cousin and my favorite relative. He looked at me and said, "Hello," but did not bow. I was puzzled. I entered a large drawing room. Several strange men were sitting there. I guessed they were my relatives. They paid no attention to me but stared vacantly into space throughout the dream. I stood in front of a fireplace.

Suddenly, down the street, rode my grandmother on a bright red motor scooter. She was riding very fast and going around corners all the time. My aunt just smiled indulgently. Then a group of girls came up to me and said they had heard my father was a famous baseball player and they wanted to meet him. I took them to a large building.

I dreamt that I was at the C-- skating club at a carnival. I don't remember being with anyone in particular. There were a great many people standing around however. I remember sitting on the built up stands and watching the skaters go through their various acts. And then the show was over and all the people were slowly leaving and it was getting later and later. I was sitting on the steps that lead up into the coat room. Everyone that went by me seemed to not see me although I was sitting there with no clothes on but some kind of a blanket over me. I remember asking everyone to bring me my clothes so I could go home, but they seemed not to hear me. For some reason I had the feeling that I couldn't move. Finally there was no one around but I still couldn't move. At this point I woke up.
Interpretation
I have been told that this type of dream where you are out in public without any clothes on and not being able to move, is a very common dream, and I have also been told that it is indicative of feelings of insecurity. Any further explanation, I can not give, on second thought the fact that I do not skate and would like to be able to skate might be the reason for my insecure feelings. I definitely had the sensation that I didn't belong because I couldn't skate.

2. I had the feeling of frustration in that I could not move or put my clothes on. A slight bit of fear at all the people ignoring me was also present.
3. An actual participant.

6. Yes, and always after I have been to that same place. Why, I don't know.

As nearly as I can recall, my dream began on an airplane. My companions were students of the same sex, and also a few older women who were apparently our teachers or perhaps chaperones. The interior of the plane was unique in that it resembled a large mansion with an overabundance of large easy chairs. I recall that we were on some kind of tour along the East Coast, with Florida as our ultimate destination. The most prominent thing in my dream to me was the fact that the plane was going by way of Alaska, and that I would have to be on the Plane with all these unliked strangers for days on end. Everyone else was having a good time doing such things as singing, eating, playing cards, and sleeping. I recall that one older woman, the particulars of whom apparently were minor to me, kept pestering me to do things that I had no desire to do. I remember distinctly being afraid to leave my chair or the window for fear the plane would land and I would miss my opportunity to get off and find help. I remember trying over and over again to convince everyone that we did not have to fly the course on which we had started. For some reason I was in a hurry to get back to a certain destination. Neither my home or Florida or any other specific place seemed to be in my dream as where I wanted to be. Occasionally, a familiar person that I liked walked by me, but seemed to be deaf to what I was saying, and apparently they were not conscious of my presence. I can remember distinctly that I thought I was in a world where no one else existed. The last thing before I woke up was that I experienced that falling through space feeling--at which point I woke up.
Interpretation
My knowledge of the causes and reasons for dreams is practically nil. This dream I remembered the next morning, as if it had actually happened. I gave each part thought, and these are my only results. I dislike flying, although when I have flown, no terrifying thing has happened. Perhaps the fact that my first flight was because of the need to return home from college on my father's death. As for my anger over going such a round about way; maybe that has some relationship for my liking to get places in a hurry for fear of missing something. The sensation of falling through space I have frequently in dreams. I have no fear of high places, deep water, and the like. Some say that that falling sensation may be partially attributed to insecurity of one kind or another. The general restlessness of the whole dream might be tied up with my always present nervousness before exam periods.

Answers to questions

I recall that my dream began with the sensation of getting off a boat. I was laughing at someone in front of me but I do not recall who it was. There was no one else around at that time. The next thing I remember was that I was in some large building of some kind, yet I remember that the building was surrounded by water and that I was walking all by myself through a dark tunnel way of some kind. All of a sudden I ran into a teacher I had. in high school, my chemistry teacher a woman I hated thoroughly. In my dream I was pleased to see her. With her was a girl that I met one summer while traveling. They asked me to get them a radio so they could listen to some music. I told them I couldn't because I was lost and I remember that I was awfully hungry. They told me that there was no food anywhere. I remember that I began to get frightened and tried to run. The door would not open so I ran the other way for what seemed to be hours, and the next thing I remember I was in my living room. Everyone in the room was looking out the windows at a big lake. On it were millions of big boats and they were all on fire. Then I recall trying to get away from the window but a crowd kept pushing me nearer and nearer the burning boats until finally I was surrounded by fire at which point I woke up to find myself standing up against the head board of my bed.
Interpretation
This dream was just before I got up, therefore it was not a sound sleep. We spend summers on a lake each year, and the night before we had been discussing next summer's plans. The fire, etc., might be explained by the fact that I had just seen a movie in which there was a great deal of fire. Fires always impress me because from the age of one I have been taught the dangers of forest fires in particular, whether the fact that I had eaten a hamburger etc. just before going to bed, has anything to do with my being hungry, is a mystery to me. On the other hand, being a dream near breakfast time, it could. be reflecting my anticipating breakfast.

Answers to questions
2. The only emotion that I recall was when I woke up, and that was surprise rather than fright.
3. An actual participant.
4. Both pleasant and unpleasant.
5. The setting varies as is explained, but it seems to me that I spent more time in that tunnel than anywhere else.
6. No
7. I remember that the fire was a definite red.

I dreamt that I was riding along in a big car, only it wasn't exactly a car. I was sitting in a big easy chair which had with it a long footrest. In the so called car with me was my aunt who was sitting in a chair similar to mine. Still another person was present. At one moment she resembled a classmate of mine, and yet the next moment she resembled no one T knew. I recall the sensation that we were driving over very flat and uninteresting country and that we all couldn't figure out why we didn't stop occasionally. Finally we stopped in front of a huge building of some kind, probably a gas station a little distorted. Everyone got out of the car but me, yet I recall I was the one who wanted to stop the most. Finally I was in the ladies room, the others having returned to the car. Right in the middle of the room, there was ?. big bed. I remember saying to myself that I mustn't lie down even for a minute because the others would worry. However, the next thing I remember was waking up with that awful feeling that they had gone without me, and that I couldn't comb my hair and that I was a wreck in general. At that moment I woke up.
Interpretation
This dream makes little sense to me. No part of it can I logically explain.

I dreamt last night that I was at a friend of mine's house at a fairly large party. Everyone was sitting around drinking beer and some were dancing. I remember that most of the people there I hadn't seen for a long time. I remember no specific people but I seemed to know them well enough to talk to them. Then I went into the kitchen where there were several people, and I stepped up to one person (I don't know who it was or even whether it was a boy or girl). I remember I screamed but nobody paid any attention to me or the person I choked. If I remember correctly, they went right on talking and laughing. The next thing I remember was running down what seemed to be stairs that never came to an end. Then I tripped and fell headfirst down the stairs and woke up with that falling through space sensation.
Interpretation
I was at a party that night, but I knew all the people. There were actually only about six or eight of us there. We did sit out in the kitchen and one boy fell off one of the kitchen stools. I imagine that might explain my falling down the stairs in my dream.

Answers to questions

I was standing in a large open space with nothing surrounding me but a large stone wall on one side. I recall that there were some people mingling around but who they were I don't know. Then I walked over to the wall and sat down. I began to eat a sandwich and it seemed that I kept eating and eating on that same one. A person was sitting next to me, a man that I know only casually, and I remember we were talking about how silly the other people were to get in line. By this time various people had gotten in line right in front of us. I remember we were sitting cross legged and that the sun was very hot. The next thing I remember was standing in line myself. I had that awful feeling that I was going to fall down any minute. At this moment I became conscious of a long glass paneling affair surrounding everyone. Through the glass I could see nothing but space, and the next thing I knew I was falling through space and I woke up.
Interpretation
The only thing that I could connect with actual life here is the fact that I had been on a picnic just prior to this dream.

Answers to questions
2. I recall no feeling in particular, even when I fell through space. I should say that I was more or less indifferent.
3. An actual participant.
4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant.

I was walking down town and it was raining very hard. But I have no recollection that I was getting wet. I was with my sister, who is five years my senior, and married. We went in and out of stores and came out of each store with our hands full. Yet before we went into the next store, our arms were again empty, where we left the stuff I have no idea. After doing this for it seemed hours, I recall we were driving along a very narrow tunnel and every once in awhile we would pass some one we knew but we never said anything to them. All the time we were driving along I also had the sensation of going up, as if in an elevator. The next thing I remember was being in swimming in a river with millions of people, because I recall they were all yelling to me to take off my hat and shoes. I was laughing and I don't think I paid any attention to them. Then I remember getting out, and I was home in bed. At that moment the alarm went off, and I remember how surprised I was to find myself actually in bed.
Interpretation
I had been down town prior to this dream but the only place I went was to the movies and not with my sister. The hat might be tied up with the fact that I hate hats, and only wear one when I have to; like when going down town.

I dreamt that I was in a large paneled library--and every wall was covered with books--only the books all had little people on them. There were many people in the room--but I can not remember who any of them were, except one man who I met at a concert in Boston--I have not seen or heard of him since. I recall he had a long broom in his hand, and appeared to be telling the guests who the people on the books were. They were in the majority, my classmates at college. Something he was saying about them was making me mad, and I remember I yelled something at him and he disappeared and suddenly I was alone in the library--I recall trying to leave but there was no door--then I woke up.

I was out in a large field--the grass was up to my knees and it was raining. There were lots of cows all around me. I recall sitting down in a big chair with a small radio on a table next to me.

I was out in front of my house waiting for someone, and it was at night - Down the street there was a group of singers standing singing songs. I decided to see if I could join them. When I got to the group I found that they were my aunts and uncles and cousins. I asked them to all come in and have something to eat - They agreed but when I started back up the street with them, we kept walking and walking - there were no houses at all - All I could see when I looked around for my house were stores, Finally they started to go into one of the stores - and I kept telling them that this wasn't my house.

I was on a train and I had been on it for weeks it seems. I was not upset about it but I was constantly telling all the people that I should be home washing dishes. Then I temporarily forgot about home and was enjoying myself with these people, none of whom I knew, in a big game of cards. What we were playing I can't remember, but I remember I was winning large sums of money and the strange part of it I was very sad and kept trying to give it to the people sitting near me but none of them would take, they just laughed and said I had to keep it. Finally I burst out crying and left the crowd.
Interpretation
My mother is on the train returning home and I had quite a few dishes to wash before her arrival, but the rest of the dream means nothing to me. I never play cards for money and I have no desire to. The only card game I enjoy is bridge which is rarely played for money.

The setting of this dream took place at school in H--. I was talking with a former student of Mother who also was a former psychology student. I dreamed that she was taking Personality & Adjustment & had recorded one of her dreams. I was reading it.

I dreamed that I had a job as counseling. My older brother and I were walking to my office when I saw a group of people standing in front of the door. One of the bodies turned around and I recognized her as the sister of a friend of mine. (This friend at one time meant very much to me. We had planned to be married as soon as I finished college.) The sister, R--, showed surprise at seeing me, as she didn't realize that I was the counselor she had made an appointment with. She made some remark about my being successful and also about my settling down and getting married. I realized then that she thought my brother was my husband. I proceeded to introduce him to all the people. Mr. D., R's father, did not remember me at all, and R explained to me that his memory was failing.
R and I then went into my office which seemed to be in the basement of my sister's home. In the basement I had my desk, which was cluttered with papers etc. There were colorful rugs on the floor. She told me her reason for coming. It seems that her brother was in trouble and she was trying to help him. He had stolen something and was sent to jail. I was quite nervous as these people were my first counselees and at the same time I couldn't possibly see how I was going to help them as long as he had been caught stealing. I felt perplexed because I didn't feel as if I were capable of helping them. While I was talking to her, I was also trying to hurry up the case, as my sister had bought some new rugs & I wanted to see them.

I dreamed that I was roller skating on a very unusual skating floor. The floor seemed to be slanting at a slight degree towards the middle, from all sides. In the middle was a bridge and underneath it were damp wet leaves, grass, etc. I seemed to be the only one skating but there were several men standing around watching. One man was standing underneath the bridge and motioned for me to come near him. I tried to ignore him but the bridge seemed to be magnetized and I was drawn to him. He began to put his arms around me and I attempted to release his grasp. It seemed that I had no strength in my arms at all. I started to scream as I was terrified but I still had hopes that my screams would attack the other men's attention & they would come to my rescue. The other men just looked at me, ignored my screams, and walked away.

This dream took place over in Europe. I was there with a friend of mine. We were planning to escape by plane and fly back to the U.S. As we were making plans, my father got into the plane and started the motors. The plane was unusual in appearance. It seemed to have a brown cabin with wings extending on the end of the cabin, & was very awkward looking. H___, the friend who was with me, and I stood there in amazement watching my father try to fly in such a small area that could be used for a runway. There seemed to be a lake around & in one of my father's unsuccessful attempts to fly away, he landed in the water. Then the plane diminished in size to the size of a toy plane, and it also changed from brown to black. I waded in the water and pushed the plane on shore.

This dream took place on our farm. It concerned my brother, sister, father, and me. We had done something to antagonize my father and consequently, we were running away from him. It seemed to be in the fall because we were running through hayfields & cornfields. The corn was taller than we so we thought it would hide us from our father. The three of us got separated & I hid in a building, which was on a neighboring farm. My father followed me rather than my brother or sister. He saw me run into this building and I knew it; so I knew that sooner or later he would come in & get me. For a while, he was running around the building pretending to look for me. This attracted the neighbors attention and soon there were three or four people standing around. My only consolation was that I thought my father wouldn't punish me very severely in front of the neighbors.

I dreamed that my brother-in-law & I were walking down town in C____. We met this friend who turned to me and said that his daughter wanted to see me. I looked down E____ Ave. & she was in their car waiting for me and at the same time, she was holding up traffic. Drivers behind her were getting impatient & were blowing their horns. As I crossed the street to get into the car, I was conscious of wearing my bedroom slippers as I realized they looked a little conspicuous in downtown C____.
A___ & I drove away and she told me that she was extremely nervous as she had just been in a wreck. She was extremely anxious about her sister-in-law who had just had a baby and who was with her at the time of the wreck.

By this time we were driving down a rather narrow road - just wide enough for 2 cars. It was at night & the street was dark. I offered to drive for her, so she stopped the car & we exchanged places. There wasn't much traffic so I was going pretty fast. Ahead, I could see a car parked & a big greyhound bus coming. I thought I could pass the parked car before I met the bus but I couldn't. We collided & we all got out to see the damages. I told A___ that I had no driver's license but not to mention the fact.

I dreamed about a young married couple whom I have known for a long time. They came to see us at our home. Although the home was ours, it resembled my Uncle's home in C___ and yet the dream seemed to take place in C ___.. They drove up in a Model A Ford & parked it in the front yard. We were in the living room talking when another Model A Ford drove up & in it were my sister & a friend of mine. I went out in the front yard, got in this couple's car, and started to talk to my sister. D___ my sister, asked me if I wanted to go to a play with J. She said that she and her husband weren't going. I realized that I would have to go with him alone, so I refused. Then they drove away and the wife came out in the yard. She seemed perturbed at my getting into their car, so she got into the car and backed it away. The car then suddenly changed into an old-fashioned bicycle. It was at this time that I felt antagonistic towards this couple.

This dream took place in a large room which is unfamiliar to me. In this room was a long table and on it were some presents and some graduation pictures of me. The room was filled with people - neighbors, friends and relatives. Two of my neighbors, who are 8 and 12 years of age, were standing near the table passing out my graduation pictures to anyone who wanted them. I was trying to stop them and at the same time I was wondering how I was going to pay for them. The gifts on the table were for me. I opened them and each gift seemed to be a deck of playing cards except the last one I opened. It was yarn for knitting, knitting needles, and all the necessary implements needed to knit socks. I remember thinking to myself that now I would have to learn to knit.

I dreamed I was in a psychology class and was sitting next to one of my girl friends. The seats were not arranged in an orderly fashion but seemed to be mixed up in a disorderly manner. I had a balloon & was playing with it when my girl friend reached out to get it. I gave it to her & felt relieved for doing it as I felt Dr. H___'s eyes on me. This friend took the balloon & blew it up - it was a long balloon and was yellow. Suddenly Dr. H___ stopped talking, walked down the aisle and grabbed the balloon away from my friend. He seemed to be so angry that he lost all coordination which caused him to have a peculiar walk. As he was walking towards his desk, he took his pencil and punctured the balloon. One could tell from the expression on his face that he was very angry.

I dreamed that I was waiting for a street car on E___ Ave. None was coming so I got discouraged & started to walk. (Some people were with me but I can't identify them). As I was walking down the sidewalk I noticed that I didn't have my black purse. I glanced towards the safety zone & there was my purse. There were no people standing on the zone at the time but some road construction workers were fixing the avenue near the safety zone. One man saw my purse about the same time that I had begun walking back to get it. Immediately he opened it & began taking the things he wanted, including my wallet.

I dreamed of a girl, who is just a casual acquaintance of mine. This girl was insane. I was in a bar with some friends of mine. This insane girl came in with her two sisters. The minute she saw me, she started to run towards me. I was terrified & started to run around the circular bar. The sisters tried to get her under control but seemed to be having a difficult time with her. I ran upstairs hoping that the sisters would take her home. I thought they had gone, so I came downstairs again & was quite calm when I saw her again. She had managed to free herself from her sisters & returned to the bar. When she saw me, she laughed hysterically & started to approach me. Her sisters were right behind her and immediately grabbed her arms & again tried to take her home.

I dreamed I was at a dance with a friend. It was rather dark and there were many people there. As we were dancing, this friend I suddenly started to cry. I got disgusted & said to him. "If you are going to act like an eight-year old, I don't want to have anything to do with you." We left the dance floor. He was still feeling bad & made some remark about being emotional.

When I came in the children climbed all over me, and the teacher was trying to talk to me but the children kept interrupting.

I was taking an examination in writing letters which were to be sent to W----. My grandmother and a friend with whom I am only slightly familiar, female named C----, were in the examination.

C---- was particularly in a state of confusion and I was struggling to get to an emergency post office of which several were set up in case important letters had to get through to W----.

I dreamt that I followed a band, leading a parade, down a wide avenue. The band stopped and the small crowd including myself sat cross-legged in the street. A man with gray hair and a gray pin-stripe suit sat near me. I looked up and saw a company: of Ethiopians with regular Roman-like features and grim expressions on their faces riding on gigantic white horses with flags and lances extended ahead of them. They were riding down on us and with only slight concern I crawled to the curb on hand and knees. I went into a picnic pavilion big enough for only one table. I discovered I didn't have any cigarettes with me so I left with a friend of mine a man, 21 years of age, to buy some. We went to a small delicatessen store to get some. While there my mother gave me an aluminum plate, square in shape with the word K---- engraved and embossed on it. When I got back, I showed the plate to a girl which I hardly know and she told me to turn it over and when I did it turned to glass and became an ash-tray. I discovered I had forgotten to buy the cigarettes so I borrowed one from a friend of the boy I had left with. The pack had only a few cigarettes with papers on in it. I took one and then tried lighting one without a paper. I threw it on the floor and watched it burn to an ash.

I dreamt that I got up one morning and decided to wear a pair of loafer shoes that day. I couldn't find them and I searched everywhere but all I could find were summer sandals which I thought inappropriate because it was snowing out. I kept thinking it was impossible that I could have mis-laid them because I valued them so highly. Finally I recalled that I had thrown them away because they needed repairing.

I dreamt that I was married to the brother of a friend of mine but of whom I'm not necessarily fond. He is 20 years of age. It seems that he was very disagreeable and I felt discouraged that I had married him. One morning he was very nasty so I went out to some hill and took a pair of gloves from a dead man lying on the side of the hill. They were white gloves with small red rods printed on them that looked like disease germs. These gloves were capable of giving a fatal disease to anyone I touched with them but they dldn't harm me. I returned home and maliciously infected my husband while pretending to be klnd to him.
Interpretation
I can't lmagine why I felt so destructive. Actually I like the boy and I'm very fond of his sister. I've stayed at their house overnight and in the morning at breakfast he was as disagreeable as he was in the dream.

I dreamt that I was descending the stairs in an unfamiliar hallway. At the bottom a friend, (male, age 26) was waiting. I had something in my hand which caused me to be very embarrassed. At the foot of the stairs there was a small maple chest of drawers in the top drawer of which I deposited the article that was embarrassing me. (I don't know exactly what it was.) The man turned me around and kissed me. At first I felt rigid and then I felt as if I were melting and floating away on a cloud.

I dreamt I was out on the end of a break water in the lake. At a battered shack in which furniture was sold. The furniture was modernistic design and very beautiful. I left the shack and on the way back to 1and I watched the fisherman. About 20 feet from shore I slipped off the rock. I was holding onto one rock and the waves were washing over and around me. I was not in the least bit afraid but only interested in the beauty of the breaking waves. I next found myself on land and the fishermen were showing me their tackle. They made a fishing rod of boxes of graduated sizes. The rod was covered with wallpaper with big dark red roses on it like that on my bedroom ceiling. I then ascended some old wooden steps up to the cliff that overlooked the lake. I walked through a meadow of tall grass out to a point overlooking the lake.

The dream begins as I am standing at a window watching a beautiful sunrise. The sky seems to be filled with all colors--red and gold especially against an azure blue sky. I realize that I am in the desert and am in the W-- B--. The next moment I am on the Navy bus going to work. I see the brown hills, the clean white desert, and at a far, snow-covered mountains. My inner feeling is one of great happiness -- I feel completely free and independent.
Interpretation
For several months I worked for the Navy on a base located in the M-- desert. I fell in love with the desert--it was beautiful. I had the feeling of being free. Here in C-- I have seemed to have developed a terrible feeling of claustrophobia. In the first place, it is a dirty city. I have seen nothing of real beauty since I've been here -- just ugly houses and barren trees. I like the feeling of being able to look for miles across the wide open spaces. Living in a dormitory means abiding to several regulations, which takes away any feeling of being independent one might have had.

The dream begins when I am met at the N-- Y-- train station by my boy friend, 24 yrs. (whom I have not seen in a year). He does not kiss me but takes me by the arm and leads me into a restaurant. We are sitting across the table from each other; he does not say a word but smiles in a mysterious way. I try to reach him but while doing so, the table seems to grow in size and I cannot reach him. My philosophy teacher, 65 years, enters the picture. My friend writes out a note and gives it to him, where upon he leaves the room and the dream ends.
Interpretation
The trip is one I am planning to take in the near future. I have no idea what the results will be--but I have the feeling of wanting him but realizing that it may not work out. I cannot understand why he restrains himself when he is with me -- except for the fact that he is a Catholic (I am not). My philosophy teacher's appearance in the picture may have been a symbol for my religious difference. or maybe it was because my friend is a devout Catholic and he did not want someone interfering with out problem--someone who would probably not agree with him in his outlook--so he got him to leave us alone.

Dream begins when I am home in C--. My mother and I are sitting in the living room. I ask her questions about how and when one of my brothers was killed. I ask her how old I was when the accident happened and she says I was five. I answer by saying then he was twelve and that I should be able to remember what happened. Mother starts to cry, becomes hysterical, and keeps repeating that she could have saved his life if she had taken him to the hospital just one hour sooner. She appears to go completely insane. My father, 53 yrs., comes into the picture and tries to help her but can do nothing.--All at once my mouth is filled with blood and my front teeth begin to fall out--dream ends.
Interpretation
Actually I was two years old when one of my brothers was killed by a truck. He was seven at the time. I remember nothing about him, but have often wondered what the facts were concerning the accident. I have never questioned my parents about it, because I realize it would only bring back very unpleasant memories. About two days before I had this dream, the maid here in the dorm told me that once she took an overdose of sleeping tablets, and that if they had waited another hour before taking her to a hospital she would have died. This probably accounts for the part I dreamed where mother said she could have saved my brother's life if she had taken him to a hospital one hour sooner. The disconnected ending, I have no explanation for.

Interpretation
Since I have been away from home, I have naturally thought more about my parents--wondering how happy they really are, etc. I have thought of all the things I want to do and see, and yet realized that probably many of these wishes my own mother once dreamed of--but they were never to be fulfilled.

I do not know where this dream took place, only that it was in a mountainous region. I alone, was climbing up the side of a mountain with only the earth and weeds to cling to. As I climbed the earth crumbled beneath me but I did not fall. People were below watching in amazement. Only one person can I vividly remember; a girl about 32 years old with whom I worked in a shoe factors in C--. She kept saying I would not get to the top, but I did and I can remember vividly, pulling myself over the top and then being able to walk on flat land, feeling free and happy. The people disappeared and there was just I and miles of flat land ahead of me. Dream ended.
Interpretation
I have done much mountain climbing and have always loved it. I love the out-of-doors, especially when by myself. I like the feeling of being away from people, especially when I seem to think I am bored with them. I remember saying to a friend the day before this dream, that I was bored with the girls in the dorm and dorm life, and that I would give anything to take a trip, preferably to the mountains, just to "get away from it all" for awhile. This feeling was probably responsible for such a dream.

To begin with, I dreamed that my father had been killed while working on the railroad. I seemed to be crying and could feel the choking in my throat. The scene changed and I was in C--. My aunt (40 yrs. old) told me that she and my uncle (58) were getting a divorce. I asked her why and she said that she knew he was still in love with his former wife. The scene changed again, and I was uptown in P-- with my cousin, the daughter (17 yrs.) of the couple written about above. We were crossing the main street and narrowly missed being hit by an automobile. Dream ended.
Interpretation
Not long ago I had a letter saying that lightning struck the freight car on which my father was on, and by pure luck he was not killed. That probably accounts for the first part of my dream, as I have thought about the incidence quite a bit. My uncle and aunt did talk of divorce once, and it is true that he has never gotten over the love for his first wife. It was probably in my mind because the day before this dream I had spoken of these relatives to another person. The day before this dream, another girl and I were almost hit by an automobile. Here it was my cousin, probably because of just dreamlng about her mother and father.

This dream took place in P--, C--. My mother and I were in the public library together. I left her for a few moments and met an older man (who is about 40 years old, was the chaperon on a couple of geology trips I was on and who apparently took a great interest in me). He asked me to go to a bar and have a couple of drinks with him. We started walking toward the city hall and all at once the street and sidewalks were crowded with 'madly' rushing people shouting and screaming. We stopped and heard the sound of explosions, each one getting louder than the one before. Some one cried that the world was coming to an end. We started running back to the library and then stopped again as we saw a car sliding sidewards, going at a rapid speed, which hit another car. Here I seemed to realize that the people in cars were driving as fast as they could in order to escape the explosions and death. People were thrown out of one of the cars. Two people seemed to have been killed. Dream ended.
Interpretation
I probably dreamed of this certain man because I had just had a letter from him. I account for dreaming about explosions because the day before this dream I had commented to some one about how terrible it was that there have been so many explosions lately--L. A. C--, C--. We also discussed the atomic bomb and the fact that it is possible for the world to be destroyed by it. I cannot explain the car accident except for the fact that I have never quite got over an accident I was in about a year ago, and have hence been extremely nervous when riding with some one who is driving at a fast speed--

The dream took place in restaurant (it appeared to be C-- here at l05th). I was sitting across from a friend of mine (boy, 23 years old.) He was smiling and reached across the table to hold my hand--I felt happy and relieved.
Interpretation
A few nights previous to this dream, this boy and I had a misunderstanding. I felt rather bad about it because we had been good friends and I hated to think that this one incidence might affect it. The thought had entered my mind that he might take me out to dinner and all would be straightened out.

Interpretation
The girl whom I dreamed of has rather impressed me since I first saw her, because she looks so much like one of my good friends in C--. Everytime I see her I always think of this other girl.

About two weeks before entering M--- as a transfer student I dreamed that I was dead for two years--that is, I felt as if I were dead but it turned out that I had been in an insane asylum for two years. At the end of this time my friends came to call for me. I was full of questions about everyone & asked why my best friend had not come along to call for me. They sneered & said she was quite changed & had been living with a man. They told me, too, that the man with whom I was in love had visited me several times with a girl from N--- Y---.

I had been very unhappy over the prospect of going to M--- at the time of this dream & felt that I would just have to "stick it out" for two years. The girl from N--- Y--- was a figure in my friend's past--a figure who had been on my mind for some time.

I dreamed I had received an invitation to join one sorority and my friend had been asked to join another. I can remember in my dream that I preferred the latter and wondered why I was not asked to join. One of the girls in the sorority which had asked me to join told me that she knew I really didn't like them and that I had told everyone that they did not date very often. The scene shifted to one of the sorority houses (none of them have any). Someone was telling me that "our house"--presumably I was living at an independent student dorm similar to one in which I lived while at the U--- of W--- would have to break up next semester because all of the girls were moving into sorority houses. I was very perturbed because my friends would all be separated and, since my sorority did not have a house, I would have no place to live.
Interpretation
Because of rush week and the various sorority parties, sororities have been the topic of conversation. My friends and I are divided on the opinion of which we want to join, and I imagine that is the reason for the dream.

This dream had many parts, none of which seemed to be related. First I was square dancing on roller skates and found it very difficult to stop. Then I was taking care of a baby who had very bright blond hair. He swallowed something and my mother and I shook him until it came out. We then put him on the porch to sleep in the sun and he turned very tan. He was to be Bing Crosby's fifth son. Suddenly I was at the home of some married friends. Two of our mutual friends arrived, one of whom I dated extensively this summer. I found it necessary to laugh hysterically in their presence. I also urinated in their presence experiencing no emotion while doing so and feeling as if it were a natural occurrence. I then found myself in my own home and my great uncle who has been dead for two years visited us. I asked him why I hadn't seen him for so long, sat in his lap and he stroked my hair as he had done when I was very young. I then watched a boy whom I know only very casually have an epileptic fit--I have never witnessed one in real life.
Interpretation
The only part of the dream I can attempt to explain is the one in which I urinated in front of the man with whom I was in love and our friend who is at present one of my best friends and with whom I have a platonic relationship. They have both told me that I was inhibiting my sexual desires and afraid of sex. Perhaps I wished to show them that I could be very frank and open about sex. Also, the fact that I found it necessary to laugh when I saw them was my desire to show them that I was not unhappy because we had "broken up." As a matter of fact, in real life I was unhappy about the situation for quite some time.

I had to leave a gathering of several M-- acquaintances at which we were seated around a table singing. I had to take part in a Valentine's Day program to be given at my former elementary school. The girls handed me what they thought was my coat, and then another, and then another until they finally came to mine. I remember that all of the coats were dark green although they differed in style. Arriving at the school I asked one of the children how to get on the stage and he directed me. I know I had a costume, but I don't remember it except for a Mexican blouse, and I don't remember my part, The face and name of the Master of Ceremonies kept changing, but he was always the same person. A professor of psychology whose course I took in another university walked down the aisle from the audience with his notes under his arm. He walked to a magazine rack which was at one side of the stage and picked up different magazines, all of which had a cover design depicting winter and snow flurries, sleighs, etc., and one of which was titled the Philadelphia Story. He then walked to the Master of Ceremonies, they kissed, and he took over the remainder of the program.
Interpretation
The only phase of this dream I can possibly interpret is my part in a program and the Mexican blouse as part of the costume. I did a Mexican dance in a program given at the university from which I transferred. I cannot explain anything else.

I was driving a new maroon car and realized when I stopped that I hadn't shifted gears, but had been driving in neutral all the way. The back door wouldn't close and I drove with one hand and kept trying to slam the door with the other. I arrived at my friend's apartment in M-- B--, but it was in C--. Everyone was walking around downtown C-- in beach clothes, very tan. My friend, her parents and several other girls were in the apartment. A man knocked on the door and said he had come to borrow something. He was eating sections of an orange. I remember remarking on the attractiveness of the kitchen. It was all red and white. There was a silent butler of bright red lying on the table. Some of my friends at the apartment were speaking of a birthday luncheon for another friend to which I had not been invited. One of the girls present was a casual friend at the U-- of W--, two were from M--. The girl from W-- was wearing a white half slip. I stood there in a black half slip.

I was staying at a large home--the home Or my aunt and uncle, and there were lots of people around--lots of girls staying with me for some reason. They kept coming in and finally the clothes rack was so crowded not another thing could be squeezed in. A boy in whom I am not at all interested came into my room while I was studying. Then I saw us in bed, I only partially clothed. I kept assuming provocative positions and teasing him. Finally he grabbed and kissed me, and I very coldly told him to leave the house. He then went to the bathroom and I wondered whether he would use my pretty yellow towel. I can remember other bits of the dream--red carnations and a bottle of perfume that was found in the back of an old drawer. The bottle was gold and shaped oddly like a flask or a snake. I opened it and everyone said the perfume was lovely but I couldn't smell it and I, very panicky, kept asking, "Why can't I smell it? Why can't I smell it?" I rubbed it all over my hands in order to be able to.

I dreamed that I was with a very good friend of mine. (We both use our relationship as proof of the possibility of platonic love.) However, in the dream, seated or standing, our bodies were intertwined and neither could move without the other moving. Our hands, feet, legs, etc. were lapped over each other.
Another part of the dream in which my friend was not presented related to a meeting I had to attend. It was to be held in the dining hall of a church and I kept walking up flights of stairs through room after room, looking for my meeting & only finding Sunday School classes.

Interpretation
My friend & I are seen together so frequently on campus that many people have asked us if we were "going steady." This always amuses us as we consider each other simply as very good friends. Perhaps the intertwined bodies symbolized our "togetherness." However, I was surprised & aware during the dream that our closeness was not unaccompanied by an exotic feeling.

Actually I had received notice of a meeting to be held in the dining hall of a church & I remarked then that I hadn't the slightest idea where it was.

This dream is very vague and hard to recall. I know I was sitting on the grass with a school friend. A car drew up & a man got out. I saw the back of his head which had a round bald spot and thought, "He must be related to S--." I have spent several months "getting over" S-- and had thought myself well out of the whole affair at the time of the dream. The man came over & spoke to us & he was S--'s brother. I kept making nasty remarks in regard to S--'s forthcoming marriage thinking at the same time, "Darn! I'm only showing him how much I still care." I also kept telling him my name & was disturbed that it made no impression on him for S--- had supposedly told his brother all about me, that being the height of the sublime.
I think I awoke & then dreamed of being in a hospital--for lunch or something else other than illness. I waited for an elevator in a tri-cornered section. I don't remember much more except that we had a cafeteria-type luncheon & doctors kept wheeling out huge contraptions that looked like the side of a building.

Interpretation
Actually S--- is not bald, but he is being married very soon. His dream brother was quite young & good-looking whereas his brother in real life is much older than he. I'm very conscious now of my feeling toward him because people talk to me of his engagement & proceed to either watch or question me quite frankly as to my reaction. I think the fact that I dreamed of a brother is significant because I have felt for some time that S--- has an inferiority complex because of his brother who is in the same profession as S--- and is one of the top men in his field. Perhaps rather than give him his just attributes I made him young & good-looking rather than very brilliant and very kind.

A boy named Charles Brown was living secretly in our garage. No one knew he was there & he didn't know that we knew, but we wanted to protect him. A letter for him came to the house and I slipped it under the garage door. It turned out to be new license plates. A colored man came up the driveway while I was standing on the back porch with a girl friend. I pushed her into the house and I too went in and tried to lock the door. It was very difficult, but I finally got it locked. Then I saw a boy I had dated for a long time and whom I had considered marrying. He is now married. He was wearing a very gaudy suit, but it was beautifully tailored. He told me that he was still in love with me before he got married, and in my dream he told me to forget what he had said and that he was really happily married. A younger sister of a M--- acquaintance came into my room and jumped up and down on my toes. I turned her over my knees and spanked her. I went shopping with a girl I dislike. She wanted a mouton coat. They showed her one, and I said, "That's not an imitation beaver. That's an imitation Persian." I was to meet my mother and a girlfriend at the H---. My mother--who doesn't smoke--came into the lobby smoking from a long cigarette holder.
Interpretation
It's difficult for me to find any consistent strain in the various parts of this dream. The boy named Charles was red headed and I've become interested in a red haired boy, if that means anything. I think my old friend's telling me he was happily married is a product of guilt feelings on my part--that he may have married to spite me and that he isn't happy because of me. The gaudy but well-tailored suit is typical of him, and one of the things to which I most objected as being so much a part of his "showy" personality.

I and another member of my family (either my father or my mother) were sitting huddled on the stairs. Someone was sitting on the landing above, fishing, and we kept trying to keep out of reach of the hooks. I imagine we could have gotten away but somehow we had to stay. In another fragment of the dream I was driving a truck and two of my school friends were with me. We went from store to store buying books. I could see myself shifting gears & even said in the dream, "Now put her in second, now third," etc.
Interpretation
I have no interpretation, but I do wonder about driving. This is the third dream I have had in which I have been driving and shifting gears has been such an important part of the dream.

I dreamt I was married to a boy I am seeing quite a bit of but with whom I am not in love. In my dream I was very happy and very much in love. We had a son about two years old. We put him to bed and prepared for bed ourselves. Somehow I hadn't had marital relations with my husband at all except once years ago. I knew that tonight we would--I had no reason for not having slept with him until now, but we were certainly on good terms. Just as we got into bed I realized I hadn't taken my bath. I said I'd be right back & not to go to sleep until I did come back. When I went to the bathroom another girl from an adjoining apartment was running the water. I told her I was in a hurry & to please take her bath next door. She did. I took my bath & rushed back to the bedroom. My husband was asleep. I felt a very strong physical desire to intercourse--I mean I felt it while I was asleep, but it was extremely strong.

A car full of my friends & I went to pick up a boy whom I don't know at his home. It was an immense home. The rooms were divided by large pillars & we drove right into the house. It was quite a test of driving skill because the pillars were close on either side of the car. I talked to the boy's sister while the others went upstairs to get him. We heard the sound of footsteps outside & looked for prowlers. The wind howled. The boy was just back from the U--- of I--- & said he was D--- C---'s roommate. The sister had red hair & turned out to be only 14 after I thought she was my age. I woke up, looking for & expecting to find a prowler in my room. I went back to sleep & found myself selecting saddle leather handbags. The clerk was a girl who used to work for my Dad & whom I have seen several times recently. All the bags were soiled and marked down. The scene shifted to the dime store where I was selecting jade rings. They must have been made of candy, because I nonchalantly chewed one of them. One was the figure of a Mexican, another a turban-covered face. I was with an older woman I knew but cannot now identify. She was holding my watch for me. It was five o'clock & we couldn't put our call through to Italy since it was three o'clock there, and also because of the telephone strike.
Interpretation
I have been looking for a saddle leather bag, so that part of the dream seems simple enough. Why I should be calling Italy--I am not Italian nor do I have any Italian friends---is beyond me.

When I came near to my dressing table I pulled at the skirt of it until the thumbtacks fell out. I gathered a handful of the tacks and when my brother approached again I threw them directly at his face. I saw his face vividly. He was wearing his glasses.
Interpretation
Although my brother and I argue frequently we never display the kind of activity seen in my dream and at the time of my dream we were on particularly good terms.

There was a queen contest. I was the Queen of 0-- and one of my M-- friends was Queen of N.E. M-- & S.W. C-- which was the most important "queenship." We were to step forward on the stage, state our name & territory. She, the most important queen, stuttered & faltered. When my turn came I was stately & regal. After the program we assembled downstairs in an auditorium. There were many photographers and several "drug store cowboy" type of boys. One said of me, "She is cute, but I bet she's thirty if she's a day." My former roommate was there & I told her of seeing the man in whom I had been interested. She told me her friends at school didn't like my future sister-in-law, and why had I given her such a buildup? (They've never met her) I said I hadn't. I was eating dark bread & marmalade & offered her some. The bread slice was so thick she had to cut it through the center. I said, "here, take the piece with more bananas on it & there appeared small slices of banana on the bread. There were more confused parts that I can't remember.
Interpretation
No interpretation except that I have wondered several times how my friends would accept my future sister-in-law. I imagine the queen contest was to flatter a needy ego.

I could only remember blurred, confused parts of this dream. I know there was an old, self-service elevator & and my friends operated all through the dream. We'd either stop too high or too low & could never quite adjust to floor level. Something about a man & we, I don't know what cause my friends to say it was his fault & excuse me. I know he was in the dream. We embraced frequently & in their presence. They said our positions were vulgar. I don't remember who he was, but I knew him. I was then in a store choosing oranges for my mother. I said none of them were Juicy enough. Then I was the clerk & apologized for being dressed in a skirt & sweater.
Interpretation
The elevator was exactly like the one at the place where I worked this past summer. At that time I wasn't terribly adept at handling the elevator. No interpretation for the remainder of the dream.

My former room-mate had an apartment and her colored maid was working for her. I came to live with her--I remember it was out of town. someone else, very fashionable but not very secure financially--I can't remember who it was--came to stay with us. She offered to keep house for us in order to pay & I remember thinking it was a great concession. vaguely I remember we were always taking showers. If my room-mate were taking a shower I handed her clothes through the door. She followed the same procedure with me. I suddenly realized that I wasn't paying & she told me that my mother was paying her mother in C-- for my board but she would appreciate my paying rent.

I was back visiting my friends at the D-- in W--. I met all the new girls I've heard about & they seemed to know who I was. One of my friends was wearing two fraternity pins & when I asked her why said, "One's for me & one's his." Another friend of mine looked at me significantly as if to say "She's a dope." The house & rooms were not the same as they are in actuality, but this did not seem to bother me in the dream. I had come somewhere with my mother & it was time to leave. I did not want to take two streetcars & a bus home & it was snowing, etc., so I asked if they could lend me a car. The only one they had was one they said my father had purchased in Europe. It was bright yellow & very strange looking. Instead of my wearing the old-fashioned goggles the car had a sort of goggles & hood affair in front. Whoever it was that gave me the car said there was an over-accumulation of oil. He or she then tipped the car over & the oil--a horrible looking yellow-brown fluid, poured into the mud & strangled some snakes & worms. On the way home there was something about a tennis court I do not remember.
Interpretation
I had Just received a letter from W-- telling me my friend had been pinned & mentioning some of the new girls at the house. That part of the dream was fairly accurate--I saw only those people who are there though the room was different. The other part of the dream was more vague & hard to interpret. I know that this is at least the fourth time since beginning these records that I have dreamed of cars or driving them. It seems strange that the seasons in my dream were so mixed--snowstorms, tennis courts, etc.

All I could remember of this dream seems to be very scant. I was riding on a horse in the woods. I was conscious of the green grass and the brown bark of the brown trees. After trotting for a few minutes the horse threw me off his back. I was very frightened and yelled. Before I could do anything else, the horse began to chew my hand. It was very sinister to watch him gnaw at the bones. I woke up as he had chewed half my hand.
Interpretation
Probably the brown horse was my goal. When he threw me off it probably revealed someone blocked my goal and I became frustrated. Although this interpretation might be far from the point it does seem plausible. Lately I am beginning to feel my goal in life is being blocked. Because all my friends are getting engaged and I am beginning to feel that I will be an old maid. My inability to get a husband will probably result in frustration.

The interpretation of the horse eating my hand is very clear. On Friday, prior to this dream, I did go to the doctor to see about my finger. From playing golf I received a sore, and this sore developed into a wart. The doctor burned it and nothing remains where the sore had been. The horse in this instance could be the doctor attending to my sore finger.

I was sitting in the kitchen just doing nothing. The time of day wasn't too clear, although I believe it was early morning. Our family owned two cats; a little black kitten and the huge white mother cat. As I was sitting in the kitchen I could hear the mother cat coming out from the basement. To my surprise, a lion appeared instead of the mother cat.
Reluctantly, I rode the lion out to the backyard. After getting off the back of the lion I tied it up to the fence. I might add I tried to tie the lion up to the fence but because I was very frightened I ran back into the house. The dream ended at this point.

Interpretation
I cannot imagine why I dreamed of cats because I actually hate them. The fact that the white mother cat turned out to be a lion possibly goes to reveal that one of my friends has a duel personality. It could possibly mean that this personal friend of mine is directly related to my goal. It is all very peculiar and hard to interpret.

One Sunday afternoon H., 20 yrs., my girlfriend, I., 23, her fiancee, a girlfriend who I cannot identify, B., 23, and I all went to a dance. These are all my friends. We went to a paladium that looked like the H. Theatre from the outside but had every earmark of H. H. at M. University. We all went in but we found everyone singing instead of dancing. Therefore we all sat down and began singing. My three girlfriends from M. University came in also. C., one of the girls was mad at me because I wouldn't exchange seats with her. A boy, I. was there and he was wearing a blue suit and new shoes.
After the program all the kids came to my house. My dad was home and so naturally I introduced him to all my friends. He was so funny that everyone had a swell time. The dream ended at this moment.

Interpretation
Since I have many friends it does seem probable to dream of so many friends. The paladium that resembled the H. Theatre as well as H. probably could be traced back to last year. At that time I had a conflicting cholce to make. I couldn't decide if I should go back to M. University (where I spent my freshman year) or enter F. S. M. College.

The change from dancing to singing could be that I recently joined a choir. My interest in music is being stimulated even though I still hold a great interest for dancing.

The reason that I. entered my dream seems due to the interest I held in him last semester. Unconsciously, I am still thinking of him, although not consciously. He always wore a blue suit. The new shoes probably is due to the fact that I went out the Saturday night before with a fella that wore new shoes. It may be probable that I would a man assimilated between these two characters.

I am very used to having all the friends come over my house so this last part of the dream is very real. Although my dad isn't very funny with my friends. He is very friendly but not very funny. Could it be that I wish my dad to be funny with the company I bring?

B., a friend of mine around 23 yrs. old and 6 ft 3 in., took me over to the West side of C. to an ice-cream parlor. This ice cream store resembled the store that I had been at in N. R., mirrors composed all four walls. The seats were blue leather with yellow additions. After we finished our ice cream we came to my house where we talked with my family. The dream ended at this point.
Interpretation
I do not know why I dream of this certain boy, B. This is the second time I have done so. It possibly means that unconsciously I want him to like me or visa versa. Since I have been in N. R. before and I loved it could this dream possibly signify that I should be there now? Whenever I bring a fellow back to the house we always talk to my family. Could this mean that my family dominates me?

I was all dressed in a white wedding gown about to march down the aisle. The woman fixed my train and I proceeded to march. I was very excited but very frustrated because my dress seams split on both sides just as I was half way down. I blushed and thought everyone would notice. I kept my arms at the side. I finally reached the altar but was nervous all the time because of the split seams. The ceremony was over and the reception started. The dream ended here.
Interpretation
I do have a white dress and recently had to fix the dress seam. The dressmaker cut the gown a little too low so I had to piece the white formal. It probably was on my mind as I applied this to a wedding gown, because of the wedding gown being white.

I was down at M. University with my two girlfriends, H. and H. These girls are around 20 and are very good friends of mine. We were in the dorm studying all night for an exam. Around midnight a lot of my friends came into the room. L. K. was wearing a black moire dress. She looked real slim and received many glances from M. B. Now this boy was an old flame of L. While all these people were in our room I started to put on a pair of brown suede shoes. At this time I woke up from my dream.
Interpretation
It is probable that I wish to be away at school with all my own close friends. This is typical college life which I probably unconsciously yearn for. The girl L. is a good friend of mine although in life she is chubby. Since I am chubby, could possibly wish that I might be slim someday. Probably this dream shows me how I must always have a crowd of people around me. The significance of brown suede shoes is not apparent to me.

It was a very clear day -- the day my sister who is 18 and I were to be married. We were coming down the two side aisles in the H.T. I went first with my father leading me and then my sister followed with my mother. We each had four bridesmaids and six ushers. This is a blurred image. We came simultaneously to the altar where all the attendants were displayed on both sides of the altar. The rabbi gave one speech for both of us and then the dream was gone.
Interpretation

I was at a circus one day. This circus had red and white tents. I was fascinated by the elephants and lions. They were all doing such cute tricks. While this was going on I was in the audience. The feature act was on next and I entered the wing in my gorgeous net costume. I took three bows and then proceeded to swing back and forth. The audience was enraptured but accidentally my foot didn't get hold of the lion rod, and I fell into the net. Here the dream ended.
Interpretation
I do not know what significance the red tent has but I could see it clearly. Obviously I want to be in the limelight but because of a few discrepancies on my part I do not exceed for long. This is probably in part some explanation of the dream. Maybe I am frustrated because I'm not excellent in sports although I love them. It could also mean I want to endanger my life.

I was in a dark forest picking flowers but I soon was bored so I laid down on the soft green grass. A black and white striped horse broke through the window and carried me away rather roughly.
Interpretation
Possibly this dream signifies my outlook on life. First I am content although realizing I'm not in satisfactory surroundings and then some obstacle always follows to throw off my happiness and contentment. The horse could have been the obstacle. The coming of the draft is a threat to my future happiness and I am frankly afraid. I don't know if this could tie in or not.

I was in Room --- at the time of my English Literature class. Miss W, my professor, was presiding when a girl entered requesting that I come to the office at once. This girl (who I cannot describe) barged in just as I was about to answer a question. I flew out of the room but this girl was not there, by the time I came to the door.
Interpretation
I dreamed this the night I was studying for my English exam. Probably in my unconscious I was recalling my last semester's class which I hated because of Miss W. The girl was just a figure for escape but one actually can't escape from his duty. I want to escape but it is hopeless.

I was in a large ballroom with many couples. We were all sitting around talking when N., my boyfriend who is 20 years old, said some nasty remarks. I was very surprised and I felt hurt all evening. The next thing I remembered I was in my house talking to L., N.'s friend, trying to inquire if N. meant what he said. He said he didn't know. The next thing I dreamed we were broken up. I went around asking everyone who I saw, "Is it true?"

I was in my high school gym watching a group of people roll dice. They were cartoon people - the kind in movie shorts - technicolor. There is an old man with an orange straw hat and a brown loafer jacket - also a colored boy with white teeth, purplish lips, a green turtle neck sweater, with a wool cap to match (orange tassle. Police, in uniform appear. The men pretend to be pitching horseshoes - but the police understand and catch the Negro. They put the orange horseshoes on him for handcuffs - and I realize that the horseshoes are really devises. We all go outside the gym and they do something to the Negro but I can't see what.
Interpretation
I can't, I wrote this - and no explanation came to mine. I have waited & reread it. The colored boy, for example, I can see his face and he resembles no one. The setting - very unreal - no one belongs. I can only interpret that this is a symbolism which my super ago refuses to recognize.

I went for a ride with J. (J.'s car, but I drove). I made a dangerous left turn across traffic, safely. Once we were on the less traveled road there were oil cans burning as danger signals.
The road we were on is quite well known - to me - about a mile from home. It seems to me: I reaiize that I am risking something by going out with J. Although I am absolutely in charge of the situation (I was driving) and capable of steering away from danger signs, I realize this is not a good road. (He kisses me - it's pleasant - we, neither of us pretends - I don't love him but I like to have him kiss me. Consciously I believe that this is satisfactory behavior by my standards but not by those of, say, my sister). You know what happens when you meet somebody on a secondary road under construction!

My father took me to a large department store; it was late and the store was quite empty. As I walked to our car to put part of the present into the trunk compartment (conveniently located on a high floor of the building - no?) - an old stooped lady reached to take some of my present. She failed to grasp it, but nevertheless I pursued her less she try again. We ran across a wine rug - she tried to trick me by dodging thru narrow doorways and behind chairs. Eventually she disappeared. I was pleased for she was gone for the time being. I returned. D. (who seems to me to have insight into people's actions - my father has no knowledge of him) was helping Father get lunch from the car. He tasted two milk bottles (with straws). They were sour; he discarded them. Father had also brought me a brand new camera with an expensive television attachment.
Interpretation
I wrote this on other paper as soon as I awakened. It is in my recopying that I have guessed a meaning.

I feel that my mother resents my affection for my father, and the feeling he has for me. Therefore I think it is she who is the old woman trying to snatch away the present - sign of his regard for me. And I realize, I guess that this menace can only be silenced temporarily.

With my first copy I guessed that - D. saw the milk (my mother - no?) and rejected it (her) because it would be harmful.

The camera was doubtless to satisfy jealous urges for my two roommates - both have cameras with flash attachments.

1. The old lady was feeble - therefore I could not harm her. (Honor thy father....)

That I was walking up the street of my hometown with a boy (1 yr older - known always - never dated - very good friend). I remember someone saying "How nice for them to be together!"
Interpretation
This remark seems wild. I never (consciously at least) wanted to date him. I think I was unconsciously striving to associate myself with a boy which my fanily knows and approves of. - A good home-town type - you know.

That my roommate confided in me that during the summer she met A. - he was searching for me and seeing her instead, he captured her. (Wearing a long black cape, he choked her and carried her away.) He confined her for the summer in his harem (He is a Moslem) where she was cruelly treated and given only ice cream to eat. He had many women & their boy children in this low ceilinged structure (the harem) and periodically went on forays for more captives. My roommate learned to love A. and since she was jealous of his love for me - she told me of the summer to arouse my jealousy. I accepted the recital, quite calmly.
Interpretation
He is to me foreign. From another country etc. etc. he is very much the opposite of anyone I have known or understood. Being a high caste Moslem - he is entitled to more than one wife at a time. He is exceedingly attractive; I have always imagined that he has at least had opportunities to seduce other women.

Ice cream was something we always ate together. This seems to strengthen the theme that my roommate was a substitute.

The low ceilings - I am rather tall - he does not like me to wear high heels. Also - they give the set-up a more furtive atmosphere.

Her jealousy would of course give me pride and satisfaction. I crave approval.

Answers to questions
2. I accepted my roommates tale because the reality seemed less difficult to face than the doubts I have heretofore endured.

I. and I went swimming. I had never been to this wild, deserted lake. She left after a few minutes, saying she would come back. She never did; I swam - kept busy- G. finally appeared - and took me back. (G. is the type person you cultivate because he sustains your pride-ego-self satisfaction. He convinces me I'm wonderful. I haven't seen him for a while - 90 he came in a dream & said the same things).
Interpretation
The three of us were at a camp for crippled children two summers ago. I. & I were in charge of eight little girls. I never did any of her work except swimming instruction. My pride is reinforced by G.'s reminders, whenever I see him, that I "did all the work." I had just seen I. - she is being married. I envy her that - and this dream made me feel, I guess, that, after all, I am "better" than she is, anyway.

Answers to questions
2. I didn't mind doing the work at camp. - and the motivation of praise made it more enjoyable. When G. came, he accused I. of deserting me - distinctly pleasurable.

A girl and her little baby named Jo (I unconsciously wrote that spelling when I recorded the dream that night. Sex of Jo never came up again). came to swim where I was sunbathing. It was on a large rock in a lake in Canada. (I spent my vacation at such a place). Girl said she would take me to R. (I want to go there - to see a girl who "jilted" one of my best friends). Girl told me about mauve, long spined animal who might try to eat us if it saw us bathing there. I was amused. They (Girl & Jo) were terrified when it appeared and slid under a ledge. THIS CONTINUES IN MY NEXT SHEET--THEY AREN'T THE SAME DREAM, QUITE--YET THEY'RE CONNECTED.
Interpretation
The animal didn't frighten me at first. I was secure in the warm (SUN). But when girl started to abandon the warmth, for a cold ledge and safety, I came too. If this warmth signifies sexual pleasure, I will bask in it until other people say that cold safety is preferable. Then I am forced to abandon my pleasure and assume the attitude (of fear, which I say is "beneath me", as a protective device. I say "oh the animal will hurt me - I must flee" and thus project on to this animal my own fears of myself. I forgot to tell you that the ledge was so confining - while wide - there was barely enough height for me to lie flat - certainly none to spare. obvious isn't it?

I could not hide under a ledge. There was no room for me. I crawled on and ended up under the bed. It was in a neat, shiny house. The floors were quite polished. The "animal" was now an ape. He tried to snatch my feet from under the bed and eat them. He left periodically, and I was able to "boost" my companions through the window to safety. He came back and closed the window so it would be harder for me to get out. Ape left and returned with friend who was a man. They decided to let me get away. I woke up.
Interpretation
It was a low built bed. There were springs in my face. The neat shiny house - my home. My mother is fanatic about cleanliness (I know - anal sublimation - but she does it anyway). Natch, that I want to escape from home - The animal is eventually close to a man - because it seems that only marriage will really free me from home (and that is only a degree of freedom, huh?) Oh, my feet! They are enormous! I realize that so far I have been able to help people - but for myself - I must go alone. If the ape is my father - he knows I can get through the window, but he is not above putting obstacles in my way. (See, in the end he yields). I realize my mother only appeared through the symbol of "neat house" but in interpretation - she is always there.

Answers to questions
1. The ape is old - sure - wise. (I was almost through my interpret. till I realized it is Father.)
2. Damn frustrating - just to get to the window and have that ape come back.
3. Actual participant
4. Frustrating, I said.
5. There were white ruffled curtains - my mother's passion - and braided rugs - we have dozens. (Yet - it wasn't any actual room in our house. I confess - sublimation)
6. No.
7. There were blue veins showing through the skin of the ape (I know apes have hair all over their bodies - but my ape is special!)

I dreamed that I was in my methods class - about 6 boys & 15 girls. Suddenly - a lot more men entered the class - followed by a number of freshman girls. Since it is a "300" course, I could not understand the young girls; I was very resentful. I had the feeling inside me - I hope there has been an error and we can revert to the original.
Interpretation
Is it that I so resent the freshman girl in my dormitory - who is trying her best to date a fellow (J.) I date? Even though I date other people (the entering men) do I begrudge losing anything I consider mine? (J.) I interpret that I have a very selfish desire to keep J. and the method I shall use is to convince him that she is too young.

(And upon consideration, it seems like the unconscious did some pretty clear thinking.)

In H. a woman, former GI nurse, was playing a record player like I want She said she found it on the steps of the Medical Library. The nurse said she likes to walk around - the campus alone at night - I thought "she wants a man, but that's not the best way" - She said she got $65. a month - and as for that being enough, she said, "I may do it." I jokingly said, "You may, but can you?" No one laughed. (Pardon me - I don't know where the audience came from either). Instead of laughing, my roommate said "You have no appreciation of other people's problems." I didn't answer, but instead explained the joke to P. who was kind and encouraging.
Interpretation
g.i. nurse: J. had been telling me what a fool I'd be to enlist if war came. He insulted W.A.C.'s in general. medical library: I had just seen pictures of it that day, and wanted to go. record player: the motion attracts me. "You may": because I intend to teach English, I am fearful lest I get too fussy about details. roommate: because she was mad at her boyfriend, she had unleashed her terrible temper on me - told me I could not teach as I didn't know about people.

I dreamed I was walking down B. Road, by myself, when a car pulled up and said, "Hello, S." That's the name my family has for me and I walked to the car. There were three fellows all tall and good-looking whom I recognized as being people I knew well - but I didn't think of them separately. They drove me home and after I walked inside I knew they were J., a nephew on my father's side - J., a cousin on my mother's side - and J., my sister's fiance.
Interpretation
I am dating a man - have been for some time. When I announced to my roommate that I am to see his parents soon, she said, "They are quite foreign.... I think they changed their name." I was furious "That makes no difference," I said emphatically - but just before I went to sleep I mentally checked all his relatives I have met, to see if they seemed "foreign."

My roommate's "man" proposed to me - told me he loved me, and would prove it but I must go and get my roommates scarf to wear, for we were going to the H. for dinner. I remembered it was 11:30 at night and I had to be in at 1. So I didn't think this was quite like the man as I knew him - so I went inside.

I dreamed of strings of light bulbs - Christmas tree bulbs of multi colors - all following one another about in the darkness. The lights circled wildly in the air - and since the confusion of colors annoyed me - the strings obligingly similar - all one green string and all one yellow, etc. I loved watching. Sometimes they seemed to be on a merry-go-round - and you couldn't see the ponies, but just the lights going around. Other time9 the light9 were on a Christmas tree and the strings proceeded (gaily ?) up and do~n the branches.

I dreamed of a circus - made of sequins and rhinestones. It was all exotic colors - no plain blues or yellows - but magenta & chartreuse & aqua - I watched a merry-go-round - all dazzling & glittering. I seemed to be far off and seeing - just enjoying watching - and not darinng to go closer.
Interpretation
I see this as being my cynical skeptical point of view. I did not dare go too close - I was all alone and I was afraid that if I saw too clearly - the beauty would vanish. Instead I knew (and I realize now that this is my customary attitude) that the really exotic world melt upon inspection.

Also, I see all this in another light. I have the habit of tearing down the idealistic and the consequent disappointment when the materialistic is less appealing (in that is has lost its glamour) I have in the last few days, lost my credulity of the charm of a particular love affar - I know that it wasn't the romantic interlude that I made it be in my mind - I can now realize that he didn't love me as I would like to believe - and I feel wistful that it can't be the sequined violet & carmine story I liked.

I seem to get mired in words - "I know he didn't love me in the way I hoped he did - and it hurts - and I would like to regress to my naive belief - and I realize that I had to keep quite distant from the situation to believe anything so foolish.

I was home sitting on the love seat with I. Mother came in, and I felt awkward about introducing him, the form of "I'd like you...". Then Father came, I forgot I.'s name; Father had on his bifocals and seemed to be squinting. Finally, desperately, his name came. The scene closed abruptly.
Interpretation
I had difficulty explaining I. at all - even to my roommates. He is not the type of person to be subtle about - and I don't care to tell my parent about his realism.

The red love seat is of course interesting since the color is the only nice thing about it. It's quite uncomfortable.

You see, I wouldn't "like you to meet" - although I realize that my Father wouldn't see clearly the personality traits that if he did recognize, he'd distrust.

In addition, his name itself is Jewish - and this is a factor that would affect my parents.

I was out in a large pond behind my real home. We were pouring plaster of paris in the lake (or pond) from our small rowboat, in an attempt to hasten the freezing over. Finally we realized that even though the water was completely full of plaster of paris, there would still be difficulties - for before my eyes, the water became brown cement. Buildings were still protruding thru the cement, a white church steeple and the ridge pole of a garage. In addition, the wind was blowing, and so the cement was too uneven to skate on.
Interpretation
I think that I am hinting to myself what "the future has in store for me."

I have freedom of movement in the boat - but I crave the security of firmer ground - so I try to make this water firmer - thru plaster of Paris.

When I can & do get what I am seeking - that security - it may be firmer than I wish - already formed, wlth the irrevocable ridges that the wind made - and the other sides of my personality as hopelessly enmashed as the church & garage.

Currently I am considering marriage - but I am afraid of the independence I needs surrender.

We (all the girls I know at school) were in the Stunt- Stunt Night. The stunts were going on, and ended. All was confusion - people - noise. My father was there (unexplainedly). Finally it was time to go back to the dorm to change clothes for the dance. One girl and I were going to the dorm when I suddenly realized that I hadn't seen my date all evening. I was lost - afraid - lonely.
Interpretation
Life to me so far has been enjoyably confusing - and my father and my friends have been there to make it pleasant. There comes this transition point where I must "change clothes" - "get ready for the dance" - and I am lonely - & afraid. Where is the man?

I am across the street, in our neighbor's. She has several small children - one is a pretty blonde girl who I make a fuss over. (This is the house I was born in). I am tearing up bread crumbs (I had to do this in cooking class today and remembered doing it for my mother). The little girl wanted me to come & play but I couldn't because a fellow I date was upstairs in the bathroom, and I was waiting for him. Finally fellow came down - he had become someone else.* He came in, grasping neighbor's hand, & her father's hand, firmly. From then on he seems to wander, being either L. or P. without much discrimination. The little blonde girl & her sister & 2 brothers are going to a party, and leave, all bundled up. They all disappear - trouping into the fraternity house across the street - blonde leading.
Interpretation
I like two men - one is my childhood sweetheart, a member of the fraternity mentioned - the other is a stranger - someone who must be endlessly introduced.

Bread - the symbol of life - of "My body" - I am tearing up while I sit waiting.

The little girl wants to play - but instead must go on a date - desire to regress?

The firm handshake & its meanings were recently discussed by my friends. "Firm" is a good sign.

Little girl goes into fraternity house - and she is I - little blonde girl is what I was when I lived there.There is a very subtle similarity between the two - they are both kind & loving, but I'm afraid of the routineness of life with either of them.

Conclusion - I am confused.

I dreamed that I was coming home from a dance - my date was sick & one of his friends had to bring me home. En route home, this friend, who does not resemble anyone I know became quite amorous, frightening me. I finally got back to the dorm; came in a door (which actually does not exist - seemed to be cut through the wall).
Interpretation
This dream occurred right after I had been to a dance - my date had a headache.

My date has a very charming & attractive friend - and it was not until I rewrote this on this sheet of paper (copying it from the record I made at the time) that I knew it is he. It did not have his face - I think I didn't dare recognize him - but he had on a blue suit - and that symbolizes this individual to me Evidently his actions are wish-fulfillment.

I was in H. Fellow I know left an elaborate set of drums sitting there. I went over and sat down. The drums were against the wall - so I turned my back on everyone & began to play. I am absolutely ignorant of drum playing technique. I tried each drum and then I just hit them in a rhythm which was good. I leaned back, satisfied, and reaching for a cigarette - got the pipe which I saw "owner of the drums" smoking yesterday. I took a drag, not realizing; it tasted good. Friend of "owner of drums" - stranger - appeared. He liked the way I played the drums. We had conversation which seemed quite clever, but slips my mind. He could play the drums & showed me how.
Interpretation
Owner of the drums goes to C. - yet has wonderful musical & social talents. He seems quite unhappy. He therefore comes to H. to be appreciated. and I suppose a reason I like him is that I would like to identify myself with his musical ability.

I turned my back on the audience. People comment on my (real, not imagined) lack of musical ability. But one man heard me - and appreciated me - laughed with my that I was smoking the pipe - made clever conversation - is an optimistic sign.

While at camp last summer, I had a recurrent dream that I would forget my mother's birthday, which would occur while I was away from home, and for which I would not be able to get home.
In one of these dreams I had forgotten to call or write greetings for her birthday, and when I returned home found she had died. My father, to console himself, was reading "The Bird's Xmas Carol." I took the book from him, to read it myself. In the manner of dreams, however, I read ahead of the print, and it was meaningless.

I had a feeling of great remorse at my mother's death, and felt a stronger love for her than I had ever known while she was alive.

The dream left a strong impression, and even now, when I think of it, experience a feeling of great tenderness toward my mother.

Interpretation
I do not know why I worried in my dream about forgetting my mother's birthday, for I had looked forward for several weeks to calling her and talking to her.

The "Bird's Xmas Carol" reminded me of a similar incident that happened when I was ten and in the 5th grade, our teacher, just before Christmas vacation, read the story to our class, and while she read it, I experienced the same feeling of love and tenderness toward my mother. I remember running home from school at lunch time to see if she were all right.

I was floating in Lake Erie, and although I did not recognize the site, I had this firm conviction it was off 72nd street. As I floated further out, the land took on the appearance of the Shore Drive, except that it ran diagonally from 72nd St. to E. 9th, which seemed a great deal further inland than it actually is. I drifted farther out with apparent unconcern until I noticed the water was becoming scummy and filled with debris. I then became alarmed and thrashed around in the water, but became tired quickly and ceased to struggle, continuing to float.
Interpretation
Evidently the floating indicates a feeling of security, and the momentary struggle indicates grappling with the cause of the feeling of insecurity, which in this dream was represented by the floating debris. The floating sensation in itself, however, was most pleasant.

This dream was a series of disconnected events, and through its entirety I was strongly aware that I was engaged, and kept constantly twisting my diamond ring around my finger with the thumb of the same hand.
I watched my fiance greet a friend of his by shaking his hand and pounding his friend's hand exuberantly. As a gift, he brought me an expensive pair of eye glass frames in an elaborate glass-case, instead of merely having the frames adjusted, as I had requested. On another occasion, I was sitting on a narrow steel bar about six feet above the ground, discussing my engagement with several friends below me. They later, to my bewilderment, claimed to have known nothing about it, but when I mentioned his name, their enthusiastic replies were how lucky it was that my fiance did not have flat feet!

Interpretation
This dream, I am sure, is a natural result of a tired, active mind as it works during sleep. There was no organization and comparatively little imagination in it--it is only a slight elaboration and pictorialization of thoughts that had come to my mind during the day. Almost all the details can be matched to actual trends of thought.

Outside factors had probably made themselves felt; the engagement ring in the dream was actually a ring I had found during that day which I had believed lost and which I wore to bed. Perhaps my dream-act of sitting on the steel bar above my friends, however, was a subconscious feeling of superiority to them.

The only person in the dream whom I can actually identify was a friend whom I had seen to talk to that day for the first time in several months. And my fiance, in my dream, was actually a boy whom I had known for several weeks a year or so previously, and had not thought of since that time.

2. There was really a lack of emotion during the dream; apathy would probably best describe how I felt.

4. Absolutely neither. It made me neither happy nor unhappy.

Two girl friends and myself, dressed in bathing suits, entered Hotel C. by the Public Square entrance, and crowded into a self-operated elevator to go to the 10th floor. There was already another person in the elevator, who wanted to get off at the 8th floor. There was some difficulty with the push button, and, after going up, we started to descend again. There was a moment of confusion after which the elevator began its slow ascent again. I had a sensation of claustrophobia.
The swimming pool was in amphitheatre arrangement, with tiers of seats that sloped down to the pool itself. The water, however, looked heavy and thick, and was of a deep blue-green black color, altogether unpleasant. Ahead of my friends, I went down the right aisle to the pool. I started to dive in, but a scream from my friends stopped me; they explained to me that there were five baby pigs at the end of the pool. To get to the other side, it was necessary to go back up the step-aisle and pass in front of the spectators scattered around the "theatre." Among them were several boys of my own age, who guffawed loudly at the mistake I had made. With heavy sarcasm and some anger I "fraw hawed" back at them. When I had passed, I had the uneasy feeling that they must have thought I was crazy.

At the left end I dived into the pool, and to be sure I did not encounter the pigs, followed a girl in a yellow bathing suit who was swimming in front of me. The pool was divided into several sections by what resembled a clothes rope. I continually entangled myself in these ropes as I tried to swim over them. At this point of the dream I learned that the little pigs were a part of a game provided by the management for its guests; if somebody swam into or near the "pig pen," the crib arrangement in which they were kept would overturn and they would be at freedom in the pool, and swimmers in turn, would be forced to use the pigs' former crib if they did not want to swim with the pigs.

Interpretation
This dream followed a whole day of intensive study with out a break. I still had not finished my work, however and as I went to bed I worried about finishing it. This may have some bearing on the dream.

The swimming I believe hinges on the fact that twice a week, for an hour or so, I swim at the C. Club. There is a self-operated elevator there, which also has a tendency to get stuck.

The incident of being ridiculed by the boys, I imagine, is my fear of that very thing.

The amphitheatre arrangement may be explained by the fact that I have lately been a spectator myself at several swim meets, looking down from the side to the pool.

It was an especially bleak day and I was walking with a friend of mine (girl) along the path around W Park Lagoon. I was carrying a flat, blunted rock. My friend stepped down from the path to test the ice in the lagoon, and I realized I was tired of carrying the rock. I let it go, and without my intending it to, it struck my friend in the back. She fell to the ice, evidently unconscious, and a deep, black hole appeared in her back. I had a feeling of horror but helplessness. At this point of the dream events became confused, but when they cleared, I was lying on the path, pretending either that I was ill or had fainted, and several of my friends (girls, whom I remember as knowing but cannot now identify) was standing around me, discussing how I should be punished for having injured my friend.
Interpretation
To hit my friend with a rock, even if accidentally done in the dream, would probably indicate repressed hostility toward her, although I can think of no reason for that feeling. Pretending to be unconscious, as an escape mechanism, seemed to be a familiar feeling in the dream. Perhaps it stems from an occasion when I was in elementary school, and, being pelted by snowballs from a tomboy school acquaintance, fell down in a snowbank and pretended to have been injured. This dream recalled the incident to my mind after having forgotten about it for several years.

Answers to questions

This is a dream which I believe I have had, in some form or another, at another time; I experienced the "This is where I came in" feeling throughout it.
Several girl friends and myself were driving home from downtown. I was sitting on somebody's lap and feeling in good spirits; one of the girls, however, was sound asleep, her head resting against a window.

The home at which we arrived was at the top of a hill on a very wooded, mountainous section of Virginia. I was standing on the porch (complete with white pillars) and there was a young soldier with me. I had the feeling he was one of the "test tube" soldiers of Ft. Knox; he was very young and wearing a clean, well-pressed uniform, and had red hair. I believe we were waiting for breakfast. He said something to me, and we went to the back of the house. It seems he has wanted to burn rubbish, but the fire had spread to the whole hill, and to hills beyond. There was a great deal of smoke in the air, but I could see no fire.

We returned to the house. In the front center hall, when we entered, was a discussion as to what to do. A woman evidently the owner, decided to open the paddock to free the horses, so somebody, with several dogs, set them free.

In the next action I was a spectator, and the dream took on a motion-picture semblance. The horses were fleeing wildly, and there were several palaminoes I noticed especially.

All I can really explain is about the soldier and the fire. I had read several articles at that time of the Fort Knox experiment, which interested me.

The fire, I believe, is more important. When I was much younger I used to have nightmares about fire, always in our own home. A fire would start in our attic, I would dream, and sweep thru the house, destroying everything.

This fear of fire I can trace to two sources: first, that my father often became angry with me when he found my toys strewn about the attic, and he often mentioned the possibility of fire. Secondly, for many years our house was next to a wooded, grassy field where field fires in dry summer were a potential danger. My childhood dreams of a fire were very vivid and terrifying and on at least one occasion I got out of bed and went to the attic to see if all was well.

I think probably the above dream was that old fear in a new garb.

The dream was a brief one, but caused me a great deal of anxiety. I dreamed it was a Wednesday afternoon, and I was scheduled to attend two things at four o'clock: a water safety course and a sorority meeting. I decided, however, that I wanted to go home and did so. At six o'clock, however, I was horrified; I had failed to attend a water safety class upon which my summer job depended, and a sense of obligation told me I should have attended the meeting.
Even after I awoke, I felt a sense of anxiety over my escapist action.

Interpretation
Toward the end of every semester I begin to dream of two things; of cutting classes or forgetting to attend them and being penalized for it and of being unable to remember a single thing on the final examination.

Actually, I have been faced with the above problem of two important activities scheduled at the same time, and my dream decision of chucking the both by at once and deciding to go home, probably indicates wishful thinking of the same.

Supposedly next summer, I had returned to the camp where I actually counseled last summer, although it did not in the least resemble that place, but rather my aunt's farm in Virginia, which is in rolling country. There were only four or five of us counselors there and we were to organize a pre-camp training course. I cannot now remember the other dream characters, (although I knew them in the dream) except one who is a friend of mine here at school. It was a very rainy, dark, dreary day when we arrived, and while we were unpacking, when our camp director assigned us jobs and I was to gather firewood, I asked, intending to be facetious, "dry firewood?" When the director looked scornful at that remark, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. As I unpacked my unusually large suitcase I discovered at the bottom dozens of candles of all sizes. I did not know why they were there, but realized they would be useful at the "final banquet," a tradition and quite an occasion.
I also discovered many sweaters -- sweaters I have had for years, and I was glad to see them, for I was cold and wet. As I stood there, in my slip, I looked down the hill to the road and saw a man in an automobile driving past and staring up at me. It made me quite angry.

Interpretation
I have been preparing to return to camp this summer, and during the week of this dream had been busy filling out application blanks and writing to counselors I had known there last year. The directyor in the dream has since resigned and been replaced. The feeling of inadequacy with her I had occasionally felt, but it was not a constant feeling.

Candles seem to be a source of anxiety--for some reason it seems I am constantly having to get them for occasions; parties, concerts, birthdays, etc., and very often have forgotten them or been unable to buy them. They may have represented a feeling of frustration. Firewood seems to be another frustration symbol, for keeping it dry was of prime importance, and I was often mildly bothered about it at camp, fearing it would get wet and we would be unable to have a fire.

I was walking down a ramp with a strong feeling of having done something of great importance. As I walked along, one woman said to another (although I was not conscious of seeing either) that mine would have made the sixth abdication in a century. I had a feeling then of belonging to English royalty.
As I went into the street, it was raining, and I had to walk carefully, for it was very slippery. It was at night, and the lights from the shops on the streets reflected on the wet pavement. I began to cry, and a friend of mine came up to me to beg me not to commit suicide. I assured her that I wouldn't, saying that a five-minute walk in the rain would fix me up completely. I then lay down on the pavement and cried and cried.

Interpretation
My act of abdication produced in me a most intense feeling somewhere between the martyristic and brave "I can take it" attitude. My friend who begged me not to commit suicide, I realize, has appeared before in a minor part in a recent dream. I do not know why, for I see her seldom, and am not on intimate terms with her, although we have known each other since kindergarten days.

The walking down a ramp, which I was sure it was although it more resembled the balcony in my high school gym, is not surprising, for the day before the dream I had ushered at two operas and had been stationed on one of the auditorium ramps.

There was a young girl, whom I judged to be about seven years old and whom I felt was a playmate of my sister (although my sister is now sixteen), visiting our house. She was a very ragged, dirty and unkempt child, which bothered me considerably. I took her to her home, which was the lower half of a double house on a street not far from ours, and found the place in a deplorable messy condition. We went through several rooms, all of which seemed to be furnished in living-room style, to the kitchen in the back. The kitchen too, was in an abhorrable state; dishes of food from several previous meals was lying around, which rather nauseated me. Just inside the door of the dining room was the refrigerator ("x"). [There is a diagram in the original dream report.] I peered into it, and the heat from the inside hit me in the face. It was revolting, I thought, to have butter and milk and eggs kept in a warm icebox! The little girl, meanwhile, had been unobtrusively following me around. I thought a splendid thing to do would be to clean the whole place thoroughly, and I had the feeling that by doing so I would greatly impress someone whom I wanted to make a good impression upon.
Evidently we made a good job of it, for the little girl thanked me profusely, and mentioned that her older brothers, as well as the two boys who lived upstairs, would certainly admire me for doing such a good job of cleaning!

Interpretation
The young girl reminded me of a schoolmate I had in the first year or two of elementary school. She had about the same appearance as my dream child, and although I never knew of her home life, I knew she was one of six children. Often I would bring her home from school to have lunch with me, and once I gave her a penny that my "boy friend" had given me. (I had not thought of this for years; thinking about the dream brought back these incidents).

To clean up a place in such a condition as her home was would probably be my natural tendency to do so; perhaps the dream indicates that I really want to be admired for this tendency.

I was standing on our upstairs back porch watching some sort of an air show in the sky. Although it was night, I could see a blimp in its entirety, silver-colored, and a legend or advertisement or news bulletins running around it. I squinted and peered to try to read what it was, but could not.
There were several airplanes sky-writing, and doing it in a very graceful sweeps across the sky. I also tried to read what they were writing, but the smoke evaporated or disintegrated before I could read the words.

In spite of all this aerial activity, there was no noise. I then became cold and sat in the corner of the porch, huddled up, trying to keep warm.

Interpretation
Earlier in the evening of the dream I had seen the Goodyear blimp which has lately been floating over C. at night, flashing news reels along its side in Times-Square fashion, so, obviously, that is where the "dream blimp" came from.

My not being able to read it probably springs from the fact that I am near--sighted and would not be able to see it without my glasses. I have noticed in other dreams, however, when trying to read a book the print sort of melts away before I can see what it says.

The sky-writing of the planes, which was fluffy, pastel-colored stuff, may have come from a package of shipping-cream dye I had bought that day. And I awakened shortly after the dream to find I had kicked the covers off, which explains my feeling cold in the dream.

I was in a long, rather elaborate corridor which was brilliantly lighted by crystal chandeliers. There was a punch table around which many people were gathered, and groups were standing and walking around, giving an impression of constant activity. This was, I knew, a fraternity social affair. My date, however, seemed constantly to run off, returning later but giving me an uneasy feeling of being left alone. One of his quick trips back to me, he asked "how's O.?" and I felt surprised that he should know O.
I met a girl who was also alone, and the two of us went back to an elaborate lounge. After some muddled activity, I was back in the living room of my own home, and the mother of a friend (boy) of mine was asking me to give her a wide silver filigree bracelet that I own.

Interpretation
In retrospect this dream seems to be confusingly active; the activity, that is, of people constantly milling around. The corridor-like setting seemed very large, but because of the many people, was not vast.

My date, I presumed in the dream, was gotten for me by a friend of mine who is actually in the fraternity, and whose mother it was who later asked me for the bracelet. I do not know how I know it was his mother in the dream, for I have met her but once, and would not recognize her if I saw her again, I am sure. My surprise at being asked "how O. was" springs from the fact that I did not know that my date was not gotten for me by my fraternity friend, but my date was instead a friend of O. O., incidentally, is my "unrequited."

At a social gathering, seemingly in somebody's attic, I was introduced to a man with whom I danced, a person whom I have seen in school but do not know. At an intermission there was some sort of a program in which three girls, dressed in formal gowns, sang, sitting down. They were quite informal about it, giggling and glancing about as they sang. One girl I vaguely know as being in one of my classes, was wearing a yellow formal--the only color in the dream. One of the girls has moved recently to California (the two vaguely physically resemble one another). On the other side of the trio, still another girl (B) got up and left, saying she felt embarrassed because her skirt was too short.
The couple with whom my partner and I were evidently double-dating, was a high school friend of mine who has since married and whom I have not seen since her wedding. As we drove home from the dance my dancing partner changes to a youth whom I have never seen. As he left me at my door in broad daylight, he hastily shook my hand, as I opened the door, and left. My mother was awaiting me at the top of the stairs.

Interpretation
On the day of this dream I had looked forward to a call from the fellow with whom I have gone rather steadily for several months, realizing that if I did not hear from him, I would probably not see him again. As he did not call, I began to search about in my mind for someone to take to a forthcoming dance. Probably in my dream, I was continuing to do the same thing. My dancing partner, although I do not actually know his marital status, probably in that he was married during the dream, represents some sort of a guilt feeling.

I had been married two days and, at the time, was cleaning a house which I did not recognize as any I had ever been in before, but one in which I felt perfectly comfortable. My mother was directing me, as she does at home, and I was working vigorously. I had no idea, at this time, of anyone else in my family, such as Dad or my 2 older brothers. I hadn't seen my husband for 2 days, but I felt that I could make it up to him and I was determined to try.
Interpretation
The idea of marriage has been mentioned frequently in my dorm; and, I remember we were discussing its possibilities the night before. Mother's position in my dream was probably due to the fact I know she doesn't want me to marry till I'm through college.

I dreamed I was on the shore of a small lake with a hill rising about ten feet in back of me. A girl was with me and one I did know. A "C.B." type of plane was stunting over the water and headed straight towards the girl and I. I was afraid and ran to the hill and back against it, but my friend was not afraid and she stayed by the shore; the plane zoomed up just in time to miss the hill. Then the plane landed and two men, rather good looking but none I'd seen before, stepped from the plane into a small boat and rowed towards us. Next scene we were in a hotel and they were there--here I woke up.
Interpretation
I can think of no reason to dream this other than the fact I ate some cheese just before retiring, which has been the cause of some peculiar dreams before. I am interested in flying and the C.B. is my favorite type plane.

I dreamed I was at a huge party in some palacial ballroom that I have never seen before. The party seemed to be in my honor and I stood out in the crowds of people as if spotlights were playing on me at all times. No one came near me for there was a circle of about 15 feet where no one stood, about me and yet I was vastly happy. It reminded me of a scene in Il Trovadore during the duet.

I was at a beach party with many people I knew, yet I felt lonely because the fellow I had come with had gone back to the car for something forgotten. It was a very black night with a haze over the water about 1/4 of a mile out. I wanted to swim into the haze and I knew I was a good enough swimmer to do it, but I was afraid of what was beyond the haze. I swam out to it and forced myself to go into it. It covered me like a blanket and I quickly returned to shore really afraid.
Interpretation
I like to swim and in the water I like to go far and it pleases me to make other people get mad or anxious by doing this.

I dreamed I wished to be married and everyone was happy about the ceremony except me. Although I wanted to be married, I felt I was going against something or somebody. I felt guilty. Then suddenly my father tried to choke me to death. He was very composed. He showed no emotion while choking me. I wasn't afraid of death, but of my father. To be a little clearer, I was more afraid of having made my father angry, then being killed myself.
Interpretation
I have no immediate desire to get married because I know Dad and Mom would like me to finish college. I can't interpret this dream because I know Dad would agree and never say anything if I wanted to get married.

I dreamed I was at a dinner party. The fellow I have been going steady with was there also and many others who I could not recognize. A girl came up to talk to me and accidently made a faux-pax by saying she had been on a date with G., my steady. G. heard her and made no explanation, but looked only hostile. Unseen, I left the dinner party and walked out the front door of Dr. Bacon's house at the P. Andy, a fellow I had dated came walking up the driveway smiling. Even though I knew he could help me, I walked around the house away from him.
Interpretation
I had been to a dinner party the night before and had a wonderful time. The complications of the dream must be an unconscious fear G. is unfaithful.

I dreamed G. my steady, and I were at a party of G's friends. I was having a gay hilarious time. Suddenly, G left and I was left alone in this strange house. I wandered around till I found the kitchen where I heard lots of noise. I pushed open the door and everyone was there and they all made a big fuss over my absence. I felt the need to be comforted, yet I was afraid to go to G. because I knew he didn't like public displays of affection. So I stood across the room from him and laughed, feeling vocable.
Interpretation
There are many times when I feel very lonely but try not to show it. And I dislike G's friends but do not show it, yet I always have a good time at the parties the friends give about twice a month.

I dreamed I was driving down town to get a book I had left in some store. One of the girls in my History of Art class rushed up to the car and gave me the book. (girl about 20) The next thing I knew I was in a large room full of people I seemed to know. An old friend that I had gone through high school with was telling everyone how to cut their hair.
Interpretation
I had been rather worried about getting an Art book as the U--- book store was out of them. The girl in my class had told me to try down town. I really have no idea where the second part of my dream came from except that I have been thinking about cutting my hair.

I dreamed I was at a party. There were many people crowded around an extremely long tea table. As I started to talk to the people who were about my age (M & F 20-25) my teeth began to drop out. One by one each tooth fell out and soon my face started to fold.
Interpretation
I had just had x-rays taken of my teeth and I was afraid one or two of them might have to come out. I had been chewing gum Just before I went to bed and perhaps the gum stimulated certain tissues which might have cause such a dream.

I dreamed that J---(M 22--engaged to me) and I went to visit two of our friends who were just married. They were living in an old house similar to one I visited when a child. G--- (M 23)was sitting in the living room and there were two huge rats sitting in front of the fire place. I said something to M--- L--- (F 23) about the house and she said "you should have seen it before we moved in. Then one of the rats jumped into G---'s lap.
Interpretation
The dream probably grew out of a letter I had just received from M--- L---. I am not too fond of G--- and I guess I class him with big ugly rats. The statement made by L--- is typical of the way she always stands behind anything G--- does. I can not place the house but it seems to recall unpleasant memories.

J--- (engaged to M 22) and I were on our way E--- Beach but first we had to meet several women (F 60-70). These older women were sitting on a sofa with their heads cut off. We went up some stairs and got into a roller coaster car. The tracks were covered with small fire crackers which started to go off when we came to the end of the ride. We got back in the car and some-one called to us and asked us to take a boy we had never seen before to the doctor. Several other young people (20-25) got into the car and I woke up.
Interpretation
The women with their heads cut off probably gained entrance into my dream by the plate in my art book of the statue of the three fates. The fire crackers at E--- Beach came from my memory of the times my parents used to take me there on the Fourth of July. The young people were probably just the wish to meet more young people.

There was a message in my room to call Dr. T--- because he wanted my reports on my leadership group. I went down into the trunk room to look for the reports and found them in a trunk. Suddenly several of the girls were down there with me and we were studying for a psychology test.
Interpretation
My H. year book arrived in the afternoon. I was thinking when I went to bed about how nice it could be to go back for my diploma over a week-end so I could see all the people who had not graduated. Often on Sunday evenings after ten thirty we studied our psychology in the trunk room.

Before I went to bed I gave mother some money I owed her and we had a very difficult time coming out even. I was thinking when I went to sleep about how nice it would be to be working and earn my own money. When I worked at H. Bros I earned about twenty dollars and it came in an envelope.

I dreamed I was riding my bike up a steep hill. The path I was following became very narrow and then suddenly my bike fell over the cliff and I started to loose my balance. When I awoke I was trying to grab something to hold on to.
Interpretation
I believe this dream represents the conflict between growing up and remaining young. I had seen a bike in the afternoon and thought how much fun it would be to ride around the block on it again.

I dreamed I was in the room of an old house which over looked a wide river. The river was very high almost to the edge of the wide windows facing the water. I went out of the house and got into a boat and sailed back and forth in front of the wide windows. Suddenly there was thunder and rain. The house melted away. The woman who owned the house--(the mother of one of my friends) drove her car to the river's edge and I got in. There was another clap of thunder and I awoke.
Interpretation
The setting of the dream probably originated from the pictures of some of Frank Lloyd Wright's houses which I had been looking at before I went to bed. The mother of my friend probably originated in my dream because while at school I saw the plans of a building designed by Wright whlch they have bought and are planning to build soon. The thunder was probably the sound of the truck backing into our drive just before I awoke.

In my dream I was trying to buy colored blocks to fit into a wall panel I was able to buy and fit all the blocks except one with out which the whole design would fall apart.
Interpretation
The general plan of the dream may have come from the difficulty I have had working with the panel in a radio cabinet J. and I are building or a game of chinese checkers I played before going to bed. The one block that wouldn't fit was probably an expression of an Id impulse against the formal design.

I was in a foreign land living in a strange house with a very blonde girl. All of my friends seemed to live in this country too. There were two troops of soldiers also in the town who were friendly with each other although they seemed to be from different nations. one troop dressed in white uniforms and wore black turbans while the other troop wore khaki. My fiance belonged to the khaki group of soldiers. For some unknown reason the troops began to fight and those in khaki formed two lines--the first kneeling, and the second standing behind them. This made a perfect target for the troop in white, and in the fight my fiance was shot and killed. When I heard, I was grief stricken and especially because I was unhappy living with the blonde girl, and also had received bad news from my mother. The blonde continually stole my potato chips which angered me. The bad news was that my dog was very ill and my uncle had given him a blood transfusion. I was very upset.
Another elderly man had also given blood for my dog although the animal was not expected to live. (My uncle has been dead for about 8 years and he was about 71 when he died. He was not a blood relative, but lived for years with my mother's family and I always called him Uncle. He was very kind to me. The other elderly gentleman I cannot identify. My dog has been dead about 1-1/2 years and was 12 years old when he died. I cannot identify the blonde girl, but She was my age in the dream. My fiance is 23 years old.)

Interpretation
My fiance is away at school which may account for the foreign place. I may fear subconsciously, that he will be taken from me by another girl--symbolized by his death and my stolen potatoe chips, which in reality I like to eat. Perhaps I look on my mother as a bearer of bad news who adds one trouble to one already established.

This is only a snatch of a dream. I was walking down S--- Avenue at dusk when a colored man jumped out of a doorway and pulled me back into the shadows of a dime store's entrance. He began to molest me while I fought wildly and called to the passers-by for help. The people walking past were people I knew, but I cannot identify them. They looked at me as if nothing was happening, waved and smiled, and walked on.
Interpretation
In reality I probably miss the attentions of my fiance who is away at school and in order to stick to my principles I disguise any cravings in my dream in the form of an attack under very repulsive conditions. The people therefore seem to see me with my fiance and don't think anything is wrong. I have always disliked dime stores intensely since I worked in one a few times, and this setting also adds to my fear and distaste.

I dreamed I was in a Speech Class at M--- and the girl in front of me kept fidgeting & told the teacher not to call on her as she was too nervous. Next I was in a class which was electing some committees. I remember seeing the words, "Christmas" and "Easter" on the board, and I couldn't see any reason for having to hold the election. We all dropped what we were doing & went outside. There was a beach and a bunch of girls & fellows were either building something out in the water or else were trying to hold a picnic on a sand bar. I seemed to be on the committee for the gathering and was called to the phone. It was some boy's mother, & she kept talking continuously & seemed interested in Boy Scouts. Meanwhile everyone was busy carrying things to the sand bar. By the time I finished talking all the work was done, & I remember going out in a boat with a gang. It was dark and the waves were high. Somehow I found myself in a bedroom which in the dream was supposed to be my girlfriend's bedroom. It was quite cluttered up, particularly the top of the dresser, and I was disgusted with the condition of it. The wallpaper was of huge red rose design. (In reality the girlfriend, who is 20 years old, has an entirely differently decorated room--although she is rather careless with her belongings.)
Interpretation
Perhaps this dream is concerned with my classes, for the day before I had the dream, I had a speech class & was told I was to prepare a speech for the next meeting. I do not like to make speeches. In another class we elected class officers, and I felt like it was extremely unnecessary to do it in college. As to the rest of the dream I can see no significance unless perhaps I feel I am being held back from being in a group by someone represented by the woman talking to me on the phone.

I dreamed I was in a very small general store with my fiance. In came the brother of a fellow I used to go with before I met my fiance. The brother is about 14 years old now, but he seemed older in the dream. He showed me some money he had gotten on a trip. It was foreign money, and I felt it came from some island in the South Seas. The name on it was something like Madeira. This brother told me that P--- his brother was home now.
Interpretation

My fiance asked me if I minded going to the same restaurant again for dinner. I said it was all right with me. We went down a hilly business section of a small town and in the valley was the restaurant. It was called the "L--- F---" or something similar. On either side of the door were scenes from a desert showing cacti and Joshua trees. We went in & sat down temporarily at a table with some strange people. They weren't very congenial, and we didn't like sitting with them, so as soon as an empty table was available, we moved. While we were attempting to order, three older people pushed in on us and sat down at the table too. My fiancee had to sit on the edge of his seat for the woman piled her belongings, especially a big round purse, on his chair. The people were very friendly, but we wanted to eat alone and were quite upset. After eating, we went through a door and walked up an incline inside a building. I waited on the crest of the incline while my fiance went into another room. Soon he & a huge crowd of people swept out of the room. All were dressed as Hollanders and yet spoke Spanish. They were all happy and excited and eager to be on their way. My fiance spoke Spanish fluently with them, and I was perturbed because I could only speak a few words, although I understood them. They were going down to Mexico and were so happy. I remember trying to say in Spanish "I wish I could go." I kept saying "Quiero _______"--can't recall the second word. My fiance stood with me talking to them & I kept saying "Quiero _______."
Interpretation
I can't interpret the beginning of the dream, but perhaps the ending of it symbolizes the desire I have to travel. I spent some time at school in A--- & always have wished to return someday. My fiance & I both plan to go there together. We have both taken Spanish, but not enough to speak fluently.

I dreamed I was at a recording dance. It was either in a small room or barn. Not many people were there & I was just standing and watching as my fiance wasn't with me. I saw two fellows dancing who I recognized, but the girls with them were unknown. Both fellows went to high school with me and I knew them very well, although I have never gone out with either of them. The one is now engaged while the other is at A. I saw a M. girl dancing and although she's engaged, she was not with her fiance. I wished I could dance too and felt since the fellows were old frlends they could have asked me to be nice, but they didn't. I couldn't see how the girl was able to dance when I couldn't.
Interpretation
I miss not being able to go to dances and other activities since my fiance is away at school. This loneliness shows up in my dreams. Either that or the fact that I went to a tea dance as I had to be a hostess and perhaps feel guilty because I danced one dance with a strange fellow.

I was in a huge school gym which resembled the one I used for handcraft on a playground while directing this summer. I was wrapping packages and decorating them. Others who I cannot recognize were doing the same thing. We found a decoration for a package which we thought was wonderful and beautiful. It was simply pasting one narrow piece of tape (dark colored) in the middle of a wider piece of tape like this: This was a great idea in the dream. Someone who I was familiar with, but can't recall now, criticized my wrapping and I felt bad and angry too. I also remember placing a candle in each corner of a package for design like this:
I saw the words "Medicine inside--Handle with care" on boxes. It seemed to be concerned with the Pharmaceutical Co. my father works for as I talked with his boss. Everyone left except me and I kept wrapping. A colored girl came in to clean and then a colored man. I heard him say to the colored girl that he was going to pick all the pockets of the coats and the pocket books before the people returned to work. I was furious and tried to stop him, but he smiled and pushed me violently away. I forgot to say earlier that in order to wrap the packages we had to lick the tape. It tasted so bad and my mouth became sticky and dry, so that I could hardly swallow. It was awfully frightening and uncomfortable too.

Interpretation
The gym has been identified. I can't see the significance of the packages, although I had been at my fiance's for dinner and we ate by 4 candles. We mentioned the lovely design reflected on the ceiling. My fiance wanted more light to eat by, so we put on the electric lights. However he had eaten the night before with me at my house by 5 candles and said then that it was fine. We all commented on this. My fiance and I had used my parents' car during the day, and we had to park it unlocked. This worried me as it was loaded with some medicine, and I knew my Dad wouldn't like it if he knew, because of the chance of theft. Perhaps this accounts for the threat of theft by the colored man. As to the dry taste in my mouth, I can't interpret it. I have had this dream of a dry mouth which hinders swallowing and finally leads to a feeling of not being able to get my breath many times. It is always very vivid and frightening.

I dreamed I was in the upstairs of a double house visiting one of my girl friends. She is 20 yrs. old and I've known her about 10 years. The house was strange. I was afraid of some Indians out in the back yard who were after me for some reason. I was frightened, but solved the problem by having my father (who was evidentally with me) back the car out to the front, and I sneaked out the front door without being seen by the Indians. Next I found myself walking through a department store on the way to an offlce. I stopped and looked at clothes and talked to someone I knew, but can't remember now. I was all dressed up and seemed to be there for an interview for a job. I wore my fur coat, a square fur hat--which impressed me for it was so stylish; and also I wore a silk scarf which I remember. I sat in the office as if I was extremely confident. I talked to a young girl and an older woman sat to one side observing me and taking notes. I seemed to be on a higher social level than either in the office.
Interpretation
The evening I had the dream I had visited my girl friend with my parents. We stayed quite late, so I had to stay up even later when I got home to finish The Prairie by Cooper, which was due the next day: This book is about Indians and their wars and friendships with white settlers. I was worrled I wouldn't finish the book, but I did. Thus I got away from the Indians. My sister just started working with my girlfriend B. who told me how she was getting along. My sister has had 3 yrs. of college and is now in an office with girls who have had none--thus she feels rather superior to the job as a whole. I identified myself with my sister in my dream, for I'd like to be able to work to have money to buy some clothes, but I can't when I'm in school. The feeling of superiority is something I don't wish to have. My fur coat just came out of storage that afternoon, thus I have it on in the dream.

I dreamed I was driving a car. It seemed I was sitting up high and close to the steering wheel. At times the car had only two wheels and other times it resembled a bike. I was driving very fast and confidently. I don't remember who was with me, but I was not alone. It seems I was driving around the block in front of my fiance's house and also in front of my girlfriend's house. My fiance is 23 and the girl is 20.

I dreamed I was sitting on the front porch of our cottage. It was dreary and rainy outside. I saw my Aunt sitting on a swing which hung from the ceiling (We do not have any such swing). She had a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on which fitted down over her nose in a peculiar muzzle-like way. I remember particularly a piece of the contraption fitted down the nose, following an indentation between the nostrils, like this. In a wicker stand were some plants which we were admiring. All at once the plants heaved upward, and a pig emerged oinking loudly. We all laughed and thought the pig was darling. We became very attached to the animal.

My Aunt has a slight dimple in her nose, but nothing compared to the one in the dream. I can't figure out why she would be wearing such glasses or what it would symbolize. The first pair of glasses I had were gold rimmed & I have always disliked having to wear glasses. I seemed to grow to like the pig as I liked our dog which died about 2 years ago. We had the dog for 12 years and he always loved our cottage. We buried him out at the cottage & perhaps the emergence of the pig from the flower box is symbolic of our dog's grave.

I dreamed I had helped my mother rearrange the living room. She had company in and when we all went into the living room I saw that she had put the furniture back in its original position. I was absolutely furious & hurt to think that I had spent my whole day rearranging the room only to find that Mother had switched the furniture around when my back was turned. I told her just what I thought of this in front of the company. I was very frank and brazen about it.
Interpretation
In reality I had spent the Saturday helping my mother change the furniture in the living room when I really should have been doing homework. I knew she wouldn't have liked it if I hadn't helped her--homework or no homework!

I dreamed I was with a strange fellow climbing up steep steps to get to a seat in a theater. I saw two friends of my mother's. These women (about 50 yrs. old) were made up quite extremely & I felt a great distaste for them. For some reason or other the curtain was half up. I could see an actor In a red room climb into a coffin. Although I realized it was only a stage setting, I felt frightened & turned to my companion for assurance. We left almost at once as if the play were over. We walked down many, many stairs which were covered all the way down with an awning of green stripes. When we got outside we could look back & see the different landings of the steps covered with one huge awning. Each landing led to an exclusive night club. There were about 5 neon signs.
Interpretation
I seemed to be very attracted to the strange fellow altho I realized I was engaged to someone else. This would seem to indicate I'm not happy about my engagement which I can't seem to fit at all. Perhaps this stranger was merely a substitution for my fiance. We had been to the Pu-- A--- several nights previously & had to climb steep steps. We saw "Desert Song" in which the hero wore red. At the entrance of the A--- was a green & white awning for it was snowing badly. My fiance & I haven't been to a night club for quite a while because he is away at school & when he comes home we have other things more important to do. Besides it is expensive. Perhaps I have a wish to go, if so it isn't conscious.

I dreamed I was upstairs in H--- Hall making a phone call to a girlfriend. (She is 20) At times I seemed to be in a bedroom & at other times the hall was being used as a dining hall. There was a large, long table at which many M--- girls were sitting. I kept talking on the phone & the girls at the table kept calling for me to come eat. Then the scene was again changed to a bedroom & I was still on the phone. All at once some girl came bounding through my room on her hands & feet, like an ape. I thought she was just kidding & then another girl stuck her head in the door & and said "Did you see her?" I told her I had & asked if she were just being silly. She said, "No, she's always like that!"
Interpretation
The setting was H--- Hall because I've spent so much time there practicing for S--- Night. It also accounts for the large group of girls. The girl I was calling lives at H--- so I can't understand why I was calling her at some other place. I had tried to call her one night this week from my home & she was out. Perhaps the ape-like antics is a reflection of the S--- Night antics we've been practicing so diligently.

I dreamed I had a girl over for dinner. The girl is 20 & I know her fairly well as she is in my class. After dinner, I told her I hoped she enjoyed being at my house to eat. She said the food was fine, but that she had not had enough water. She said my father "hogged" the water pitcher & drank so much that when she wanted some it was all gone. She enumerated other things which weren't done the way her family does them. I can't remember what they were but I felt pretty bad about it.
Interpretation
I can't understand this at all. The girl has never been to my house. She needs a flashlight for a stunt she's in & I told her I would lone her my father's when I saw her this afternoon. My father always has to have water at his meals. My entire family likes water with the meal, though, so I can't seem to interpret this part of the dream.

I dreamed I was in H--- Hall where I met my Aunt, and also a girlfriend (20 yrs) who lives there. I was quite surprised to see my aunt and wanted to show her around. I introduced her to a fellow who played football. He began talking with her, so I went away. I don't know where, but I met and talked with many school friends. When I returned to my aunt she was still talking to the football player. I was amazed to find her so interested in the fellow as he was not the polished, refined typed which she approves of.
Interpretation
I believe this dream was caused by the anticipation of returning to school after vacation. Therefore I was meeting many school mates and was in H. Why my aunt should be there too, I don't know.

I dreamed I was working in a department store with people I had gone to high school with. During my lunch hour I went to a library with my girlfriend (21 yrs.) to get a book out. I had to walk uphill. In the library I found a book which I needed for a class at some school. It was a reference book so I hunted for another copy. The book seemed to be about King Arthur, but it was only to be found in the F. room. Along with the books were also pots and pans on the shelves. After working we waited on the corner for the bus. I saw among the group two fellows who I knew very well and were good friends in high school. They admired my engagement ring.
Interpretation
I imagine that returning to school reminded me of my high school days. The idea that I was working probably arises from the fact that I'm anxious to finish school and work for a change. Perhaps the pots and pans symbolize marriage for I also plan to marry after graduation. I have been getting things together that I will need for keeping house.

I had been waiting a long time for some duck eggs to hatch. There were 13. I didn't count them but I knew there were 13. As I watched, twelve of the eggs began to crack open and pieces of the shells were scattered all over. Then, just as the tops of the little ducks' heads appeared, all activity stopped and I knew they were all dead.
I took one egg that was left and moved it to the side of the nest away from the others. Then it cracked open and a little duck emerged. I picked it up in my hand and put it in a bucket of water to teach it to swim.

I was attending a tea party with eight other women (all aged between 40 and 60). They were teachers from the school where I teach. The principal was also there (F-40). She was very angry with all of us teachers because we had gone to the party and left our classes alone in the rooms. But we just let her fume and we went on having a good time.
Then, later, I wss walking back to my classroom and I stopped to read a notice on the bulletin board. It read, "Room 109, (my room) 1st grade, may use the gym at 4:08 each day."

Interpretation
I think both parts are wish-fulfillment. The first part is a desire to openly defy the principal. She is a fussy, finicky woman and I often feel like "telling her off" but I never have.

The next part is a wish to teach 1st grade next fall. It is the grade I like best, but I have recently been teaching the 3rd grade.

I kept hoping that something would happen so that I wouldn't have to marry him. But nothing did, and the day of the wedding finally arrived. I was frantic because no arrangements had been made.

I was walking along a path which ran beside a broad, calm river. Then the path turned away fromthe river and ran through a thick forest. The forest began to grow thicker and darker. I was frightened, but something compelled me to walk on. Suddenly, I was out of the woods and standing at the edge of a large open space. In the middle of this clearing I saw a beautiful house. It was a large, white house with blue awnings at the windows, and three white pillars at the front. Hundreds of yellow roses were climbing around the pillars. It was a lovely scene, but it was very frightening. I wanted to go back, but something seemed to draw me toward the house. Then, as I came close to it, the whole house began to tremble and collapse. I turned and began to run toward the forest. Before I reached it, I awoke. Even after I awoke, it took a long time to get rid of the feeling of terror.

I was walking along the top of a mountain when suddenly a chasm opened before me. It happened so quickly that I couldn't stop. I started to fall, but the chasm wasn't very wide and I managed to stop my fall by bracing my feet against one wall and my shoulders against the other. Then I looked down, and it seemed as though I could see down for at least a mile. At the bottom were a lot of tiny houses. I was terribly frightened, because I was growing tired and I knew I would soon fall. I woke up then, but every time I closed my eyes I could see that long drop. I finally had to get a book and read a while before I could go back to sleep.

I was going somewhere on a streetcar. After I had been riding a while, a Negro friend of mine (M-25) got on the car and sat down beside me. We were talking about a class we had taken together. Then a tall, fat white man--a stranger about 50--came over and pointed a gun at my friend and forced him to get off the streetcar. The white man said it made him sick to see a negro talking to a white person. Then, as my friend was walking across the street, the man shot him in the back.

This dream took place in a small room - I don't know where - in which the O.W. Choir (of which I am a member) was congregated. We were rehearsing some popular pieces when a large group of women entered the room. As I remember, almost all of them seemed to be wearing furs. I kept getting up to offer my seat to them, but no one accepted it. The conductor changed the song immediately and we began to sing classical numbers. The women sat along a window sill, and I seemed to keep moving from chair to chair. The director then measured the length of our robes to see that they were three inches from the floor.
Interpretation
It seems that there must have been more to this dream, but I cannot recall anything further. The only connection which I can make is that I had recently thought of my choir director at school, as there is a high school music clinic going on there now. The idea of measuring our robes seems to revert back to high school, as our director insisted upon our robes being three inches from the floor. I find no connection to the women, or the idea of offering my seat.

I dreamed that I was sitting at a counter at the A. V. It was about 1:30 and I was to meet my mother downtown at 3:30. I was very hungry, but no one would wait on me. Then a sailor sat down beside me and put his arm around me. He seemed to be half asleep. I was very insulted, and immediately walked out. I then discovered I had a book of his which merely said "scrapbook" on the front. I decided to return it, but couldn't find him. I then saw a parade of sailors coming down the street. I wrote my name and address inside the book, and said I was sorry I had been so rude to him. I ran up beside one of the sailors (who was a girl) and asked if she could return it. She said she could locate him by the number on the book (which I had not noticed previously).
Interpretation
I can find no connection with the A. V.! I had previously visited a girlfriend who is engaged to a sailor, although I hadn't thought of him at all. The scrapbook might have been connected with the fact that I had left my notebook in class that day, and later found it. I find no meaning to the parade, meeting my mother, or the female sailor!

I dreamed that my home was a huge mansion, composed of five floors. My room was on the third floor, and was very small. I remember seeing that everything in it was pink, and it seemed to be long and very narrow. In the dream I found that my sister had a room on the fourth floor which was very huge and done up completely in green. I walked from room to room on the fourth floor, and found that many of my old friends were living in them. Who these friends were is a bit hazy now, but they were people I knew a long time ago. I was very jealous of my sister's room, and I thought it was horribly unfair of my mother not to let me have the room. I thought she should let us alternate using the room. This much is all I can remember.
Interpretation
I might interpret this dream by a feeling of jealousy towards my sister, but I have never felt this way. The only explanation I can find is that I sometimes say to my folks, "You let Marge do it when she was my age," in order to do something my folks dislike. Maybe this dream was my punishment! However, I definitely have no feelings of jealousy toward my sister. My room at present is done in pink, and my sister's room many years ago was in green. Why I dreamed of this or a mansion I don't know.

At the beginning of this dream it took place in a hotel lobby. A friend of mine was standing at a desk, and presently she came over to me with something hidden inside her coat. It turned out to be chocolate, eggs, sugar, and all the ingredients necessary to make fudge. We ran upstairs with these things hidden. The building then seemed to be built like A Hall, and it seemed that we climbed about six flights of stairs. On the top floor we found there was a radio broadcast going on, so we had to sneak down again. There seemed to be about fifteen girls mingling around who eventually began to chase us. This is all I recall, except that at the end the ingredients were combined and we were running with a pan of fudge.
Interpretation
I often have a desire to make fudge around home, especially when home alone, I usually don't tell my folks when I make it, and perhaps that accounts for my trying to hide it in the dream. My first class at Reserve is in A. on the third floor, and perhaps this accounts for the climbing of stairs. As for the radio broadcast and the group of girls, I can't quite figure that out.

This dream seemed to be especially long, and especially realistic. After I awoke I realized how absurd it really was. It began on a boat where someone had been murdered (a male). The murderer had wrapped a snake around the victim's neck. I was suspicious of a tall, dark, young man, who was not good looking but had a beautiful build. As I recall, his name was Wade. However, after I got to know him we fell very much in love, and combined our efforts to find the murderer. The next thing I recall is that we were walking down a road to a farmhouse. Someone there told us to follow a road to find the murderer. We walked down the road, and soon Wade was far ahead of me. The road divided and it seemed to be very misty. I couldn't find Wade. There were millions of people walking down the road and I passed a young fellow who had been on the boat. I asked him about Wade and he said he had just been killed. I came to a hurst with two policemen in it. There were curtains drawn all the way around it, and the policeman peeked through and said Wade was dead. I cried through the rest of the dream! I then came to in an airplane filled with tunnels and people. I overheard the pilot telling the murderer he would conceal the murderer in the wing. I then realized the murderer was the young man who had told me Wade was killed. My father then advised and I told him where the murderer was. This is the last I recall.
Interpretation
The only connection I can make to this dream is my worry about my boyfriend being short! (about my height) The prevalent thing in the dream was that Wade was tall. When I awoke I felt as though I had been crying all night. It took a long time to get this dream out of my mind. No one in the dream was familiar to me, except my father. I had never seen Wade before. The murderer wore a plaid sweater and was a good friend. I told my father who he was because I felt revengeful about Wade's death. I can't connect the airplane or boat or any of the people.

This dream was a very disconnected one. It began when I was riding in a car with my girlfriend's boyfriend. The two of them had had a fight. It seems that we drove for hours and hours. Later I got out of the car and started walking. A middle aged man picked me up and put my suitcase in the back of the car(!!) He kept giving me sly looks and I realized he was going to kidnap me. Five young men came down the street and walked straight towards me. I said, "Don't you dare take another step!" and they stopped. The next thing I knew I was in A------. I was walking with someone who was saying something to the Eskimos. It seemed that he was saying "oogie woogie" or some similar phrase such as that! I remember it was very cold and there was a sharp wind. I remember seeing a great deal of snow.
Interpretation
One connection I can make with this dream is that I had been driving quite a bit the day I had this dream. Possibly the idea of my being in A------ is also connected, as one of my girlfriend's fiancee is stationed there. Also, the girlfriend's boyfriend who was in the dream had really had a fight with his girl the day before. I can't explain the idea of being kidnapped or the five young men!

This was rather a disconnected dream, and I'm sure there was more to it than I can remember. However, it took place in a rather barren room, which was evidently my living quarters. I had captured a tiger (!) and kept it stuffed in a large chest. The tiger knew something which I wanted to know, so I told him I would free him if he would tell me. The tiger had the face of a man, and stood on his hind legs. The last I remember, we were in a telephone booth together making an important phone call.
Interpretation
I can't think of any connection to this dream. I hadn't seen any Frank Buck movies, or given any thought to tigers! The tiger's face looked like that of a boy in my Psychology of Adolescence class This boy is always interrupting in class and monopolizing most of the class period.

I was riding in a car with my boyfriend at D-------, O----. It was a Sunday afternoon and there were many 0--- W------ students walking around. We were going on a picnic and I was riding in the backseat while my boyfriend drove. We came to a steep hill which we couldn't get up. This hill suddenly changed to the hill at C --- P--- Theater, and fire engines were chasing each other up and down it! I felt as though I was still at D-------, and I was fearful that the dorm was on fire.
Interpretation
A few days before this dream I had heard several fire engines, and was tempted to find the fire. I hadn't been thinking about D----- my boyfriend, or a picnic. Perhaps my worry about the dorm burning up was caused by the fact that the dorm I lived in, is an old fire trap, and we were constantly having fire drills.

Answers to questions
2. I felt anxiety and frustration at not being able to get up the hill - also I felt excitement over the fire engines.
3. An actual participant
4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant.
5. A steep hill in a park.

This dream took place in an apartment which was supposedly my home, and was located on Cedar, near the top of Cc--- Hill. The building resembled an apartment, but the bottom floor was a huge mansion in which I lived. I saw two girls I knew, both named Virginia, and was talking to them through the window. I suddenly realized that I had missed a girlfriend's wedding, in which I was supposed to be a bridesmaid. The wedding took place at 9:45. I ran downstairs, and suddenly our basement was composed of many long tunnels with wooden posts, cobwebs, and insects. It resembled a mine and had many rooms off of it. I was with my freshman year roommate at college, and we were being pursued by an invisible worn! My roommate said something which angered the worm, and the next thing I knew she was being cut by a razor blade! I recall seeing scratches on her face and blood coming from there.
Interpretation
Perhaps this dream illustrates my aggressive tendencies! found myself frantically running from something, although I don't know what it would have been in real life. The house or basement was nothing which I had ever seen before. I had been looking through my Heights yearbook recently, and remember seeing the pictures of the two Virginias in my dream. Why I should dream of an invisible worm with a razor, I do not know, unless it is a phallic symbol.

In this dream my father was going to take a group of us for an airplane ride, including my sister (23), my mother (52), a girlfriend of my sister's (23), and myself. Much of my dream seemed to be composed of an argument I was having with my mother. She wouldn't allow me to go in the plane, and it seemed to have something to do with the kind of shoes I had on! She told me that if I went I would be killed. I remember feeling that I was being persecuted, and my sister was allowed to go while I wasn't.
Suddenly the scene changed and I was at college at M. University. I was walking on the fourth floor of a dormitory, and the floor was broken up into big pieces which were revolving. Someone came up to me and asked me who turned on the switch to have the floors revolve. This was connected with the airplane ride, as someone said that the reason the floor was revolving was because there was an airplane someplace near by.

Interpretation
The dream seems to indicate a feeling of my sister's preference in the family. The friend of my sister's was a girl who I have not seen or thought of for years. The dominance of my mother in the dream relates to reality, for she is always the disciplining factor in the family. The revolving floors might show a feeling of insecurity or fear of rejection.

I dreamed I was entered in a song-naming contest. The first song I recognized immediately, and claimed my prize (money). Suddenly a woman loomed forward and insisted I had cheated. I recall crying bitterly.
Interpretation

I dreamed I was at a party, composed of a mixed crowd of adults. Each person had some sort of an animal with him, and these animals were entered in a contest. They were to burrough in the ground and the first to reach the goal was the winner. I then suddenly found myself completely alone.
Interpretation
The presence of adults might indicate my desire to be treated as an adult and be free of dependency. The contest might be my struggle for recognition, and at the same time my fear of rejection and conflict about becoming independent would be indicated by being left alone.

I had a job in some sort of plant (factory) and I worked at a machine which resembled a cream separator used on small farms. I cannot recall the operation of this machine at all. The only incident I recall is that I was angry and in this anger the only way of release that I seemed to have was to squash slices of ripe tomatoes over the parts of the machine which stuck out. This act seemed to be a retalitory act.
Interpretation
I do not have a definite interpretation of this dream. I can associate the tomatoes with the fact that I have always enjoyed eating raw tomatoes but why they would appear in an unpleasant dream is not clear to me. The presence of the machine seems to indicate the steady rigid pace of social custom, and since I had been forced to leave a party sooner than I had wanted to just recently; this dream might indicate that I found release for this frustration by being angry at the machine.

2. I seemed to be angry and frustrated at the same time.

College women, late 1940s:#0418 (Code 059, Age 23, 10/06/47)

Setting- our pond at home, it was late fall, the trees were all bare and it was cold outdoors.
Characters -five men who were strangers. I was not able to distinguish them as to age but they appeared to be dressed as business men.

Action - A glider plane landed on the water close to the dam. The landing seemed to be smooth but actually it was a forced landing. I recall seeing the ship sink slowly in the water but recall no action until I saw the five bodies, in miniature size, lying together in the bottom of an ordinary pail. I did not question the fact the bodies had suddenly became so small and know of no reason for it. I was alone watching this action from a distance but later when I saw the bodies' our St. Bernard dog was with me. I experienced no dread, only surprised wonder and sadness.

Interpretation
I enjoy flying a great deal and for this reason the appearance of a plane is not novel to me. I must have gotten my ships a little mixed up though, for while the action of a ship landing on our pond is not new, since it occurred last year in the late fall, the ship was a heliocopter, equipped for amphibious landings. I was not at home when this occurred and was very disappointed about it, so it would seem that even though I was unable to place myself in the dream as a passenger at least I had the satisfaction of being able to see it. However, the feeling of sadness which I experienced upon the realization that people had been drowned in our pond is directly related to by conscious feeling of fear that someone, some day, may drown in our pond, for at its deepest end it is approximately 15 feet deep. The presence of strangers is most likely a manifestation of the new groups of people I have met here at W.R.U. The presence of the pail and the dog only served to make the dream more closely related to my past experiences.

2. Surprised and sad.

College women, late 1940s:#0419 (Code 059, Age 23, 10/11/47)

Setting - a restaurant on the campus of the college I was attending.
Characters -my father and brother, 2 student waiters, several old women and an average restaurant crowd.

Action - I had planned on meeting my father and brother (who is in the Navy now but was a civilian here) at this restaurant. I spent a good deal of time looking for them among the crowd but finally found them. Then we sat down to eat but had to wait a long time until a waiter promised to take our order. I recall that there were two student waiters who were very busy taking care of serving several older women. Sometime during the action, I recall bumping into the waiters and having to excuse myself. I recall no other action but I do remember experiencing frustration when I was unable to find my dad and brother and even greater frustration when we were unable to get the waiter to take our order.

Interpretation
I interpret this dream as a manifestation of my desire to have my brother at home again and in a more broad sense my desire but my seemingly impossible hope of making my father look with less cynicism and distrust at the general topic -college. In this dream I seemed to have failed in that endeavor again although I recall nothing of my father's reaction. The entire situation was not a favorable one for my point of view. The presence of men student waiters is most likely an unconscious association with a student who I have met here who waits on tables. The appearance of older women probably suggest a part of the faculty, although I have had no reason for feeling a dislike toward them.

I dreamt that I was to attend a Spanish class at 7:30 at night. I had to go to my room in the dormitory to get my books. I remember taking an escalator to the 2nd floor and meeting a girl on the escalator. I told her to wait for me. When I got to the 2nd floor, I opened the door to my room and discovered it was a classroom. I was very confused. I tried some of the other doors on the floor, but they were all locked. I decided to take an elevator down to the first floor, but here the dream gets rather confused. I seemed to be swinging through hoops. I remember thinking it was like some ride at E. Beach.
Interpretation
This dream took place shortly before school started, which explains its content. The reference to 7:30 is easily explained as I intended getting up the next day at that hour to attend an activities program for new students. My mayor is Spanish. I had been a little worried about how well I'd do this semester, because I'm transferring from 0. During my two years stay there I lived in a dormitory. I had been wondering how I would like living at home again after having had two extremely pleasant years of dormitory life. I cannot account for the balance of the dream.

I dreamt that my 19 year old brother and I had just left our house and were walking down our street. From a distance we saw two people (don't recall sex) on the corner. They seemed to be looking for someone to antagonize. It did not occur to me that we would be the unfortunate ones. When they saw us they began to throw sticks and stones at us. We turned back and started running down the street. We crossed the street and went through an open gate in a backyard (unfamiliar to me except that I seem to have seen this gate and yard before in my dreams.)
We ran on for what seemed close to an half hour. Then we reached a side street and stopped--assuring ourselves that we were no longer being pursued. The street seemed to be in the neighborhood of S C Ave., which is about 20 blocks from my home. I asked my brother if he wanted to take a cab home and then before he had replied, continued that I thought we would be safe on a streetcar. At that moment my parents came into view. They had both very obviously been drinking and were tottering on their feet and grinning stupidly. My mother said that she had had ten drinks. Our car was parked on the side street and we decided to go home. We got into the car and just before we left a policeman came up and gave us a ticket for parking in front of a fireplug. We drove up to 1 st. and started down when I realized all of a sudden that we were in the midst of a parade. All the paraders were colored people. They began shouting that we could not ride in their parade.

Interpretation
I believe the reason my brother entered the dream is that he has been overseas for 1 1/2 years and I have been anxiously looking forward to his return this fall. I had this dream two days after I saw the movie "G." Being of the J faith it naturally made a deep impression on me. Although I had never experienced any real difficulties because of my religious views, the picture brought out to me the many humiliating experiences which others of my faith have undergone. The whole issue of anti-semitism in the movie began with the invitation of Mr. S (a J) to his apartment of some soldier's saying: "What is the matter? D'ya think we're not good enough to drink your stinking liquor?" The number ten may have arisen from the boasting of one of my young friends on the Saturday before my dream that he had consumed 10 bottles of beer at a picnic. The amount he had consumed greatly astounded me at the time. I cannot explain the fact that both my parents were drunk, as both drink very little. The difficulty we experienced with the policeman may have been due to the parking difficulties we have had of late. With reference to the parade of colored people, their place in my dream is probably due to the fact that we live in an almost entirely colored neighborhood and have been attempting unsuccessfully to find another house into which to move.

College women, late 1940s:#0437 (Code 064, Age 21, 09/30/47)

In my dream I am in a two-room doctor's office. The doctor's sex seems to fluctuate between male and female. There are two other patients in the office. One of the patients is my cousin (a girl of 23), the other a middle-aged woman unknown to me, accompanied by her two children. The doctor examines the middle-aged woman and tells her bluntly she has cancer of the pancreas. He then examines my cousin and tells her she has cancer of the breast. My cousin burst out crying and ran into the next office. The rooms of the office are doorless. The doctor examines me and makes no comment. I go to the next room and see my cousin. She is holding a ring box and crying. A woman is combing her hair and comforting her. The middle-aged woman offers to drive the doctor (now a woman) home. The doctor asks the woman if she will also drive me home and she hesitatingly answers in the affirmative. It seems that she and I live in the same neighborhood. She drops us off at the corner of my street.
Interpretation
The doorless two-room office, I believe, may have been brought to my mind by the voting booths. I had noted for the first time that day and it left a deep impression on my mind. There has been a great deal of publicity of late with regard to Cancer Clinics, and I think the middle-aged woman in my dream symbolizes my aunt, who died of cancer two years ago. She, also, had two children. By cousin's presence may be accounted for by the fact that I am to be a bridesmaid at her wedding next month and have been very excited at the prospect. The ring box symbolizes her approaching wedding as does, I believe, the combing of her hair as if getting ready for the wedding. The voting booth was on the corner and I believe this fact corresponds to the last phase of my dream. The doctor, now, may be identified with my girlfriend--with whom I went to vote.

I am in a two-room office. It seems to be in the M. A. building. There are two women in the office. I recognize both of them as being co-workers of mine when I worked for the MMC three years ago. Another woman (just a blurred image) is dictating to one of the girls. She seems to be worried because the mail had not yet arrived. I go down to the basement of the building and look in my box. "I find two notes. The top seems to be located in M A, but is on the wrong side of the hall. The notes seem to deal with some papers which I forgot to turn in at the bookstore. I am extremely puzzled. "How could I have known about those papers when I am not a Mstudent, " I say to myself. As I am standing by the box I see my cousin (a married man of 29) put a note in his sister's box. (She is 31 and does not go to M.) I then go to the bookstore which is also in the basement. I am told it is the wrong one. I go upstairs, still in search of the bookstore and meet my S prof (the one I had at OSU.) I seem now to be at 0. S. U. He asks me why I returned and I explain that I am no longer going steady. At this point my dress blows up and I have difficulty holding it down. Ask him to help. We admit that teachers seem to get along better with pupils in class than out. I walk away.
Interpretation
The two-room office here represents my advisor's office. I had been in to see her the previous day. The women from W. M. C. were probably brought to my mind because I saw one of them downtown recently and it had been a long time since I saw anyone from the office. The note I found in my box corresponds to the one I received from my advisor. She had advised me that through error, I had been placed in a class for which juniors were not eligible. She said she had not known about it (which corresponds to my statement that I could not have known about the papers.) My cousin probably entered my dream due to the fact that I was worried about him. I had heard that day that he was having marital difficulties and that his family (represented by his sister) were very perturbed. I cannot account for the presence of my S Prof. in my dream, nor why I should again be at OSU. The episode of the dress is equally unaccounted in my mind. My statement that I am no longer going steady is true. It probably explains my return to 0. S. U.--escape from unpleasant situation here.

I am seated in a classroom. It is a course in Beginning German. Our teacher is a woman (face unfamiliar). It is the first day of class. The teacher is speaking to us in German. (I don't understand her.) All of a sudden we see a man running past the window. He is carrying books. The teacher attempts to attract his attention, but fails. He comes into the classroom a few minutes later, wearing a shirt. I seem to recall that he wore a baby's bonnet on his head. He takes these clothes off or, at any rate, I later recall him as wearing a business suit. His features are very clear (face unfamiliar to me). I particularly notice that his teeth are not nice. He and the German prof. discuss the possibility of opening up another German class. The teacher again talks to us in German. The words are very long. I do not understand her. The young man leaves and says goodbye to us all. (Forgot to mention that I laughed almost hysterically when he came into the room. I remember the tears rolled down my cheeks.) In the second part of my dream, I seem to be near a football field. I am looking for my boyfriend, but cannot find him. The scene changes to the lounge of the dormitory at O. S. U. I am sitting on a striped-chintz love seat. My housemother comes into the room (aged 60). At the same time I see a girlfriend of mine being helped into a car. Someone says she is being taken to the Dean's office. My housemother approaches and asks me for my notebooks. She says the Dean is looking through all girls' notebooks to see if they have loud sentences written in them. I give her all but my psychology notebook which I fear may have some obscene words in it. I look through it, but find nothing. I see my boyfriend (age 20) and tell him what happened. He tells me he thinks they were wrong for doing it. The third phase of my dream took place in my living room. My boyfriend and I are seated on the couch. He attempts to kiss me, but I feign indifference. He calls my bluff and we kiss.
Interpretation
The episode in the German class can probably be explained by the fact that my boyfriend is taking German and experiencing difficulty with it. I remember telling him that I wish I knew German so that I could help him. I attempted to test him on a vocabulary list and we both laughed heartily over my pronunciation. The unusual costume of the head of the German Department brings to my mind the costumes sported by freshmen women the first week of school. The second phase of my dream would seem to represent my guilt feelings concerning sex. Of late I have noticed that my mind is frequently preoccupied with the subject of "sex" I have felt that my preoccupations were unhealthy. The episode of the psychology notebook escapes me. The third phase probably represents just plain wishful thinking. I hadn't kissed my boyfriend in a few days and was looking forward to it. I probably feign indifference to get back at him for not having kissed me.

I'm in a hotel room with one of my girlfriends (age 21). I see a tall, blond woman wearing a gold evening gown. Her gown catches on fire. My girlfriend and I hasten toward an open window and jump out. The room we had been in was devoid of furniture. (Not too sure of last statement.) We quickly run around to the front entrance. We go into a large room. I see a handful of people sitting on what appear to be shoe-shine chairs. Their heads are all bent down and they appear to be very sad. I recognize my father. I seem to recall that some of the others were also members of my family, but I couldn't remember specifically who they were. Someone tells me that some of the members of my family are missing.
Interpretation
This dream has little meaning for me. The only connection I can make with the hotel room is that my boyfriend and I have a standing joke about making a reservation at the S-- hotel, "just to sleep together nothing else." The girl in my dream used to go steady with my boyfriend, but is now married. It was she who introduced us. Perhaps this dream symbolizes the family disapproval with which our indiscretion would be met. Yet, this interpretation seems hard to accept, as we have never seriously considered transgressing. I suppose I must confess to being extremely curious of "what it would be like." Maybe the dream represents a conflict between my unconscious desire to have intercourse and a strict superego.

In my dream someone tells me that my brother, age 19, is on his way home and is planning to drop in on us unexpectedly. My mother, age 47, sister, age 19, and I decide to surprise him and be at the station to meet him. When we arrive, we see my brother and his boyfriend, age 19, also enlisted in the U. S. Army. They seem to see us, but pass right by. My brother then turns around, takes out a flashbulb camera and takes our picture. I then remember my mother embracing my brother and crying. I run up to my brother, hug him and with tears welling up into my eyes keep repeating that I am so glad he has finally come home. J remember that as I was hugging him, a little voice within me kept saying: "See, you didn't have to worry about how you'd act when you saw ____._."
Interpretation
My brother had called from S--, W-- Saturday night. He talked to my mother and dad but not to me, as I was not home. I was very excited about his call, and remember saying that I was glad in a way, that I had not been home as I wouldn't have known what to say to him. His boyfriend also called his mother that night to say that he would be home soon. The flashbulb camera brings to mind the fact that my sister asked me to take her flashbulb pictures to the photography shop the next day to be developed. The fact that my brother was planning to drop in on us unexpectedly may be explained by the fact that those were the plans he actually had.

I find myself in a small kitchen. It seems to be on the second floor. My cousin, girl age 19, is with me. We decide to go for a walk. As we are walking we pass a large field. A wedding seems about to take place. I see the bride, also a cousin, age 24, dressed in a bridal gown. One of my aunts (can't remember who) came up to us and asks us why we aren't ready. We assure her that we will hasten home and get ready. On the way home we pass a fruit store. My mother and dad are just coming out the door. I angrily yell at my mother for not having reminded me to get ready. We approach the house which appears to be an apt. bldg with an unusual number of steps leading up to the door. As we are ready to ascend the steps we are accosted by 2 boys. I ignore the one who attempts to speak to me, noticing that he has little hair on the top of his head. I say to myself that he has no more hair than my boyfriend. We go up to the apartment. The next scene is in a church. I am standing in front of a mirror. I look at my bridesmaid gown and discover it is extremely large in the waist. When I look again it has changed to a house dress. I remember feeling very relieved and reassuring myself that it wasn't the gown but the housedress that was too large. I ask someone (don't remember who) if there is a washroom somewhere. I enter a doorway and see a number of men milling around. I remember saying: Heads up.
Interpretation
The apartment is entirely unfamiliar to me. My cousin age 17, is to be a bridesmaid at my other cousin's age 24 wedding. This is the second dream I've had about her wedding. I explain it as due to my excitement at being a bridesmaid for the first time. My gown was being altered and I greatly feared that it wouldn't fit upon its completion. This probably accounts for the fact that it was too large in my dream. The housedress episode seems to symbolize my refusal to believe that the dress would be too large. The episode of the washroom escapes me, although I have had another dream in which a washroom played a part and also in which men were present.

It is toward evening. I am getting into a station wagon. My sister, age 18, also gets in. There are 2 or 3 other people in the car but I do not recall their sex or identity. I seem to be riding in the back seat, yet later I am in the front seat. There is also a dog riding with us in the front seat. The locale in which we are riding is unfamiliar to me. After we have ridden awhile my sister and I express desire to use the women's washroom. We stop in front of a building which resembles somewhat H. Chapel. We alight and go in. We find the women's washroom. It is an immense room which resembles none I've seen. There are many little cubby holes which I presume to contain toilets. However I did not see any. Each cubby hole was covered in front with a white curtain. However the backs were left completely open. I looked through the back entrance of the cubby hole and saw a long bench on which a group of men were sitting. I looked and looked but could find no cubby hole whose back entrance was also covered. I woke up. It was about 3-4 in the morning. I felt an extreme urge to urinate.
Interpretation
I cannot interpret this dream. I have never ridden in a station wagon nor expressed a desire to do so. We have no dog at home. Perhaps the dog was brought to my mind by the fact that everyday on my way home I pass a pet shop. In each window there are about 1/2 dozen puppies. I always stop to look at them, assuring myself at the same time that as cute as they are, I wouldn't want to be bothered with them.

In my dream I see my recently married cousin, girl age 24, walking down my street supported by two other girls. I recognize one as being another one of my cousins. They are walking very slowly and approach our house. My mother and I are standing on the porch. We greet them. I ask my cousin how she is feeling and she responds that she feels well. I remember thinking to myself that I was so glad she was well and that now perhaps she would be able to keep her baby. All thou leave soon thereafter and they continue to walk very slowly down the street. All of a sudden she (the one who is to have a baby) appears to be suspended in air with her toes pointing toward the ground. I remember thinking: well, if she can do that she is all right.
Interpretation
At a family tea held Friday night I inquired if the cousin mentioned in my dream were going to be there. By mother informed me that my cousin was pregnant but she was laid up in bed and it was greatly feared that she would lose her baby. I seem to be reassuring myself that everything would finally resolve itself.

I am walking down a street which I recognize as being near PHJH. A man, a woman, and a baby in a carriage approach me. I can see the man and woman's features very clearly. They are both unfamiliar to me. The man lifts the buggy in the air. He seems to be trying to get it over a puddle. I stretch out my arms and help him. I look into the buggy and wrinkle up my nose at the baby. The next scene takes place in an apartment. The same 3 people are present. The young mother attempts to give the baby a bottle. The milk is too hot. She tries to give him the bottle again; it is still too hot. She finally gives it to the baby and he refuses it because it is too cold. The man throughout this procedure appears to be hostile toward his wife. In the next scene I pass a mother (same woman) and a little boy on the corner of a busy intersection (unfamiliar). The boy is now about 4-5 years old. I can see his features very clearly, yet he, too, is unfamiliar to me. I again wrinkle up my nose at him and remember that I had done the same thing when he was an infant. I turn the corner and walk down a street. I past a store and look into the store window. I see my image. I notice that I appear just as young, but am slightly heaver in weight.
Interpretation
I have been contemplating marriage with a student of the University and have spent quite a bit of thought on the fact that I would not be able to have children for perhaps 4-5 yrs. I believe this child symbolizes the child I would not be able to have. That is why I believe, when he appears to be 4-5 yrs. old, I still look the same. I would analyze the man's hostility toward his wife thus: It has often said that a wife neglects her husband upon the birth of a child and I am determined to divide my love upon the birth of my child in order that my husband should not be deprived of any previous relationship. The only location which I can explain is that of proximity to P.H.J.H. We parked nearby one evening.

My dream takes place in the basement of what appears to be my former high school (G). I remember that it is quite dark in the basement and I was alone. I approached a stairway leading from the basement outside and see the outline of a tall, heavily built man, his back to me, bolting the door. I cannot remember seeing his face. Be turned around and I screamed for help. There was a leather couch down in the basement, exactly like the one found in the MA lounge. I can't remember details, but I got the impression that he attacked me. The next thing I remember is being outside, crying, and seeing my boyfriend. I rush toward him and bury my head in his shoulder. A policeman appears on the scene and at the same time my attacker. My boyfriend points the man out to the policeman, who takes him away.
Interpretation
Two possibilities occur to me in interpretation of this dream. Perhaps the dream actually represents a fear of being attacked. We live in a practically totally negro-populated neighborhood. I have felt a bit scared upon walking down the street at night, but somehow I don't think it would manant a dream of this type. Stretching the imagination a bit, I can see that it might indirectly point to a desire for sexual intercourse. However in that case there seems to be an element of fear involved and as far as I know I am not afraid of having intercourse.

I am sitting at a long table similar to those found in T living. The room appears to be one found in SBL. I am working on my English Source theme. There are a few people at the table, but I'm not sure of their identity or sex. One of them has some cards which contain information for a source theme. I look them over, thinking that perhaps I can use the information, when someone tells me that it concerns E. (My theme deals with the A C) I see a woman and her little girl approaching. I remember thinking there was something very odd about the little girl. Her face was very different looking as were her clothes. I saw her features and those of her mother very clearly, yet they were totally unfamiliar to me. Her mother addresses her as The Princess. The little girl goes to put out a book, but a man enters the scene. I think he prevented her from taking the book. I remember that the little girl kept smiling. She appeared to be about seven or eight years old. The dream gets confused here. There seems to be a conspiracy to see that no one leaves the library alive. But, without speaking, there seems to be an agreement between the librarian and me to see that I leave unharmed.
Interpretation
I can well understand my dreaming about the source theme. It is due Wednesday and I haven't started it as yet. (writing it, that is.) The cards probably represent the fact that I feel I don't have enough information to write a source theme with. I put off the writing for today and have had no little anxiety concerning it. The episode of the woman and little girl doesn't bring anything to mind. Although the fact that she referred to her as the princess probably refers to the much publicised Princess Elizabeth's wedding. The episode of impending death would seem to indicate a fear of death on my part, but an uneacelingness to believe that it could actually happen to me. I confess to having given the matter a great deal of thought at various times in my life, but none recently. I know that I do not fear death, my only fear is that I may die young, before having experienced a happy married life and the joy of having children.

This dream I am not a participant at any time. The dream first takes place in a train terminal. I see a boy and girl embracing. Some voice says that they both have one interest in common: oil. I then see two pipes which seem to be going up and down. The next thing I remember is their being married and settled in an apartment. There seems to be a story teller in my dream. He says that this marriage is a triangle including the man, his wife, and his mother-in-law. The mother-in-law continually called her daughter to remind her of appointments, etc. In the next scene the girl is making supper. She opens the icebox and I saw a gallon jar in the icebox. It contained huge pink and red roses in a fluid. On the bottom of the jar there is a label which gives a company name and says they preserve wedding flowers. The girl then looks into the stove. I see what appear to be different types of leftovers (meat pie, etc.) being reheated. The girl wonders if there will be enough and says she will just eat a little.
Interpretation
I do not understand the "oil" element of this dream. This dream seems to be another of a series of dreams concerning marriage, which I am contemplating. I can well understand the occurrence of mother-in-law in the dream as I am a bit frightened at the prospect of acquiring one. I did not get off to such a good start with my boyfriend's mother and am afraid I may run into a little difficulty with her. The preserved flowers represent my proposed marriage, I suppose. The food episode seems to represent my anxiety that we will not be able to live on $90 a month.

College women, late 1940s:#0449 (Code 064, Age 21, 12/08/47)

I am in a department store (resembling H--). I seem to be on a floor other than the first. Preparations are being made for a style show, in which I am to participate. I seem to be wearing a wool dress of checked material. I get on an elevator going down, but when we get to the basement I notice the belt of my dress is missing. We return to the same floor and then find that the belt is in the elevator. I put it on, and at first it doesn't seem to match the dress, but then later it does. We return to the basement. The style show is already in progress. The audience seated in rows or benches, seems to be composed of all young people. A girl whom I know is master of ceremonies. She brings out a dog and a duck and says they allow no petting there. Then I wondered if perhaps I hadn't heard wrong, maybe she said "We allow no pets here." One of the models has already gone on the stage. I wonder where the other models are and where we are to go. Another girl is with me, I don't know who she is. We go into a little building. One wall is off allowing us to see into it. I see girls lying in bed in P. J.'s studying. I then see a girl (who is in my S-- class). She is fully clothed. I ask her if she knows where the models are. She goes to the window and points to a small building. I ask her how I can get there. I think perhaps I can climb out the window, but when I look down I notice that it's quite a jump. I ask her if there is a back door and she says "yes" We go out the back door and see a group of girls standing in a row. I am particularly impressed with the variety of bright colors which they are wearing. I recognize one of the girls as my former roommate. She is dressed in bright yellow. She waves to me and shouts that she is getting her grades the next day.
Interpretation
The theme of my dream would seem to indicate a desire for clothes. My wardrobe has been quite depleted and I have been contemplating replenishing it. I have been pretty anxious about my lack of clothes as I do not feel as self-confident when I am not well dressed. My boyfriend, also, has been insisting that I buy myself something to wear. The appearance of the duck and dog, I guess was a convenient way to introduce the theme of petting into my dream. I am contemplating getting engaged and we have discussed the possibility of petting as a preparation for the intimacies of marriage. However, both of us decided we would have severe feelings of guilt if we did pet. I cannot account for the balance of my dream except to state that the girl who is in my S-- class has always reminded me of a model.

I remember walking out of a house and continuing my walk down a main thoroughfare. A man (short, middle-aged, shabby) unfamiliar to me is following me. He has something wrapped in newspaper which he wants to sell me. He says something to me and I remember the word "cotton." I tell him "no" and cross the street. He follows me. Then somehow he gets ahead of me. I throw a glass at him, but miss. I see a group of people gather around a woman who is stretched on the ground. A young woman is crying: She says her mother's hand has been cut off. I draw close and see a huge scar across the hand of the woman. There is no blood. I keep repeating "I did it, I did it." I was awakened abruptly by my father at this part--it was 7:10 in the morning.
Interpretation
I cannot determine what the man stands for in my dream. The woman I feel, although I hate to admit, would seem to be my boyfriend's mother. She didn't look like her, but the scar on her hand resembled the one my boyfriend has on his wrist. This dream corroborates my other dream analysis in which I stated that I was afraid that my relationship with my future mother-in-law may not be a very happy one.

I seemed to be in a drawing class sitting around a long table. The class was instructed to draw a duck. Another girl was sitting at my table but I can't remember who she was. We were asked to come to the front of the room to hear a story. All of the girls sit down on small chairs. I sit down and then change my seat. Our teacher is a young woman (in her twenties, unfamiliar to me). Everyone had a white sheet in front of them with a pencil. I had no pencil, but tell myself that I will be able to remember. One of the girls reads a story about ducks. All of the girls laugh. We then go back to our seats. It's getting dark. Another class comes up from the basement ready to go home. This class consists of all small children, mostly dressed in snowsuits. I get angry because we have not been told to go home. Then teacher says we can go home and wishes us a happy Easter. Someone turns the lights off and I cannot find my crayons. I look in my box (resembling my evening bag) and see only two crayons. I look on the table and see a bunch of little stubs of crayons and some large ones, but can't determine their color in the dark. Someone (a man) tries to find the light but cannot. I become very angry. A girl (about 21, in my E-- class) comes up to me and shows me her hand, palm up. I see a ring. I turn my hand up and she says "Oh, you've got one, too!" I ask her if she just got hers. She says "no." Her ring is smaller than mine and she says she couldn't wear my size. I tell her that my hand is proportionately larger.
Interpretation
This dream seems to tie in with the Christmas dinner we had at my fiance's home. The duck would seem to represent the goose we ate. After dinner my fiance and I had a discussion about how differently our respective homes were run- the fact that his mother was much more economical in buying and using her food and in furnishing her home. I guess the discussion raised a doubt in my mind as to whether or not he and I would see eye to eye on the expenditure of money. The episode of the ring is pretty obvious to me. I became engaged ~ few weeks ago and as is pretty common with girls, I wondered what others would think of my ring. I was also a little doubtful as to whether I liked it or not. The drawing and crayons I find difficult to fit in as I have no interest in them and can't imagine what they could symbolize. Easter probably represents Christmas. The only thing I am reminded of with regard to the lights is that before my fiance and I had our discussion, we had to turn on the light in the kitchen.

This dream was quite a bit longer, but all I can remember is that the stone seemed to have come loose from my diamond engagement ring. At first I thought I had lost it, but someone helped me find it (I think it was my fiance, age 23)
Interpretation
My fiance and I had a long talk New Year's morning. I hadn't spent a very happy renew Year's Eve and we were attempting to get to the bottom of it. The dream seems to symbolize his attempt to help me out of my difficulty. I had not been very proud of him that night and we both wondered if it would occur again. He told me that if it occurred with too great frequency we would probably not be very happy together and in such an event we would have to terminate our engagement. I told him I'd try hard not to let little things bother me because I think we can have a successful marriage. Finding the stone seems to indicate a happy ending, and in truth the evening ended on a happy note.

I seemed to be attending a party in my home. I recognized two of the people as being my cousin (a girl, age 30) and her husband. There were many people present. I was holding a baby which seemed to be my cousin's. He talked quite fluently for his age and I was much impressed by his intelligence. The scene shifts to my aunt's home (age 40). She seems to be showing me around her house. We come to one room that is empty and looks as if it had not been used in years. She then shows me a bedroom and I particularly notice the gay bedspread and matching drapes. We come to another room and I notice that it contains a double bed and two twin beds. I seem to owe her some money and she brings out a white slip with pencilled items on it and starts to figure.
Interpretation
The party probably represents the engagement party my mother plans to give in my honor quite soon. My cousin probably enters the dream as we were discussing the fact that she recently had a miscarriage. The scene in my aunt's home probably occurred because of the lengthy conversations I have had with my fiance, my parents and friends about the difficulty of finding an apartment and my wondering about how I would furnish it. The empty room can probably be explained by the fact that if we get a house or a large apartment we will probably close off one room as we cannot afford to furnish an entire house. The issue of twin and double beds arose in our discussion (my fiancees and mine) and we found that a double bed had the greater asset balance. The slip and its figures represents my aunt's charge acct. at a wholesale house for linens which she suggested to us was at our disposal when I buy linens.

I walked over to T Library to look up a book in the catalogue. I went around to the entrance on the West Side of the building but the door was locked and there was a sign on the door giving directions to go around to the front entrance on E Avenue. I knew there wasn't any entrance on E but I went anyway. When I got there I found a beautiful building of Georgian architecture - long and low with about 10 pillars. It was beautifully landscaped with grass, evergreens and tall trees. I just stood and looked at it.

My mother - age 43 - and I were sitting in a theater waiting for the performance to start (I don't know what kind of show it was, it might have been a movie, a play or an opera) and we were the only ones sitting in the section of seats about half-way back close to the side. Then about 20 famous movie stars came in and sat all around us. They kept making all kinds of noises, laughing, singing, and talking and I couldn't keep my mind on the performance. So I told my mother I was leaving and I would be back in a few minutes. I don't know where I went or what I did but when I came back the movie stars were gone and my mother was sitting among ordinary people who were quietly enjoying the performance.

I was in a brightly lighted room in the dormitory with about 10 other people (2 boys). There was an operating table in the middle of the room. Two men walked in the door wearing white coats like doctors wear and carrying huge bags. They were tree surgeons and they had come to operate on a tree. They said they didn't need to wear gloves or use an anesthetic because the tree wasn't really an alive human being. Then they took out a saw and one of them began to saw off slices of the tree supposedly, but it was a human foot. They sliced off pieces just like meat (only it looked like cork). I said I couldn't stay and watch and I ran from the room. One of the fellas said he was staying because he thought it was interesting.

There were about 50 people sitting at long tables in a ball at a banquet. My mother was sitting at the head table and I was sitting at a table near the back of the room. There was a very small glass of milk in front of me and I drank it down in an instant. Then I hollered at my mother at the head table to get me some more milk. She had brought me too small a glass. She said she was sorry and went out of the room to get me another glass. That's all I remember because I was awakened at this point.

I saw H___ A___ run out of a department store in A___ with his arms loaded down with oranges, pears, apples and grapes. He kept dropping fruit all over and he also dropped a toy truck that had a great number of little white blocks in it. The blocks fell out all over the floor and two clerks one a girl and the other a younger boy stopped to pick them up. The girl just stood and counted them while the boy put them in the truck. Among the blocks was a spool of thread. I was watching the proceedings and I was scared that they were going to discover the spool of thread. For some reason if they saw the thread H__ would be in some kind of danger. But the boy thought the spool was another block and put it in the truck. I was relieved and I walked away.

Four girl friends in the dormitory and I were out on the porch roof of G____ Dormitory at night loading pamphlets into a dirigible that was hovering over the porch.

College women, late 1940s:#0481 (Code 070, Age 20, 09/27/47)I dreamed I was at my own wedding (I am not married). I was conscious of the fact that although my mother (age 44), my father (age 47), and my sister (age 22) were quite nervous, I had an overwhelming feeling of contentment and happiness. As we walked down the aisle, which was down the center of an extremely large ballroom, the small orchestra was playing "A1ways." My groom (his face was not clear to me, and it was no one I know) was already at the altar and he was watching me intently. It took a long time for my parents and me to walk down the aisle; but all the while I returned my groom's gaze although I was aware that my parents were nodding to people in the audience and smiling at them. Suddenly, with my eyes still on my husband to be, I started to sing along with the orchestra. My mother was very startled and appeared to be a little embarrassed at my unconventiality, but my father quietly said to her, "This is all hers." My dream ends while I was still walking down the aisle and singing, and the whole audience, and my parents, were smiling and some of them were crying because of the great love my fiance and I had for each other.

In reality, I remember at by cousin's wedding she had the orchestra play this same song instead of the bridal march and it impresses me a great deal. My groom's and my staring at each other, I might interpret, as a strong desire to fall in love and be very much loved in return.Interpretation

I, myself, was carrying a miniature piano and I was practicing several tunes I had composed myself. While I was playing, I could hear the others laughing and joking; and I was so afraid that I could not meet their standards, that I started to cry. I wondered why they did not need any practice and why I required so much. In the midst of my playing and with tears streaming down my face, I realized that suddenly a hush had come over the room. I kept on playing with an intense vigor and soon, the rest of the musicians had taken up their instruments and were accompanying me. When I finished, they all applauded me and I soon joined the group with a great feeling of satisfaction and happiness.

College women, late 1940s:#0483 (Code 070, Age 20, 10/08/47)The lady across the hall from our apartment was acting very suspicious, it seemed to me. Heretofore, she had scarcely even been around the apartment. Lately, I had noticed she was bringing much food to the house, and that a number of packages were being delivered to the apartment, too. I decided then to do a little sleuthing. I took a ladder and placed it against the bedroom window. I carefully climbed up and just as I thought, there was a man sleeping in the bed. His face looked familiar to me but I couldn't remember from where. That night, I was reading the newspapers; and there across the front page was a picture of the man I had seen with a bold caption of "Wanted" above it. Of course, I immediately called the police, the criminal was apprehended, and I was a glorified heroine.

When the streetcar came, I helped her on and then took her to a seat. She asked me to sit next to her, so I did. All the way to my destination, she told me about how she had always wanted a granddaughter but that she only had grandsons. She said she wanted to repay me in some way; and although, I was insistent that there was no need for it, she finally obtained my name and address.

He kept chasing me around the block; but despite the many people on the streets (many were C-- whom I knew) and despite the fact that he was blind, he relentlessly pursued me. He finally caught me and I tearfully told him that I had meant no harm. He started to laugh and said he was just trying to demonstrate that pity was wasted on him. Besides, he told me, he liked the sound of my voice. We then proceeded to tell all about ourselves to each other and I found out that he was a famous athlete.

College women, late 1940s:#0497 (Code 070, Age 20, 02/12/47)This dream was a series of vague and confused incidents, and I am sure there was much more to it than I can remember. I remember roller skating down a side walk in a rather unsteady manner, being conscious at the time that I could do much better than I appeared to be doing. Then I found myself in a car at the top of a hill with a middle-aged woman (I have no idea who she was). The woman was trying to park the car in front of her garage, but since the brakes did not work on the first two attempts, we rolled back down the hill both times--I was very frightened. The third time, however, the brakes held and we got out of the car. Then somehow or other I found myself in an amusement park with about four boys and girls my own age (I cannot identify them either). We seemed to be just standing around eating popcorn.

College women, late 1940s:#0498 (Code 070, Age 20, 02/21/47)I dreamed that our house was about to be burglarized by a middle-aged man. I was the only one up, the rest of the family having gone to bed, when I heard someone trying to take the screen door off the porch. At the time I thought he was making an unusual amount of noise for a burglar. Since he seemed to be making rapid progress, I started upstairs to awaken my father, but decided instead to telephone the police. Just before I woke up I was thumbing frantically through the telephone book trying to find the phone number of the police department.

College women, late 1940s:#0500 (Code 070, Age 20, 03/08/47)I can only remember walking down a street late at night, and coming to a department store which was built directly on the street and sidewalk, so that I had to pass through the store in order to continue on my way.

However, the cafeteria was out-of-doors wherein each person picked whatever he wanted directly from the ground where it was growing. As I was passing down the line, didn't find very many items of food which suited me, because, for some reason or other they seemed too fancy or too cumbersome. When I reached the cashier I found that fifty cents was the minimum, and since my lunch was much less than this, I bought several chances on a bicycle that was being raffled.

They had brand new children's tricycles and were very happily riding them about. As soon as they saw me, they started to show off by standing up while riding. They were too big for the bicycles and when they stood up while riding, I kept warning them it was unsafe and they should be more careful and sit down. The 16 yr. old smiled very sweetly (which made me quite angry) and listened quietly and patiently till I stopped talking, then she and her sister went on riding as before, standing up. Then the 16 yr. old rode sitting down and I rode along on the back of her bike. We came to a place in which the sidewalk was uneven. There seemed to be a difference of only a couple of inches in the height of the 2 slabs of concrete, but when I looked down, it seemed like a canyon. I was frightened.

She took it with the others and had her mother return it to me the next day which made me angry. Often I've thought she and her sister are really little girls trying to act more adult.Interpretation

I started to run again; each time I thought I was near the source of the voice, it came from another direction. Then I was running about wildly. My clothes and hair were being blown about by the wind. I was sweating profusely and wiped my face on my forearm as I ran. Soon, I became frightened and exhausted.

The doctors and nurses I worked with were in the dream. The patients' faces were not too clear. The dream was very real in that it seemed I could actually feel the waves of muscular contractions of the patients as I leaned on them. The preparations were very clear.

There were many small shops on the street selling millinery and ladies' clothing. All the stores were closed. (This did not seem unnatural; it must have been Sunday.) As I looked in one store, I saw a woman putting hats into a drawer. As we passed, she looked up and I was surprised to recognize her. (We had lived on the same street for 10 years.) I have not seen her for 2 years. She beckoned to us to stop. Then she opened the door and let us in. We talked and she told me she was selling Bissell carpet sweepers and could get us a good discount. Mother said to me confidentially that maybe she ought to buy a Bissell at a discount instead of the electric sweeper she had been wanting. I remember that all the while we were talking, I kept looking at her and thinking how attractive she had become.

Instead, I walked near the rear of the store and waited for someone, the manager or a salesman to notice me. There were 4 seats, similar to the ones for giving shoe shines--There were 2 facing each way (in other words, they were back to back). There were 2 boys sitting in the 2 raised chairs facing me. I did not know the boy farthest from me. The closer one (approximate age 25), I recognized as a boy with whom I'd double dated several times. Then as I was about to say hello to him he stood up and his face changed. I recognized him as another fellow I know (approximate age 20) who had been badly burned in a fire about 5 weeks ago. I knew his face had been burned. When I remembered this fact, I noticed that his face changed. The hairline changed too and I noticed that near the face, the hair was thin and short. I thought that this was because it probably had been burned away and was just starting to grow back. I called his name and he smiled at me.

College women, late 1940s:#0526 (Code 071, Age 20, 11/31/47)I dreamed I was at sorority meeting at S's house. All the girls were seated around the living room and they began to discuss our barn dance. I remained silent, but was inwardly seething. Finally, I could contain myself no longer. I rose and made a fervent speech. I was very excited and practically shouted. In my speech, I told the girls I was resigning from the sorority. Then, as I spoke I calmed down a bit and reminded the girls that in the initiation, the president told us that one of the key pearls in our pin stood for cooperation. I reminded them how very uncooperative and inconsiderate they had been about the barn dance. The two girls who had been particularly nasty began to weep--begged me not to resign. Then all the girls chimed in and I began to sway my opinion. When the dream ended though, I was still undecided.

The night before my dream, my sorority was supposed to hold a barn dance, but the weather was bad, roads dangerous. We met at S's house. Then began a discussion that finally led to an argument as to whether we should stay in town and have a party (which could have easily been arranged) or travel 30 miles to camp in dangerous weather to have the dance. As a result all except 3 couples went to camp. I was one of those who stayed in town. We were all quite aggravated and upset because of the way things turned out. I didn't argue, but the juvenile exhibition of temper tantrums put on by some of the others made me feel ashamed in front of my date.Interpretation

The dream was not definite on this point, but I believe I was working there and the doctors asked me to pretend that I was a patient to get some information about one of the women patients. I did this. We were in a ward. A large room with pillars in it and it had a marble floor. I was in a regular hospital bed next to the bed of the woman I was to observe. Her bed was similar to mine, except that hers had a cage-like affair over it so she couldn't get out. There was a trap door on it and it was of wooden posts with copper screening over all. We were talking and I was frightened at being a patient in such a place and petrified of this woman. She was pale and had large, boring eyes and stringy brown hair. She spoke to me and confided in me and I sympathized with her. I pretended I was a mental case, too, and told her I wished I were dead. Then, I saw her strong, powerful arms reach up and open the trap door on the cage over her bed. She said she'd take care of my body after I was dead. I knew she was going to strangle me. I wanted to scream but couldn't. My fear was overpowering. Then, I saw a nurse coming towards me (this nurse I recognized as the receptionist nurse I work with). The woman's (patient's) hands closed the trap door and she got back into her bed. Then, I fell back on my bed, my heart was pounding and I was weak. I wanted to cry. This nurse (who didn't wear a cap) and another nurse (unknown to me) wheeled my bed out and into another room. They said I had a one o'clock patient that I had to give an electroencephalogram test--then after I gave the test, I was to go back to the ward and keep pretending I was a patient. I was terrified. I said if that woman patient should see me in uniform and recognize me as a worker not a patient she'd kill me (I knew she'd strangle me) I became almost hysterical. What would I do? Then the dream ended as the 2 nurses wheeled my bed back to the ward. I was to stay there till one o'clock--time to do the test, etc. When I was back in the ward, I was weak and frightened. I lay there, opened my eyes and saw the woman staring at me, her eyes boring into me, suspicion written on her face and I lost all hope. I knew she'd kill me.

Can't interpret. The receptionist is a good friend to me. In the dream, she saved me from death. This may show how much I think of her and of her loyalty to me. I thought the doctor's place very unwise--for me to do the EEG test and then go back to the ward--it placed me in such danger. This may show that often I do not approve of all the things the doctors tell me to do and think their plans sometimes aren't too wise.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0530 (Code 071, Age 20, 01/01/48)I dreamed I was wearing a white uniform and was lying on a bed at the place where I work. Dr. G-- (about 30) came into the room with an enormous hypodermic in his hand. He gave me an injection in my right arm. He stood by to see what effect the injection would have on me. I became more and more drowsy. Soon I became aware that Danny Kaye was singing "Anatole of Paris." The record repeated itself over and over again. I wanted desperately to get up and turn off the record. But I could not lift my arms or legs. I could not even make my eyelids go up--as much as I wanted to open my eves. Even though my eyes were closed I knew the doctor was still standing at my side.

This doctor gave me an album of Danny Kaye records for an Xmas gift. My favorite record in the album was "Anatole of Paris." This doctor (whom I work with) had also given me an injection about a week previous to the dream when I didn't feel well while at work. The injection he gave me in reality had the same effect as it had in the dream.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0531 (Code 071, Age 20, 01/05/48)I saw a big house on top of a hill. It had great big glass windows with no curtains at the windows. As I went up the hill, I was wondering why there were no curtains. Then I went inside. There was a man (about middle-aged) who lived in this house. He was very ominous-looking. He had dark hair and a heavy mustache. Many young girls (about 20 years of age) lived in this house. The man seemed to dominate all the girls. He painted all the time. Maybe he used the girls as models. They would do whatever he said. The man reminded me of Orson Welles. The furniture in this house was oversized--extremely large. I disliked the man intensely.

College women, late 1940s:#0532 (Code 071, Age 20, 01/12/48)I dreamed I was walking the dog. It was spring and I was so absorbed in my own thoughts I didn't notice when the dog disappeared. Finally, I realized it-was dark. I could see no lights. It was absolute blackness. I felt my way along the street. My home had one tiny light in the window. When I reached the house I saw that the dog was sitting on the porch. She recognized my footsteps and barked joyously and wagged her tail. I was furious with the dog for having run away. I let her into the house. Then I beat the dog for having run away. I let her into the house. Then I beat her. She squealed and finally bit my hand. I began to cry and threw myself on the couch holding my bitten hand and crying. I was sorry I'd lost my temper and beaten the dog.

The dog often does run away. She had run away from my brother that evening. He doesn't punish the dog though. Many times, I feel like punishing the dog but don't because of my brother.

I was wearing 2 white orchids. I felt on the verge of tears. My mother was weeping bitterly. My dad and brother were sad too, but they didn't carry on so. The whistle blew. I knew it was our last chance to board the ship. I couldn't make up my mind. I looked at my mother and then at my husband trying to decide. Finally, I put my arms around my mother and kissed her good-bye. Then, I turned to my husband who put his arm around me and we slowly walked up the gangplank. At first, I tried to keep the tears back then I broke down and cried and cried. 

My mother actually is unhappy that I should consider marrying this boy (the one who was my husband in the dream) because when he graduates he will go abroad for a couple of years. My mother opposed the marriage because she doesn't want me to live in another country, or even in another city. I am still undecided, though. We had been discussing this before I went to sleep.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0534 (Code 071, Age 20, 01/15/48)I dreamed I was in a car with a lot of my friends, boys and girls about my own age. (I didn't recognize any of my friends in real life.) We were driving to a party in a suburb of C--. It was snowing outside. Finally, after we got to the house, I went in and took off my coat. The house was crowded and was thick with smoke. I sat down on a maroon sofa. No one else was sitting on it. Then the hostess walked over and handed me a glass. It looked like ginger ale but I suspected there was liquor in it and did not taste the drink. Someone else came over and introduced Dr. --- to me. (This is a person I had been dating, but hadn't seen in 2 months; was quite depressed.) I looked up. It was the same person, yet he didn't look the same. He wasn't as handsome. He sat down on a chair next to the sofa and was toying with his drink. His sleeves were up a little and I could see he had hairy arms. We conversed. But he had a know-it-all attitude, was curt and abrupt and almost rude. A smile was on his lips all the time. Then everyone seemed to dissolve and there was just the 2 of us. He put down his drink, sat down next to me on the sofa. I knew he was going to kiss me. Then he put his arms around me. I was expectant. When he did kiss me I pushed him away. I didn't like it and I didn't like him any more. I knew then that he had never had any true love for me and had merely been leading me on. I saw him then for what he really was.

I had been thinking of him for some time. I had thought I was in love with him. Everyone told me he didn't really care for me but I couldn't believe it. Recently, I met someone else who was so fine and considerate I couldn't help comparing the 2 men. This dream was a sign to me that I shouldn't waste my time thinking of him any more. He had merely been "stringing me along."Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0535 (Code 074, Age 20, 02/17/47)I was in a ten-cent store, one that I was familiar with, except that I noticed one counter was misplaced--the comb counter. I was shopping for decorations and little nonsense gifts for a party. There was a man with me but he had no definite features rather like a shadow. The salesgirls were all very enthused about a book that had arrived that day with ideas on what to do with lace and fringe. One of the girls or I should say a middle aged, tall, emaciated woman had on a black kimono and was trying a pink net shawl over this in different ways. I told her to sew it instead of pinning it. I then proceeded to buy my gifts. I tried to get some balloons but was unable to get the color that I wanted. I next stopped at the comb counter to get a good strong comb but the selection was poor and the only ones that were left were too flexible.

My aunt who is about forty said something to me and the next thing I knew I was standing in front of a large brick and stucco house that looked Austrian in appearance. A little boy was knocking on the door, suddenly he turned and threw a snowball at another little boy standing next to me, the snowball hitting him on the head. The next thing I knew I was on the second floor of this house. Seated around the room were some Austrians in their native costumes, drinking beer. On one side of the room were three or four very close friends of mine. Some very competent people were setting up apparatus for a radio program. I noticed a plump, blond girl specially. After this I found myself setting up laboratory equipment. 

A tall boy with glasses was working my experiment for me. We were working with a poisonous solution which constantly foamed and boiled over. Suddenly this boy dropped whatever he was holding, gave a yell, went into convulsions, and fell to the floor hitting his head on a board. I went back to my experiment and noticed the boy get up, take a blanket and went upstairs with the appearance of having known exactly what had happened.

College women, late 1940s:#0537 (Code 071, Age 20, 02/27/47)It was a beautiful summer morning. I was working for a nursery school, and it was up to me to pick up one certain child and walk with her to school. The child was about two years old and had dark curly hair. As we walked along we stopped into each house along the way to receive what might be called little hand-outs. The child was getting tired and I began skipping houses. By the time we got to the school I was carrying the child in a knapsack hanging on my left shoulder. The next thing I remember I was on my own street. There was a garden party on our front lawn and all the neighbors were gathered. I was told to go down the street to deliver something to a house which was five houses from a house I knew well, but I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find it.

We came to a house which was only half completed. It belonged to a newly married couple. The wife had just finished setting the table for company. There were no doors or windows in the house, merely places where they should have been. The house looked like it had been struck by fire. In fact there was a woman around the age of thirty-two who was standing in the corner and ironed. She said that there had been a fire that day, but that she had to finish ironing the little girl's dress. We all left the house when the guests began to arrive. 

The next scene was in a garage where I was with a boy my own age who was trying to get the car in a tight parking place.

We rushed to the auditorium and there we saw some old friends. I remember one very distinctly. He was a boy who went to high school with us. Now he goes to Harvard. In a Bostonian accent, I told this to my friends. They all smiled knowingly. I noticed that the Harvard boy was wearing a white tie and tails. He was a member of the local band. The show began and the announcer said that this was a special show with many acts. The first act was that three girls from the audience should come to the stage and each sit next to some boy and they would be married. It turned out that we were the three girls. I was the first one to walk down the aisle. I sat down next to a boy named Douglas and we were married. After the marriage, I left him and wondered if it were true. I then woke up.

College women, late 1940s:#0552 (Code 074, Age 20, 09/27/47)I was walking in a park one day when I realized I was trying to get to a house on the very top of a hill. I remember this walk very distinctly for it was very rugged. I remember where there used to be steps, these were now just a rolling mass of mud with a steel ridge on either side. You could either walk on the ridge or slide up the mud. There were other obstacles, too, such as high walls and waterfalls. It was a very long walk which seemed to take hours, but I at last reached the top. When I got there, I was shoved into a room with many others. There was a man there discussing posture. He looked at me and seemed very happy. He picked on me immediately, saying I was bowlegged. I listened and listened to him. At the end of his long speech, a very fat woman tried to help me by saying, "You must be very still while in bed." Then I said that I knew I was bowlegged and that my mother tried using braces on my legs but nothing helped them. However, I was taking a Body Mechanics course at Reserve and they had promised that that would help me. Everybody looked relieved and I woke up.

It seemed as if I was walking on a moving platform, getting nowhere. At least I reached the phone, and it wasn't ringing any more. When I actually woke up from this ringing sensation, the phone was silent.

My father, who is a physician often receives many calls at night, so I naturally have a tender ear for the ringing of a telephone. Lately, because of a very sick woman, there has been more calls than usual. This has kept the family awake many times during the night.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0555 (Code 074, Age 20, 10/11/47)I was trying to buy some records in a record shop, and I wanted to get the flat, black disks like everyone elses, but the man was trying to talk me into getting a disk that was in the shape of the wax that a dentist puts in your mouth when he wants to take an impression. This record was blue on one side and pink on the other side. I remember that the record fit into the victrola just as an impression fits into a person's mouth. I felt very nauseated. I insisted, however, upon the black, flat records, and finally bought them and walked out of the store. 

(202 words)

As far as records are concerned, we just got a new victrola and have purchased some new records. Last week, the dentist took impressions of my lower and upper teeth. This is a very nauseating business, and one that I will not forget for a long time. I remember that the record had little ridges on it just like the gums have on the roof of your mouth.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0556 (Code 074, Age 20, 10/16/47)When we would come home from school, on the way we would play with frisky little monkeys. They would try to be very ferocious, but we could control them. One day, one of the girls was playing with an extra ferocious monkey. He got mad, grabbed the girl, and rushed down the street. Some man grabbed the monkey's tail, and also was carried down the street. He was trying to protect the terrified girl. We all thought it was a big joke until we saw that the man had caught his tie in a washing machine, and couldn't get loose. The girl in the meantime was having a bad way with the monkey. I rushed to the washing machine and tried to find the handle to turn it off, but this was difficult because of the great deal of newspaper that were covering the machine. The man looked very sick, but he found the handle and turned it off. At this point, my alarm went off. 

(237 words)

I have no idea why I dreamed of monkeys, but as far as the washing machine is concerned, I think I can find some relationship. For many weeks now, my mother has had trouble with our old washing machine, and we have been on the lookout for a new one.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0557 (Code 074, Age 20, 10/20/47)A person who didn't seem to be me because the person was a man was combing his hair. It seemed as if a lot of dandruff was falling on his shoulders. This person combed and combed and still more dandruff fell. Another man suggested that he use a special comb devised to get rid of dandruff. The comb was hollow, and when dipped in some oil, it would retain the oil for several days, and a person's hair would never get dry if he used this comb. Dryness was the cause of dandruff. So this man, who seemed to be me and yet was not me, bought the comb and asked for a haircut. The barber said, however, that they didn't cut hair there. We ran out of the shop. I now seem to be myself and the man is someone else.

College women, late 1940s:#0558 (Code 074, Age 20, 11/02/47)I was going to the H-- Theater with my brother and my Aunt R--. We didn't have any tickets so we were going to buy them when we got to the box office. There were two shows that night, the six o'clock show and the 8:30 show. My aunt and I wanted to go to the 6:oo show and my brother wanted to attend the 8:30 show. We argued for quite a while and then decided to each go our own way. My aunt and I then went to the ticket office to get the tickets, but there weren't any left for the six o'clock so we decided to wait for cancellations. The manager told us we were tenth in line waiting for cancellations. We waited and waited. At last, we decided it was futile, and we asked for tickets for the 8:30 show. However, there were none left for that show either. I felt very angry with my brother. I felt it was all his fault. I was brooding when my alarm went off.

The Wednesday before the dream I had just seen "Harvey" at the H-. I enjoyed the play very much. The peculiar thing about the dream was that we had just managed to get tickets about an hour before the performance. Interpretation
The last week or two, I have been arguing with my brother a great deal about a certain matter. The idea that I was at the H-- with him was absurd, because I never go anywhere with him. He and his wife think I am far too young. This may be wishful thinking.

College women, late 1940s:#0559 (Code 074, Age 20, 11/04/47)I was in an auditorium listening to an assembly when I noticed an old friend sitting behind me. He saw me and smiled. He is about twenty years old. When the assembly was over, he stood up and said to his friend, who was sitting next to him, that I was his wife. When we started taIking, he asked me for a date. I accepted, and as we were about to leave, a man fell dead on the stage. We rushed to the stage and crowded around the man. The man turned out to be another friend of mine. When I turned around to look at my husband (I accepted him my husband now), he was grinning from ear to ear, and I was very angry. 

(199 words)

The boy had an odd resemblance to my brother. Since I have been thinking about him lately, it seems quite logical that he should come up in my dreams. He is very boyish and grins a good deal.

College women, late 1940s:#0560 (Code 074, Age 20, 11/07/47)I was walking along the street with some other people, all about my age, when we started discussing Carl Becker and his writings. I said that I didn't care for his history book at all and that I thought history was boring. Everybody disagreed with me. It seemed as if we walked for quite a long time still discussing Mr. Becker and his history book. I remember saying that I enjoyed casebooks much better.

All afternoon, I had been reading the Casebook of American Business History by Gras and Larson, and I remember thinking how terribly boring it was, but I had to finish it because it was a history assignment.

College women, late 1940s:#0561 (Code 074, Age 20, 11/14/47)I received an invitation to a bridge party and I got all dressed up to go. I remember wearing my blue suit. When I finally got to the party, there were many girls there, but few who I knew. I stayed there for a very long time when I realized that we were not playing bridge. I then thought to myself that I might be at the wrong party. I was very confused and embarrassed. I realized that I didn't know my hostess and that I had to hurry out of the house. I ran for hours till I finally got to the right party. 

(216 words)

The idea of the bridge party seems very real since I was actually invited to a party of that kind the following Sunday. I had also planned on wearing my blue suit. Why I should confuse about the party, I can't understand except for the fact that I never could understand why the girl that invited me should all of a sudden think of me when we had so little in common and didn't see each other very much.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0562 (Code 074, Age 20, 11/19/47)I was sitting on my bed, which wasn't made when my three guests (which I am expecting next week) walked into my room. I was very surprised to see them, and very embarrassed that they should see my messy room. I, however, was very happy to see them and told them to unpack their clothes immediately, and I would help them. I hung all their clothes in the attic, which seemed a long distance from the main part of the house. They, however, were thrilled with the attic. We all got dressed up that evening, for I was going to have a party that night. My father then came in and I introduced him to the girls. Then six sailors in their white uniforms rushed in and made a dash for the piano. They wore overseas caps. About a half hour later, six more sailors with different kinds of caps rushed in and started singing around the piano. The girls were having a marvelous time.

The three guests in my dream were the girls that I'm expecting over the Thanksgiving vacation. I have been thinking of them quite a bit and thinking of all the ways I can entertain them. I probably have been thinking of it so much, that in my dreams, the entertainment has become quite fantastic. Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0563 (Code 074, Age 20, 11/23/47)I was at a magnificent ball where everybody was dressed very elaborately. The women all had on gold or silver cloth dresses. The men had tuxedos or tails on. Everybody had a banner across his chest as great diplomats wear. I was there, but I didn't seem to be dressed as the others were. I seemed to be an outsider, but no one noticed me. I had a feeling there were people of many countries there.

Before I went to sleep, I thought of the person I had asked for stunt night. He is majoring in international politics. I thought of myself as the wife of a foreign diplomat.

College women, late 1940s:#0564 (Code 074, Age 20, 12/03/47)I was walking up my street when I heard the wild barking of our dog. I shouted for him. I was very glad to see him bounding toward me with all his old vim and vigor. I said to myself that I knew he wasn't dead all the time. We played in the front yard. He barked just as loud as ever and looked black and shiny as before. I could hardly believe he was alive. 

(206 words)

Our dog died Friday morning, November 28th and we all felt pretty bad about it. We had him since he was three weeks old and he died at the age of l4 years. Although he was old, he died more of pneumonia than anything else, I think. He had a bad cough that sounded as if he was choking. We asked the veterinarian about it and he told us to give the dog cough medicine. We did this, but I still have a guilty conscience that I didn't do enough to make him well. This must have been preying on my mind.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0565 (Code 074, Age 20, 12/05/47)My mother was very sick so I took her to the beauty salon where she started taking some electric treatment. The lady in charge told me that my mother would have to take that treatment one hour every day for one year, or else she would never get well. The lady said that I would have to be with my mother during that hour, and, consequently, could not go to school the rest of that year. I felt pretty bad about that, but was willing to do anything for my mother. 

(170 words)

I met a girl a couple of weeks ago who told me about the electric treatment at H_____'s for reducing. Besides that, my mother had a bad headache the day before and she stayed in bed the whole day. My mother and I are very close and I can see why I could easily dream of her.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0567 (Code 074, Age 20, 12/26/47)Daddy, Mom, and I were walking up the street when all of a sudden we saw our dog C-- who died about a month ago. He wabbled up the street. When we went on the sidewaIk, he went on the street and when he went on the sidewalk, we were on the street. We couldn't steer him toward our house. At last we got him to the front door. It was very late at night and we found the front door wide open. Mom was the first one in. She yelled for us to come in also. As we ran around inside the house to see if anyone was there, we found that every door was closed to every room, but nothing in any room was disturbed.

Since I have had a few dreams about our dog C--, who died of pneumonia last month, I feel that it is a sort of guilt feeling about his death. C-- was pretty sick before he died and although we did give him medicine and tried to heIp him, I think we could have done more for him. I foolishly washed him about a week before he died.

College women, late 1940s:#0568 (Code 074, Age 20, 01/04/48)I was living in a big mansion and had just awakened from an afternoon nap. I decided to go swimming in the lake which was near the house. I tried to get someone to go with me. It took a long time to persuade anyone, but at last I convinced them to go with me. However, we decided to go ice-skating instead. I was walking to the pond when I met an old friend, whom I hadn't seen for a few weeks. He was going skating also, but had his boxing gloves instead of ice skates. He tried to excuse himself for not calling me up by saying that he had to go to the doctor for a few days because of a sore hand. When we all reached the pond, we sat in a long row and were asked why the delay. I told the lady in charge that I had forgotten my skates. She thought I was very foolish and everyone was disgusted with me. 

(254 words)

This was a very peculiar dream. The only incident which seemed plausible was the fact that I was wondering why the boy in the dream didn't call me up. He had discussed doctors when I had seen him last because he recently had an appendix operation. I can't understand how the ice-skating got into the dream.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0569 (Code 074, Age 20, 01/05/48)I had just washed my hair and set it. In a few minutes, it was dry and was combing it out. It was turning a bright shade of red as I combed it. I always set a deep wave in the front. This time, I did the same, but when I combed it out, the wave wasn't there. I was very sad about this. I tried to comb the wave back in, but the more I combed, the straighter my hair became on top. I was very disgusted and worried. 

(170 words)

This dream seems rather absurd, but I do take great pains in washing and setting my hair.

College women, late 1940s:#0570 (Code 078, Age 21, 09/25/47)I dreamt that our cleanlng woman, about 50, who has come into our home for many years, was late in finishing her work, because she was sharpening needles in order to listen to the records of the Roman Catholic Mass. I was helping her sharpen the needles, as I was worried that the woman was working overtime. I seem to remember that the time was 4:35 and her quitting time is 4:00. All through this dream, I had the feeling that time was running out, and that I had to hurry. My parents were around somewhere, too, but I don't remember anything else about them in connection with the dream.

We are studying drama connected with the Roman Catholic church service and had a great deal of materlal to cover for Frlday, the day after my dream. I felt a bit unprepared for the lesson and knew that I would have no more time available to prepare the lesson further-this might explain the time running out feeling I experienced. Previously this week, I had discussed Catholicism with someone mentioning the beauty of the music connected with the Mass.

College women, late 1940s:#0571 (Code 078, Age 21, 09/26/47)I was helping in my dad's store, (as is my custom when the benevolent spirit moves me), when a rather tall man, about 40, came in accompanied by a woman. He carried a package which he wanted to mail at our sub-station. He opened the package and showed me two letters which were enclosed. One letter had a three cent stamp on it, the other was unstamped. He asked me for a penny stamp. I told him this was unnecessary. He insisted however, so I went to the stamp drawer and brought him a penny stamp. The woman with him was about thirty or so, and related in some way, but not his wife.

College women, late 1940s:#0572 (Code 078, Age 21, 09/27/47)I was walking past John Hay High School when a teacher, about 60, whose class I had observed the day before, walked out of the building. She carried a pair of scissors and started to cut a bouquet of lovely autumn flowers. I remember orange marigolds, yellow chrysanthemums, and red flowers of one type. She held up the bouquet and I admired it. Strangely enough there were carrots included in the assortment of flowers. She offered me a carrot and I ate it. When I returned home I found that someone had sent a bouquet of flowers and this surprised me. 

(220 words)

This is rather difficult to interpret. But recently I bought a bouquet of flowers for my parents' wedding anniversary and another bouquet was brought by relatives. This might be a repetition in a different form. Carrots are associated with a friend who eats them all the time.

College women, late 1940s:#0573 (Code 078, Age 21, 10/06/47)I dreamt I was out riding with my cousin, age 40 and his wife, about 30. We rode along for sometime and finally a huge amusement park of some sort came into view. The place looked tremendously attractive. The buildings were painted in beautiful bright blues and reds. There were numerous neon lights radiating about. The above description makes the place sound rather garish but really there was a certain unique charm about it and we decided to stop there for awhile. It seems that I had heard something about this place before and from the conversation of my cousin it was apparent that it was very well known. When we entered I felt that I had once been here before, yet, I know of no actual place like it. We entered some sort of building which had a restaurant in one half and a photo studio in the other. A rather nondescript girl, employed at the studio, was showing us samples of their work in photography. The girl was rather young about my age, I imagine. The pictures were mostly bridal pictures. I can't remember anything else.

The riding part might be wishful thinking. Now that the beautiful autumn scenery is coming into view, I wished more than once that I might go out riding to see it.

College women, late 1940s:#0574 (Code 078, Age 21, 10/07/47)I dreamt that I was walking to a class through M-- arch and noticed that a funeral home was located at the same place that M-- House is actually. This place had large glass windows and looking in from the sidewalk where I was, I noticed that a funeral was just ending. The mourners were slowly advancing to the front of the room where the casket was displayed. The corpse was a fair-haired woman about 40 or so, dressed in a black gown. I never saw the face before. Some of the mourners were weeping as they approached the casket. I remembered to myself that I had never seen a dead person and was rather curious to see this one. That seems to be all.

I really can't find anything to relate this to. It might be just a rehashing of stray thoughts about the nearness of funeral homes to the campus.

I know her rather casually, having once doubled with her several months back. She is about 20. We were sitting around a table at some restaurant or other. She asked me what type of man I wanted to marry. I proceeded to tell her and she asked me first of all what height I preferred in a man. I answered 5' 10 ".

College women, late 1940s:#0576 (Code 078, Age 21, 10/24/47)I dreamt that my parents were planning a dinner party for 7:00. Preparations were not yet completed when the doorbell rang and our guests arrived. They were a middle-aged doctor and his wife, actual friends of ours. Mother was dressed in a black and white checked dress and in general the house was in an uproar. We seated our guests at a small table for two. There were two other large tables. one of these tables was occupied by Mother and Dad and several other relatives whom I can't remember. I too, sat with them. The third table was occupied by a group of unknowns, among whom were two girls who had been called to serve that evening. We proceeded with our meal and serving was done in a very inefficient manner. We had chicken, some sort of potatoes and green peas which were dished out into small plates. It seemed to take ages until all the tables were served from the central table where we sat. I kept thinking there wouldn't be enough to go around. Our two guests conversed continually with one another. I noticed that the table was littered with empty ginger ale bottles and told the two girls to clear them away.

This might be the aftermath of a week ago, when I was chairman of a large social gathering. The amount of food we ought to order, the type of serving that was to be done, and all such matters played on my mind for a long time. All went well, but the food almost did run out. Also, this evening the doorbell rang before I expected my date and not being ready, I was rather perturbed. This might have some connection with the early arrival of our dinner guests. I couldn't begin to explain this dream symbolically, but I suppose it has deeper connotations.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0577 (Code 078, Age 21, 10/24/47)I dreamt that a group of us, M-- students, were sitting around in a room in a building on the M-- campus. What this building is I don't really know. I had a vague impression that it was a room in the library, yet this particular place doesn't actually exist. While we were speaking with one another, an old woman, who looked well over 80, came into the room accompanied by a middle-aged woman attendent. The aged woman was dressed in a vivid lavender dress and had striking white hair. Her face was quite lined, and after she left one of the girls mentioned the fact that part of her face was paralyzed. I hadn't noticed this. Before the two women left, they glanced for sometime about the room. Then the oldest woman said, to one of the girls, "Do you know who I am?" The girl replied in the negative, and the woman told her that she was Mrs. H-- who had donated the money for the building we were in. She didn't reveal that she was the donor, but we all knew that she was. She had come to look around before she died, and was pleased to see that all was well here. Then she departed with her companion.

The only connection that I ran make out is that a short time ago I saw several regal dowagers walking through the campus and I somehow imagined them to be donors of one sort or another.

College women, late 1940s:#0578 (Code 078, Age 21, 10/24/47)I dreamt that I met a middle-aged man in S-- S-- who had a most precocious little boy, about three years old. The little boy, who was blonde and blue-eyed was amazingly intelligent. I don't remember our conversation at all, but I do know that this child had almost a mature adult mind. The rapid transit came and the father and the child, along with an older son, about 12 or so boarded it. I went along too. While we rode I was conscious of the steel tracks in front of us and also was aware of the tremendous danger of rolling off the tracks when the rapid made its many turns. The motorman seemed to be aware of this danger too because he went very slowly and mentioned the danger of the slippery steel tracks which gleamed in the sun. The bright little boy sat with his older brother in front of the father. I sat next to the proud parent who gave me a further account of the prodigy.

This dream may be a rehashing of some of the discussions in our education classes about the brilliant child. At the present time, I am more than ever conscious of little children, partly because of a Sunday School class which I have in which there are many bright youngsters about 6 years of age. Parents very frequently discuss their children with me. Because of the fact that the teaching field is new to me, I do have some apprehensions about dealing with some of the problems. This may explain the fear of going off the tracks.Interpretation

College women, late 1940s:#0579 (Code 078, Age 21, 11/06/47)I dreamt that I took a street car ride and finally arrived at the end of my trip. A large brick building which was some sort of club stood there and I walked down a long walk at the side of the building. I was met by a young man I know, about 35, who escorted me to the porch where another man, about 33 was sitting. Both of these men are friends of mine. They sat together on the porch and when they both glanced at me, I noticed an amazing resemblance in their faces. The younger of the two men then accused me of saying that he looked older than the other one. Their eyes flashed a striking blue when they looked at me. That is all that I remember of the dream.

She had been murdered at the country club. While I walked down a corridor, another girl was murdered by a knife which someone threw. I began to be terrified. A young, tall blonde man about 25 or so, offered to take me home. He said that I ought to wait while he ordered a taxi. Finally he returned and we made our way out of the place. A middle-aged man was crouchlng before a blue smoky blaze and he mumbled and chanted in a loud voice. I understood that the murdered girl had been cremated and these were her last remains. Suddenly, the man came toward me, as if to kill me, too. Just as he came close enough to touch me, I awoke.

My friend led me to a book shelf and I leafed through several books. I had in mind the fact that my friend was now engaged to another girl and felt glad that he had found someone else. That is all I remember.

This is a jumble of many things--first of all, my friend is now engaged and his future father-in-law is very fond of him. The proprietor of the book store might represent this.

There was a phonograph playing. The boys then announced they were going to pick a queen. It was like a "hot of the blue." No one was prepared for it - it was a complete surprise. Nevertheless each of the girls had to take a turn encircling the room. After this announcement some other girls arrived on the scene nicely dressed in their good clothes.

College women, late 1940s:#0607 (Code 087, Age 24, 02/15/47)I was with a large gathering of people my own age, most of whom I did not know. (Both sexes were present.) One of the boys was injured in some way. It was a boy (age 22) I had recognized as having been stationed at Ft. while I was there. I only knew him by sight. To my knowledge I was the only graduate nurse in the group so I did what I could to determine the nature of his injury & make him comfortable. However, there was a student nurse present who pushed forward & "took over the show." I, more or less submitted & stood by the sidelines. The ambulance & doctor arrived - & transported the boy to the hospital on a plank. The only symptom he seemed to have was a swelling, redness, tautness of the 3rd finger on his left hand. It was believed that he had a spinal injury. 

The scene changed to a hospital ward. Another nurse (same age) and I were with the patient. The doctor had just left, after arranging some pillows & blankets under the boy's back. Miss D. (32) a supervisor in Nursing arts, with whom I had previously worked came into the room & asked why the pillows had been arranged in such a fashion. She gave me the impression that she thought I was very stupid. Even though we told her that the doctor had arranged them in that manner, she changed them to what she believed was the best and correct way.

Mother had made a delicious apple pie. The crust was "utter perfection." Mother then went upstairs to made some telephone calls. I was to do the dishes. I sat talking to Daddy for a long while, however. Then I looked at my watch, saw that it was 7:30 pm, and decided that I had better get the dishes done before I left. I believe as I remember it that I had to be at some special place a little later in the evening. Daddy came out into the kitchen to help me. He got mad when he found out that I had put the remainder of the pie (not in a pie pan but in a bread pan) back into the oven. He said that the crust would get hard & tough. The gas was not on, however, and the door was open. I saw no difference in the outward appearance of the pie. Mother came down then and told us about the exorbitant prices they had charged for food in restaurants on New Year's Eve. I remember only one place & price she quoted. The SSS had charged 35 cents for a dab of mayonnaise and liver paste on a cracker.

College women, late 1940s:#0612 (Code 087, Age 24, 03/14/47)I was walking down a path, out in the country. The path led thru an athletic field. On one side of me there were tennis courts with men playing; on the other side, a group of men were playing catch. I didn't know any of them. One of the boys playing ball had red hair. We caught each others eye several times. As I kept on walking thru and away from the scene I kept looking back at him. Then I found my self in a dark spot (forest maybe) but I was lying down on a blanket trying to go to sleep. All the while I could still see the boy with the red hair playing catch.

College women, late 1940s:#0614 (Code 087, Age 24, 04/04/47)I was in English class, the day before vacation. Much to my surprise everyone handed in term papers. We had been given the date they were due several weeks ago. I had not realized that today was the date set. I was very exasperated with myself because I had the paper all written but it was only on scrap paper. The papers all seemed to have a lot of drawing and pictures on them and they all looked alike (something like a lab notebook). The only thing I could think to do was to hurry home and copy mine so I could hand it in the same day. I was very worried because I did not want to get a low mark because my paper was late. 

Then the scene changed and I was walking down the street with a girl with long, blond, wavy hair.

College women, late 1940s:#0615 (Code 087, Age 24, 04/12/47)Apparently J----, a very good friend of mine had just been married. There was a great gathering in what seemed to be the basement of a church. (Mine at home.) We were all waiting for the wedding party to arrive. Two tables had been set up and decorated with flowers. One table, for the wedding party and close friends, was very large. The other was quite small. I was there with a mutual friend of J--'s and mine (a girl). I was very much surprised to see a boy friend of my brothers come in and I went over to talk to him. (He is 2 yrs younger than I.) When the time came to sit down to supper this girl friend of mine and I sat down at the small table with him. Then the bride's mother asked J-- and I to come over to the other table. I was very anxious to go over to that table but when we were seated over there I felt so guilty about leaving the boy. I kept looking back to see how he was getting on all the time because he didn't know the other people. I felt sort of like a heel walking out on him. The wedding party never did show up and everyone went on eating.

This was the first time I'd seen him since I started to work there. He was all dressed up in a dark blue suit and a white shirt.

College women, late 1940s:#0617 (Code 087, Age 24, 04/20/47)I seem to have been traveling across country on a bus (going East). We pulled into a large city, dark & busy. I thought it was P_____ but the sign said N_____ D_____. 

Next I was in a department store, walking around looking at the various displays. When I came to the dress department I saw a beautiful evening dress and asked to try it on. It was black, off the shoulder with red roses scattered over it. After I had it on I decided to get a thrill and walked regally down a winding staircase to the first floor. There the doorman could get a taxi for me and I could whirl away. However, I only got halfway down the staircase and then turned around and started back. I couldn't find the way and wandered all around. All I wanted to do now was get the dress off. Suppose someone should see me. Of course, people were milling all around me. On an elevator I heard about a dress that had been stolen. Some place along the way 2 of my girlfriends had joined me. Now we found a room that had been an old anatomy lab. One of the girl's boy friend was waiting for her outside. I changed my clothes. We seemed to have a great discussion as to whether we should all wear stockings or socks. They had socks on but I had to put on stockings because my shoes were brown oxfords. Then the women that had shown me the dress came in. I gave it to her. She seemed so relieved, and asked me if she had given me permission. I said, "No, Ma'am."

College women, late 1940s:#0621 (Code 087, Age 24, 05/13/47)Several of my girl friends and I were in a deserted old farm house in the middle of enemy territory. The house had no furniture in it at all. (Except that later a crib appeared) We were sitting around not saying very much when we saw another girl and a child outside. We offered them shelter from the night and the soldiers. The chi]d, around 3-4 yrs., went to sleep in the crib. Shortly after that I saw a small group of enemy soldiers with flashlights coming toward the house. I ran to the crib and had to struggle to get the child out over the high sides. I kept hoping that the child would not start crying and yelling. My one object was to keep out of the way of the beams from the flashlights. I had to keep dodging around to do this, and could not get back to the front of the house where the others were. Once I felt the light shining on my face, but it moved on. To escape detection I put the baby and my se]f up against the outside wall of the house - (on the floor.)

There was a colored picture on that page. I decided to look through the magazine but wanted to begin at the page where the first colored picture appeared. I thought it would be just 4 or 5 pages back so I began leafing through the pages going toward the front of the book. However, the colored pictures never seemed to stop and I got all the way to the front cover without coming across a single black and white page. I thought it was so strange. Most of the pictures were landscapes and nature studies. The coloring was simply beautiful in all of them. One of them I remember pictured a young girl in a yellow dress lying in the grass on a hill top looking up at the puffy white clouds rolling by. I was sorry when I woke up because I wanted to see more of the pictures.

I met "E_____," one of the fellas I date. He ran over to me and tried to kiss me - He was with another girl who was "dressed up." She wore a black dress, pearls etc. I told him to stop bothering me and go back to his date. I told him at least I was the natural type (I was wearing bobby socks, skirt and sweater) and didn't get dressed up so "fancy" for class. As I was talking to him my best friend came down the hall with a fella. He looked exactly like "E_____" - but she called him "P_____." - The resemblance was amazing.

The part about E_____ wanting to kiss me in front of the girl and others too probably reflects the fact that he always in reality shows his affection for me in public - I dislike this and have told him many times to stop it. I stopped dating him for a few weeks - but I had "reports" of the other girls he dated in that time. Interpretation

I walked till I was away from houses & out in the empty fields, not thinking, just feeling the rhythm of the walk and the relaxed feeling.

College women, late 1940s:#0643 (Code 093, Age 22, 05/14/4?)I have a dim memory of having had a sentimental scene with a boy I have been dating off and on for some years. He's a chronic invalid, & in the dream he was regretting that he could never plan on marriage, because he wanted to marry me. Then I was discussing it with my mother - we both felt very sad about it. I told mother that a man I work with had just proposed to me, & I thought he was congenial & would make a good husband, but was not physically attractive to me, so I refused him--it was rather embarrassing. I wondered if he might have aroused me if I had ever permitted him to make love to me, & said to Mother, "But if you never try, how do you know?" 

(223 words)

The first situation is pretty close to reality, except that I go with the boy partly because we both know that he'll not be able to marry me --I doubt if I would be interested.

College women, late 1940s:#0644 (Code 093, Age 22, ??/??/4?)It was at our coming convention (I am running for president of our organization). I could see the crowded convention room, dimmed with smoke. I had been furiously taking minutes (I'm secretary) & had got up to speak on a topic that concerned me--I don't know what it was, but I was passionately sure they were all wrong--I got up to talk, feeling dizzy & tired, but made my point & went out for air, feeling utterly exhausted & beyond caring if the convention took my advice or not. One of the boys was outside--someone I'd met before--I was almost in hysterics by then & shaking--he took me in his arms and held me, then we sat down & I leaned on his shoulder & after awhile he kissed me gently. By then, feeling very tranquil, I went back to take minutes again. As I was coming back, the uproar hit me like a blow, & as I went in, I heard two of the boys talking about me. "Should we vote for her?" one of them asked, & the other answered, "I don't like her as a person, but she's got brains--I think I'll support her. I wonder if she's human, tho--cold as a fish." I tried to pretend I didn't care, & forced myself to go back to my place.

The utter exhaustion of conventions I have felt before--at the last convention, I did get dizzy when I got up to speak; I went to another room to rest, & came back, feeling the smoky, perspiration laden air & the noise like a blow.

The announcer cried in a loud voice a question (it was a quiz program) which I knew but couldn't think of the answer. "Spit it out, " he said with an exaggerated grin.

There were other things, because I kept dashing from one to the other. The souffle got done too soon, & began to dry out & to fall--the sauce for the vegetables bubbled over & then began to evaporate before my eyes--that's all I remember.

College women, late 1940s:#0673 (Code 106, Age 20, 03/14/48)I dreamed that I was in a country store in a town I had never seen before. I saw a girl in the front of the store crying. I went up to her and asked her what I could do to help. She saw a small suitcase I was holding and said she would like it. I gave her the suitcase and a small amount of money. She thanked me and walked out of the store. The next day I read in the newspaper that I would be called to the police station for questioning. The girl whom I had helped had been mutilated by a hatchet and my suitcase had been found near her dead body.

College women, late 1940s:#0674 (Code 106, Age 20, 03/??/48)The February freshman class at Art School was making a tour of the school. We seemed to walk in rows of two's although there wasn't much order and you were walking with a different person every few minutes. We passed the auditorium balcony where the rest of the school was having some sort of an assembly. The doors were open and we heard a boy make horrible noises on his accordion. The freshman class was very noisy, and I thought they should be quiet and not disturb the assembly. I got into an argument with one of the girls and told her she should not be so selfish. We continued arguing even when we passed into another hall. When we were through with the tour, our class met in one of the rooms where a woman was talking. I didn't listen, but talked to my girlfriend about my cousin and showed her a button he sent me from a New Zealand soldier's uniform. We wondered if the woman who was talking would know what the button was. The class was dismissed. 

After a time, our class joined the other assembly. I was going to sit on the balcony, but then I saw a boy who I liked very much and I started to go to where he was sitting. There were about five, empty chairs near him. There was a box on each chair and as I moved in the aisle, I threw away each box until I got next to him and I sat one seat away from this boy. There seemed to be a show on the stage and different girls would be called up to the stage to sing. I said to this boy one seat away, "Oh, dear! They're going to call me to sing and I can't sing!"
